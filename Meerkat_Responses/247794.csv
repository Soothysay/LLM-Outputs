   Imaging: CT Neck:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No definite evidence of airway narrowing. Moderate edema in the
   posterior oropharynx, without discrete fluid collection or abscess.
   2. Endotracheal tube tip positioned near the ostium of the right main
   stem
   bronchus. Tube should be withdrawn for more optimal positioning.
   3. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, predominantly in the right neck,
   though
   the exact site of injury, is not visualized on non-contrast CT.
   4. Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
   ------------------------------
   Echo:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the septum and anterior wall and
   severe hypokinesis of the rest of the segments. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %).
   Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
   restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   --------------------
   USD:
   IMPRESSION: Evidence of focal DVT in the right cephalic vein
   surrounding an
   indwelling PICC. Thrombus does not extend into the axillary, subclavian
   or IJ veins.

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIOMYOPATHY, OTHER
   Assessment and Plan
   79F with COPD, CAD, a fib, lung cancer, now with respiratory distress
   and septic shock now with clear evidence of recent cardiac event.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely resulting from septic shock (below).
   Acute episode of sob at rehab concerning for PNA versus PE (CTA
   negative) vs. CHF (mild chf on exam).  She does not have an obvious
   infiltrate on the CXR.
   - Intubated after a complicated course at OSH (pharyngeal laceration).
   - Currently with excellent ABG 7.4/37/146 on current vent settings,
   awaiting AM RISBI.  Probably could tolerate pressure support trial
   today but given complicated intubation may be preferable to wait until
   swelling resolves so as not to loose airway.
   - Nebs given history of COPD
   - No e/o significant CHF by X-ray although some increase in volume
   overload after fluids today.
   .
   # Shock:   patient with recent admission for c. difficilie coliits and
   has been on abx recently.  Ddx for sepis most likely urinary versus
   intrabdominal source vs. line sepsis.  She does have some LLQ
   tenderness on exam.  Given Echo findings unclear what component
   cardiogenic shock may play in presentation with also evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency given inadequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   yesterday.  Likely multifactorial with urosepsis precipitating shock in
   patient with newly depressed EF.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl, and wean levophed as tolerated.
   - check stool culture (c. diff)
 not sent yet
   - Urine culture, sputum culture, blood culture pending
   - CT abd/pelvis to eval for colitis -> need to give IV contrast and so
   need access.
   - IVF and levophed as needed to keep MAP >65 (difficult to get CVP, fem
   line)
 will discuss change from levophed to dobutamine or dopamine for
   pressure support.
   - broad spectrum abx and will cover broadly until micro data confirm
   sensitivity of organism.
   - Will cover with vanc (OSH PICC in place) + zosyn (recent Icu
   admission) + IV flagyl for recent c. diff
   - [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim -> low so would give steroids.
   - fingersticks for euglycemic control
   ..
   # CAD: Recent large anterior infarct, with EF 20-25%.
   - Aspirin 81mg daily
 consider increasing to 325mg daily
   - Start statin
 lipitor 80mg daily, check lipid panel
   - Add ACE/B-blocker once pressure allows.
   .
   # A fib:  rate controlled for now.  Supratherapeutic INR.  Continue
   coumadin on discharge.
   .
   # DVT: Supratherapeutic INR, hold anticoagulation until therapeutic
   [**12-23**].
   # Coagulopathy: Supratherapetic INR (on coumadin at home) hold coumadin
   for now.  Will check DIC labs.
   # post pharyngeal laceration:  CT showing free air but patent airway.
   # transaminitis: may be from hypotension would follow daily.
   .
   # Access: will need to re-site femoral line, once coagulopathy is
   reversed.  Most likely option is IJ under ultrasound.  A-line
   yesterday, will need peripheral IV or power-PICC for CT Abdomen/Pelvis

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, who presented with respiratory distress and septic shock. The patient underwent several procedures including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), bronchoscopy, and an ultrasound. The TEE showed a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 55% to 20-25%, indicating a recent cardiac event. There was also evidence of a focal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right cephalic vein. The patient's condition has been complicated by a pharyngeal laceration, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis and is being weaned off vasopressor support. The patient has multiple comorbidities including a recent large anterior myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and a history of colorectal colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory distress and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function due to underlying COPD, lung cancer, and potential complications from prolonged intubation.
2. Shock: The patient is currently in septic shock, which may be due to urinary or intrabdominal infection. There is also evidence of cardiogenic shock secondary to the recent decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of recent anterior myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition. 

Key Events:
- The patient underwent several invasive procedures including multi-lumen placement, arterial line insertion, trans-thoracic echo, bronchoscopy, and ultrasound.
- A thoracic surgery consult was obtained due to the presence of subcutaneous emphysema and inability to place both nasogastric and oral gastric tubes, revealing a 2-3 cm linear tear in the hypopharynx.
- A PICC line was removed and the tip was sent for culture.
- Bronchoscopy showed no tracheal/bronchial tear but revealed a linear mucosal injury in the posterior hypopharynx.
- CT neck revealed pharyngeal swelling but no clots or further extension of subcutaneous emphysema.
- The patient was placed on steroids, bolused with 2 liters of intravenous fluids, and received 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma.
- Evidence of focal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right cephalic vein was observed.
- Endotracheal tube placement was adjusted due to improper positioning.
- Multiple laboratory tests and imaging studies were performed to assess the patient's condition.

   2. Endotracheal tube tip positioned near the ostium of the right main
   stem
   bronchus. Tube should be withdrawn for more optimal positioning.
   3. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, predominantly in the right neck,
   though
   the exact site of injury, is not visualized on non-contrast CT.
   4. Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
   ------------------------------
   Echo:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the septum and anterior wall and
   severe hypokinesis of the rest of the segments. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %).
   Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
   restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIOMYOPATHY, OTHER
   Assessment and Plan
   79F with COPD, CAD, a fib, lung cancer, now with respiratory distress
   and septic shock now with clear evidence of recent cardiac event.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely resulting from septic shock (below).
   Acute episode of sob at rehab concerning for PNA versus PE (CTA
   negative) vs. CHF (mild chf on exam).  She does not have an obvious
   infiltrate on the CXR.
   - Intubated after a complicated course at OSH (pharyngeal laceration).
   - Currently with excellent ABG 7.4/37/146 on current [**Month/Day (2) **] settings,
   awaiting AM RISBI.  Probably could tolerate pressure support trial
   today but given complicated intubation may be preferable to wait until
   swelling resolves so as not to loose airway.
   - Nebs given history of COPD
   - No e/o significant CHF by X-ray although some increase in volume
   overload after fluids today.
   .
   #[**Month/Day (2) **] Management: Good RISBI this AM and could likely wean the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   will try pressure support today.  Trauma of intubation may necessitate
   trach or extended intubation given swelling.
   - Cuff leak: Slow, continue to monitor.  Consider change over wire
   discuss with thoracics
   - ET tube migrating distally despite frequent repositioning.
   .
   # Shock:   patient with recent admission for c. difficilie coliits and
   has been on abx recently.  Ddx for sepis most likely urinary versus
   intrabdominal source vs. line sepsis.  She does have some LLQ
   tenderness on exam.  Given Echo findings unclear what component
   cardiogenic shock may play in presentation with also evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency given inadequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   yesterday.  Likely multifactorial with urosepsis precipitating shock in
   patient with newly depressed EF.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl, and wean levophed as tolerated.  Bolus
   fluid for MAP < 65.
   - check stool culture (c. diff)
 not sent yet
   - Urine culture, sputum culture, blood culture pending
   - CT abd/pelvis to eval for colitis -> need to give IV contrast and so
   need access.
   - IVF and levophed as needed to keep MAP >65 (difficult to get CVP, fem
   line)
 will discuss change from levophed to dobutamine or dopamine for
   pressure support.
   - broad spectrum abx and will cover broadly until micro data confirm
   sensitivity of organism.
   - Will cover with vanc (OSH PICC in place) + zosyn (recent Icu
   admission) + IV flagyl for recent c. diff
   - [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim -> low so would give steroids.
   - fingersticks for euglycemic control
   ..
   # CAD: Recent large anterior infarct, with EF 20-25%.
   - Aspirin 81mg daily
 will give PR lasix for now.
   - Start statin when able
 lipitor 80mg daily, check lipid panel
   - Add ACE/B-blocker once pressure allows.
   .
   # A fib:  rate controlled for now.  Supratherapeutic INR.  Continue
   coumadin on discharge.
   .
   # DVT: Supratherapeutic INR, hold anticoagulation until therapeutic
   [**12-23**].
   # Coagulopathy: Supratherapetic INR (on coumadin at home) hold coumadin
   for now.  W/o DIC by labs.
   # transaminitis: may be from hypotension would follow daily.
   .
   # Access: will need to re-site femoral line, once coagulopathy is
   reversed.  Most likely option is IJ under ultrasound.  A-line
   yesterday, will need peripheral IV or power-PICC for CT Abdomen/Pelvis

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, who presented with respiratory distress and septic shock. The patient had a complicated course at OSH due to a pharyngeal laceration and was intubated. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressures set to maintain an ABG of 7.4/37/146.

The patient has evidence of a recent cardiac event, including a severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the septum and anterior wall, as well as severe hypokinesis of the rest of the segments. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is severely depressed at 20-25%. There is also mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient has a focal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right cephalic vein surrounding an indwelling percutaneous central catheter (PICC). There is no extension of the thrombus into the axillary, subclavian, or internal jugular veins.

The patient's management includes continuing vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and Flagyl for sepsis coverage. She will be weaned off levophed as tolerated and given bolus fluids for mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 65. The plan is to change from levophed to dobutamine or dopamine for pressure support.

   posterior oropharynx, without discrete fluid collection or abscess.
   2. Endotracheal tube tip positioned near the ostium of the right main
   stem
   bronchus. Tube should be withdrawn for more optimal positioning.
   3. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, predominantly in the right neck,
   though
   the exact site of injury, is not visualized on non-contrast CT.
   4. Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
   ------------------------------
   Echo:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the septum and anterior wall and
   severe hypokinesis of the rest of the segments. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %).
   Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
   restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIOMYOPATHY, OTHER
   Assessment and Plan
   79F with COPD, CAD, a fib, lung cancer, now with respiratory distress
   and septic shock now with clear evidence of recent cardiac event.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely resulting from septic shock (below).
   Acute episode of sob at rehab concerning for PNA versus PE (CTA
   negative) vs. CHF (mild chf on exam).  She does not have an obvious
   infiltrate on the CXR.
   - Intubated after a complicated course at OSH (pharyngeal laceration).
   - Currently with excellent ABG 7.4/37/146 on current [**Month/Day (2) **] settings,
   awaiting AM RISBI.  Probably could tolerate pressure support trial
   today but given complicated intubation may be preferable to wait until
   swelling resolves so as not to loose airway.
   - Nebs given history of COPD
   - No e/o significant CHF by X-ray although some increase in volume
   overload after fluids today.
   .
   #[**Month/Day (2) **] Management: Good RISBI this AM and could likely wean the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   will try pressure support today.  Trauma of intubation may necessitate
   trach or extended intubation given swelling.
   - Cuff leak: Slow, continue to monitor.  Consider change over wire
   discuss with thoracics
   - ET tube migrating distally despite frequent repositioning.
   .
   # Shock:   patient with recent admission for c. difficilie coliits and
   has been on abx recently.  Ddx for sepis most likely urinary versus
   intrabdominal source vs. line sepsis.  She does have some LLQ
   tenderness on exam.  Given Echo findings unclear what component
   cardiogenic shock may play in presentation with also evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency given inadequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   yesterday.  Likely multifactorial with urosepsis precipitating shock in
   patient with newly depressed EF.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl, and wean levophed as tolerated.  Bolus
   fluid for MAP < 65.
   - check stool culture (c. diff)
 not sent yet
   - Urine culture, sputum culture, blood culture pending
   - CT abd/pelvis to eval for colitis -> need to give IV contrast and so
   need access.
   - IVF and levophed as needed to keep MAP >65 (difficult to get CVP, fem
   line)
 will discuss change from levophed to dobutamine or dopamine for
   pressure support.
   - broad spectrum abx and will cover broadly until micro data confirm
   sensitivity of organism.
   - Will cover with vanc (OSH PICC in place) + zosyn (recent Icu
   admission) + IV flagyl for recent c. diff
   - [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim -> low so would give steroids.
   - fingersticks for euglycemic control
   ..
   # CAD: Recent large anterior infarct, with EF 20-25%.
   - Aspirin 81mg daily
 will give PR lasix for now.
   - Start statin when able
 lipitor 80mg daily, check lipid panel
   - Add ACE/B-blocker once pressure allows.
   .
   # A fib:  rate controlled for now.  Supratherapeutic INR.  Continue
   coumadin on discharge.
   .
   # DVT: Supratherapeutic INR, hold anticoagulation until therapeutic
   [**12-23**].
   # Coagulopathy: Supratherapetic INR (on coumadin at home) hold coumadin
   for now.  W/o DIC by labs.
   # transaminitis: may be from hypotension would follow daily.
   .
   # Access: will need to re-site femoral line, once coagulopathy is
   reversed.  Most likely option is IJ under ultrasound.  A-line
   yesterday, will need peripheral IV or power-PICC for CT Abdomen/Pelvis
   ICU Care

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, and recent cardiac events. She presented with respiratory distress and septic shock. The patient had a complicated course, including a pharyngeal laceration requiring intubation and a recent large anterior myocardial infarction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20-25%. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, and shock. The respiratory failure is likely due to septic shock. The cardiomyopathy is a result of the recent cardiac event and the low ejection fraction. 

The patient's management plan includes weaning off the ventilator with pressure support, consideration for tracheostomy or extended intubation due to swelling, changing over the endotracheal tube, and addressing potential sources of sepsis such as urinary tract infection or intra-abdominal infection. 

The patient's medications include vanc (vancomycin), zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam), and flagyl (metronidazole) for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, as well as dobutamine or dopamine for hemodynamic support. 

Further diagnostic tests include a CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for colitis, blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures. The patient's coagulopathy needs to be managed, and the access for further procedures needs to be established"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill female with a history of pharyngeal tear, cuff leak, hemodynamics indicating mixed sepsis and possible ischemic heart disease. She has a coagulopathy and requires reversal of anticoagulation due to bleeding risk. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, pressor-dependent, and has low ejection fraction. She is also experiencing stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hemodynamics suggest a mixed picture with sepsis as a likely contributing factor. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

2. Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient has new wall motion abnormalities and echo abnormalities, indicating possible ischemic heart disease. Ischemic heart disease occurs when there is reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, which can lead to chest pain, heart attack, or even heart failure.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which means her blood's ability to clot is impaired. This increases the risk of excessive bleeding, especially if there are any procedures or surgeries needed.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. Prolonged ventilation can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and lung injury.

5. Stress Ulcers"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of pharyngeal tear, cuff leak, hemodynamics instability, new ant wall motion abnormality, and coagulopathy. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for suspected sepsis with multiple antibiotics. There is a concern for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers. The patient's condition remains unstable, and further evaluation and treatment are required.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the deep veins, especially due to prolonged immobilization. This can lead to serious complications like pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular chest X-rays will be necessary to identify any signs of infection.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at an increased risk of developing stress ulcers due to the body's stress response. Prophylactic measures like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be needed to prevent gastric ulcers.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status should be closely monitored as they may be at risk of bleeding or clotting disorders. Regular monitoring of clot"

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIOMYOPATHY, OTHER
   79F with COPD, CAD, a fib, lung cancer, now with respiratory distress
   and septic shock now with clear evidence of recent cardiac event.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely resulting from septic shock (below).
   Acute episode of sob at rehab concerning for PNA versus PE (CTA
   negative) vs. CHF (mild chf on exam).  She does not have an obvious
   infiltrate on the CXR.
   - Intubated after a complicated course at OSH (pharyngeal laceration).
   - Currently with excellent ABG 7.4/37/146 on current [**Month/Day (4) **] settings,
   awaiting AM RISBI.  Probably could tolerate pressure support trial
   today but given complicated intubation may be preferable to wait until
   swelling resolves so as not to loose airway.
   - Nebs given history of COPD
   - No e/o significant CHF by X-ray although some increase in volume
   overload after fluids today.
   .
   #[**Month/Day (4) **] Management: Good RISBI this AM and could likely wean the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   will try pressure support today.  Trauma of intubation may necessitate
   trach or extended intubation given swelling.
   - Cuff leak: Slow, continue to monitor.  Consider change over wire
   discuss with thoracics
   - ET tube migrating distally despite frequent repositioning.
   .
   # Shock:   patient with recent admission for c. difficilie coliits and
   has been on abx recently.  Ddx for sepis most likely urinary versus
   intrabdominal source vs. line sepsis.  She does have some LLQ
   tenderness on exam.  Given Echo findings unclear what component
   cardiogenic shock may play in presentation with also evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency given inadequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   yesterday.  Likely multifactorial with urosepsis precipitating shock in
   patient with newly depressed EF.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl, and wean levophed as tolerated.  Bolus
   fluid for MAP < 65.
   - check stool culture (c. diff)
 not sent yet
   - Urine culture, sputum culture, blood culture pending
   - CT abd/pelvis to eval for colitis -> need to give IV contrast and so
   need access.
   - IVF and levophed as needed to keep MAP >65 (difficult to get CVP, fem
   line)
 will discuss change from levophed to dobutamine or dopamine for
   pressure support.
   - broad spectrum abx and will cover broadly until micro data confirm
   sensitivity of organism.
   - Will cover with vanc (OSH PICC in place) + zosyn (recent Icu
   admission) + IV flagyl for recent c. diff
   - steroids for another 24 hours then d/c in AM given clinically
   improving
   - fingersticks for euglycemic control
   ..
   # CAD: Recent large anterior infarct, with EF 20-25%.
   - Aspirin 81mg daily  per NGT
   - Start statin today
   - Add ACE/B-blocker once pressure allows.
   .
   # A fib:  rate controlled for now.  Follow INR daily, 1.6 this AM may
   need heparing gtt, received vit K yesterday. PPM to be interrogated by
   EP today.
   .
   # DVT: Follow INR closely, INR 1.6 today
   # Coagulopathy: Received Vit K and FFP o/n, INR 1.6 this AM, will need
   to follow closely, placed on SQ heparin, may need heparin gtt if still
   low
   # Transaminitis: may be from hypotension would follow daily. Have
   normalized
   .
   # Access: will attempt PICC line placement, if unsuccessful will need
   LIJ, difficulty in regards to pacer wires, thrombus, prior PICC on left
   side

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, who presented with respiratory distress and septic shock. She has had an acute episode of shortness of breath, likely due to pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or congestive heart failure. The patient was intubated after a complicated course at OSH and currently requires respiratory support. She also has a recent large anterior myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. She has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled for now, and a deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and septic shock may result in respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's recent myocardial infarction and low ejection fraction increase the risk of cardiogenic shock.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The inadequate response to stress stimulation suggests a possible adrenal insufficiency.
4. Urosepsis: Given the urinary tract infection, there is a risk of urosepsis, which can worsen the patient's condition.
5. Intrabdominal source of sepsis: The patient's lower left quadrant tenderness on examination raises the possibility of an intrabdominal source of infection.
6. Line sepsis: The presence of central lines increases the risk of line-associated bloodstream infections.

   Acute episode of sob at rehab concerning for PNA versus PE (CTA
   negative) vs. CHF (mild chf on exam).  She does not have an obvious
   infiltrate on the CXR.
   - Intubated after a complicated course at OSH (pharyngeal laceration).
   - Currently with excellent ABG 7.4/37/146 on current [**Month/Day (4) **] settings,
   awaiting AM RISBI.  Probably could tolerate pressure support trial
   today but given complicated intubation may be preferable to wait until
   swelling resolves so as not to loose airway.
   - Nebs given history of COPD
   - No e/o significant CHF by X-ray although some increase in volume
   overload after fluids today.
   .
   #[**Month/Day (4) **] Management: Good RISBI this AM and could likely wean the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   will try pressure support today.  Trauma of intubation may necessitate
   trach or extended intubation given swelling.
   - Cuff leak: Slow, continue to monitor.  Consider change over wire
   discuss with thoracics
   - ET tube migrating distally despite frequent repositioning.
   .
   # Shock:   patient with recent admission for c. difficilie coliits and
   has been on abx recently.  Ddx for sepis most likely urinary versus
   intrabdominal source vs. line sepsis.  She does have some LLQ
   tenderness on exam.  Given Echo findings unclear what component
   cardiogenic shock may play in presentation with also evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency given inadequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   yesterday.  Likely multifactorial with urosepsis precipitating shock in
   patient with newly depressed EF.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl, and wean levophed as tolerated.  Bolus
   fluid for MAP < 65.
   - check stool culture (c. diff)
 not sent yet
   - Urine culture, sputum culture, blood culture pending
   - CT abd/pelvis to eval for colitis -> need to give IV contrast and so
   need access.
   - IVF and levophed as needed to keep MAP >65 (difficult to get CVP, fem
   line)
 will discuss change from levophed to dobutamine or dopamine for
   pressure support.
   - broad spectrum abx and will cover broadly until micro data confirm
   sensitivity of organism.
   - Will cover with vanc (OSH PICC in place) + zosyn (recent Icu
   admission) + IV flagyl for recent c. diff
   - [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim -> low so would give steroids.
   - fingersticks for euglycemic control
   ..
   # CAD: Recent large anterior infarct, with EF 20-25%.
   - Aspirin 81mg daily
 will give PR lasix for now.
   - Start statin when able
 lipitor 80mg daily, check lipid panel
   - Add ACE/B-blocker once pressure allows.
   .
   # A fib:  rate controlled for now.  Supratherapeutic INR.  Continue
   coumadin on discharge.
   .
   # DVT: Supratherapeutic INR, hold anticoagulation until therapeutic
   [**12-23**].
   # Coagulopathy: Supratherapetic INR (on coumadin at home) hold coumadin
   for now.  W/o DIC by labs.
   # transaminitis: may be from hypotension would follow daily.
   .
   # Access: will need to re-site femoral line, once coagulopathy is
   reversed.  Most likely option is IJ under ultrasound.  A-line
   yesterday, will need peripheral IV or power-PICC for CT Abdomen/Pelvis

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, and recent cardiac event. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, septic shock, and has a complicated intubation history. The patient also has a recent admission for Clostridioides difficile colitis and has been on antibiotics recently. She has tenderness in the lower left quadrant, indicating a possible urinary or intrabdominal source of infection. There are also findings suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to septic shock. This condition can worsen if not managed properly.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of CAD and recent cardiac event, which has resulted in a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. This makes her more susceptible to complications related to cardiac dysfunction.
3. Septic Shock: The patient is currently in septic shock, likely due to a urinary or intrabdominal infection. Prompt and appropriate management is crucial to prevent further complications.
4. Complicated Intubation: The patient's intubation was complicated, and she has a cuff leak that needs to be addressed. There is a risk of airway loss if not managed correctly.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's inadequate response to [Last Name (un) 45]"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, and recent cardiac event. She presented with respiratory distress and septic shock, which likely resulted in respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing a complicated course at OSH due to a pharyngeal laceration and required intubation. She tolerated pressure support well, and her ABG this morning was excellent. The main issues related to volume overload, and she will be diuresed today. There are concerns about possible extubation tomorrow.

The patient also has cardiomyopathy, likely resulting from a recent cardiac event. She has an ejection fraction of 20-25% and requires treatment for CAD, including aspirin, statin, and ACE/B-blocker once her pressure allows. She also has atrial fibrillation, for which rate control is being implemented.

The patient's anemia and hemolysis labs are pending, along with stool guiacs and transfusion as needed. There are concerns about DVT, coagulopathy, and transaminitis. The patient's access for medication administration is being attempted through PICC line placement, but there are difficulties related to prior PICC on the left side.

ICU care includes starting total parenteral nutrition (TF) today, maintaining glycemic control, and using prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress:

1. The patient has a history of dyspnea and is intubated.
2. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy.
3. The patient has a pharyngeal tear, which requires close monitoring and possible long-term management.
4. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to upper airway edema and volume overload.
5. The patient has a mixed picture of sepsis initiation and cardiogenic shock, with recent improvement in hemodynamics after fluid administration.
6. The patient has new anterolateral wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram, likely due to a past event.
7. The patient has a coagulopathy that needs to be managed, especially during procedures.
8. The patient requires ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and risk factors.
3. Nosocomial infections due to invasive lines and procedures.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with a pharyngeal tear, respiratory distress, and a positive blood culture indicating a possible infection. These factors suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to an upper airway edema. The patient was initially maintained on mechanical ventilation but is now volume overloaded. There is a plan to try diuresis and follow ABGs to determine if the patient can pass a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and potentially be extubated over a Cook catheter.

3. Hemodynamics: The patient's hemodynamic status is mixed, with signs of sepsis and potential sources of pneumonia and a PICC infection (now removed). The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, which requires anticoagulation management to prevent thromboembolic events.

4. New anterior wall motion abnormality: The patient has developed a new echo abnormality, likely due to an event that occurred within the past three weeks. However, there is no evidence of acute ischemia based on enzymes, ECG, and repeat ECG is planned for further evaluation.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient needs reversal"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Pharyngeal Tear: stable oxygenation and ventilation, follow up CT
   stable sq air in neck but ++ swelling. ABX, daily CXR
   Will have ENT see this AM to discuss criterai for extubation, comment
   on long term management of pharyngeal injury
   2. Resp Distress: initailly maintained on mech vent for upper airway
   edema but now volume overloaded. Will try diuresis and follow ABGs-If
   passes SBT will need to discuss with ENT/IP possibel extubate over Cook
   catheter
   3. Hemodynamics:  likely mixed picture with sepsis initating and but
   now cardioigenic dominating
                                    With ++ fluid we were able to wean off
   levophed but she is not in mild pulm edema, will Rx with Lasix gtts and
   follow up
 goal 1L neg as BP can tolerate.
   4. New Ant Wall motion abnl: new echo abnl. Likely due to event
   sometime in past 3 weeks but no acute event based on enzymes,  ECG, no
   evidence of active ischemia, ASA, statin, bblocker when BP can tolerate
   5. Coagulopathy: as anticoag for Afib

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIOMYOPATHY, OTHER
   79F with COPD, CAD, a fib, lung cancer, now with respiratory distress
   and septic shock now with clear evidence of recent cardiac event.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely resulting from septic shock (below).
   Acute episode of sob at rehab concerning for PNA versus PE (CTA
   negative) vs. CHF (mild chf on exam).  She does not have an obvious
   infiltrate on the CXR.
   - Intubated after a complicated course at OSH (pharyngeal laceration).
   - Check ABG this morning and if place on PS pending result, will not
   need tracheostomy per thoracic surgery, main issues related to volume
   overload, will continue diuresis today, watch throughout day on PS and
   plan on possible extubation tomorrow
   - issue regarding SQ emphysema has remained stable and low concern for
   esophageal injury
   - pharyngeal edema stable
   - Nebs given history of COPD.
   .
   # Shock:   patient with recent admission for c. difficilie coliits and
   has been on abx recently.  Ddx for sepis most likely urinary versus
   intrabdominal source vs. line sepsis.  She does have some LLQ
   tenderness on exam.  Given Echo findings unclear what component
   cardiogenic shock may play in presentation with also evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency given inadequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   yesterday.  Likely multifactorial with urosepsis precipitating shock in
   patient with newly depressed EF.
   - off pressors, switched zosyn to cefepime, continue vanco and flagyl,
   d/w ID, C.diff pendin
   - check stool culture (c. diff)
 negative times 2
   - Urine culture growing >100,000 GNR, f/u speciation
   - SCn from blood cx, likely contaminant, f/u cx ngtd thus far, continue
   vanco for now
   - d/c steroids
   - fingersticks for euglycemic control
   ..
   # CAD: Recent large anterior infarct, with EF 20-25%.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily  per NGT
   - statin
   - Add ACE/B-blocker once pressure allows.
   .
   # A fib:  rate controlled for now.  Follow INR daily, 1.6 this AM may
   need heparing gtt, received vit K yesterday. PPM to be interrogated by
   EP today.
   .
   #  Anemia- retic count low, % sat <25, ferritin >400 in setting stress
   response, iron 43, all this most suggestive of chronic disease with
   component iron deficiency, would add iron supplementation. stools guiac
   negative thus far
   .
   # DVT: Follow INR closely, INR 1.6 today
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Received Vit K and FFP o/n, INR 1.6 this AM, will need
   to follow closely, placed on SQ heparin, may need heparin gtt if still
   low
   # Transaminitis: may be from hypotension would follow daily. Have
   normalized
   .
   # Access: will attempt PICC line placement, if unsuccessful will need
   LIJ, difficulty in regards to pacer wires, thrombus, prior PICC on left
   side

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, cardiomyopathy, and recent large anterior myocardial infarction (EF 20-25%). She presented with respiratory distress and septic shock, likely resulting from a urinary tract infection (UTI) or intra-abdominal source. The patient also has evidence of recent cardiac events and inadequate response to steroid stimulation.

The patient underwent intubation after experiencing a complicated course at OSH due to a pharyngeal laceration. She has been on antibiotics for C. difficile colitis and has a history of recent use of anticoagulants. The patient's recent large anterior infarct has resulted in an ejection fraction of 20-25%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 89/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. Her heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, decreased hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L. Other lab results are"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman who is critically ill with respiratory failure, sepsis, and heart failure. She requires mechanical ventilation and has a pharyngeal tear, respiratory distress, hypotension, and new wall motion abnormality on echo. She also has a coagulopathy and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and prolonged intubation increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. DVT/PE: The patient's immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT and potentially subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's underlying heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload and the stress on the heart from sepsis.
4. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a risk of further complications or deterioration.
5. Ventilator-associated complications: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated complications such as VAP.
6. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding, especially during procedures or if anticoagulation is reversed.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's critical condition and inability to eat orally may lead to malnutrition if proper nutrition support is not provided.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient experienced an unplanned extubation at 01:48 PM on [**2109-3-28**] but did not have any stridor and showed increased work of breathing. The patient's allergies include sulfa (sulfonamides), unknown; verapamil, unknown. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient is also receiving midazolam (Versed), furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/68 to 124/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight is 74 kg, and height is 62 inches. The central venous pressure is 25.8 mmHg. The patient has received a total of 1,599 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 2,324 mL including 1,125 mL of urine. The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with set tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas values are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears anxious, has crackles in the chest, soft abdomen, and normal cardiovascular examination. Neurologic examination is not assessed. Laboratory results show normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and liver enzymes. The patient has elevated white blood cell count, lactic acid, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The patient's microbiology results indicate yeast in the sputum and an unspecified gram-negative rod in the urine.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is critically ill and requires ICU care. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a pulmonary formula at 10 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line and an arterial line. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia is being provided. The patient's code status is full code, and the patient is expected to remain in the ICU. The patient's family was informed during a meeting. The patient's total time spent in the ICU is 40 minutes."

 Likely resulting from septic shock (below).
   Acute episode of sob at rehab concerning for PNA versus PE (CTA
   negative) vs. CHF (mild chf on exam).  She does not have an obvious
   infiltrate on the CXR.
   - Intubated after a complicated course at OSH (pharyngeal laceration).
   - Check ABG this morning and if place on PS pending result, will not
   need tracheostomy per thoracic surgery, main issues related to volume
   overload, will continue diuresis today, watch throughout day on PS and
   plan on possible extubation tomorrow
   - issue regarding SQ emphysema has remained stable and low concern for
   esophageal injury
   - pharyngeal edema stable
   - Nebs given history of COPD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, and recent cardiac event. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, septic shock, cardiomyopathy, and other conditions. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications including a complicated course at OSH with pharyngeal laceration, intolerance to pressure support, and potential esophageal injury. She has also had an episode of Clostridium difficile colitis and has been on antibiotics recently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, likely resulting from septic shock and component of congestive heart failure. She has tolerated pressure support and may be extubated once further optimized.
2. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which could be due to urinary, intrabdominal source, or line sepsis. She has been on antibiotics and has shown inadequate response to stress.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has a recent history of a large anterior infarct with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. This could contribute to cardiogenic shock.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal insufficiency given her inadequate response to stress and low cortisol levels.
5. DVT: The patient has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis and is on heparin gtt for prophylaxis.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a reticulocyte count low and ferritin >400, suggesting chronic disease with component iron deficiency. Iron supplementation has been added.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which may be due to hypotension. Liver function tests will be followed daily.
8. A-Line: The patient self-removed an arterial line yesterday but no evidence of compartment syndrome was found.
9. Access: The patient's access for medication and fluid administration will be attempted through a PICC line placement, if unsuccessful, a lower intravenous junction (LIJ) may be necessary.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional details and tests may be required to provide a comprehensive analysis."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F critically ill with respiratory failure requiring mechanical
   ventailation, resolving sepsis, and heart failure.
   1. Pharyngeal Tear: stable oxygenation and ventilation, no
   stridor/aiway compromise when self-extubated.  Currently has small cuff
   leak when ETT balloon deflated. ENT will formally consult when
   extubated but agrees with current plan.
   2. Resp Distress: intubated for airway protection and also CHF.  Vol
   overload now primary issue.  Tolerating PSV.  SBT today.  Cont
   diuresis.  Possible extubation in AM if stable. Follow ABGs.
   3. Hemodynamics:  hypotension, off pressors x several days.  Now volume
   overloaded - cont gentle diuresis (goal 500cc-1L neg) as tolerated by
   BP and renal function.
   4. New ant wall motion abnl and depressed EF: Pt likely had an event
   sometime in the past couple of weeks but no acute event based on
   enzymes, ECG.  ASA/statin; bblocker when BP can tolerate.
   5.  Leukocytosis: WBC increased from 12 to 19. Likely due to steroids
   and stress of reintubation. UTI may not be adequately treated, and
   other concerns include c diff and ?retropharyngeal abscess vs.
   mediastinitis.  Checking c diff and neck/chest CTs. (Addendum: CT neck
   shows no abscess)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, squamous cell and small cell lung cancer, AF on coumadin, and recent admission for C. difficile colitis. She was found minimally responsive at a nursing home with suspected respiratory distress. Intubation attempts failed due to retropharyngeal trauma/soft tissue laceration, and a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed. The patient was then taken to the operating room for successful intubation and transferred to the ICU.

The patient initially presented with hypotension and required vasopressors, suggesting a possible septic shock component along with cardiogenic shock. There was also evidence of retropharyngeal swelling and subcutaneous emphysema on a neck CT scan. However, the patient was oxygenating and ventilating well, without any issues with stridor when briefly self-extubated. She was reintubated due to increased work of breathing and volume overload.

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is currently critically ill with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, resolving sepsis, and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pharyngeal Tear: The patient has a stable airway with no stridor or airway compromise when self-extubated. However, there is a small cuff leak when the endotracheal"

   stridor/aiway compromise when self-extubated.  ENT will formally
   consult when extubated but agrees with current plan.
   2. Resp Distress: intubated for airway protection and also CHF.  Vol
   overload now primary issue.  Tolerating PSV.  SBT today.  Cont
   diuresis.  Possible extubation this afternoon, though want to make sure
   she is as buffed as possible given....  Follow ABGs since a-line d/c'd.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including COPD, CAD, squamous cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer status post resection, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and recent admission for Clostridium difficile colitis. The patient presented with airway trauma, respiratory failure, and shock.

The patient's condition has been complex and dynamic. Initially, there were failed attempts at intubation resulting in retropharynx trauma/soft tissue laceration. A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed, and the patient was taken to the operating room for intubation. In the emergency department, the patient was hypothermic with a blood pressure in the 90s. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed bilateral pleural effusions and subcutaneous gas in the neck. Shock was presumed to be septic, with potential sources including urinary tract infection (with >100,000 colony-forming units of Gram-negative rods), intra-abdominal infection, or line sepsis. The patient received several liters of intravenous fluids, levophed (which was subsequently discontinued), and broad-spectrum antibiotics covering Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. Corticosteroids were also administered for negative stimulus.

Stable oxygenation and ventilation were achieved, and a follow-up neck CT showed stable subcut"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, squamous cell and small cell lung cancer status post resection, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and recent admission for Clostridium difficile colitis. She presented minimally responsive with unknown symptoms of shortness of breath. The patient failed intubation attempts due to retropharynx trauma/soft tissue laceration and was eventually intubated via a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and initially hypotensive, requiring pressors likely due to septic and cardiogenic components with newly decreased ejection fraction (EF). Now, the patient is volume overloaded. A CT scan showed retropharyngeal swelling and subcutaneous emphysema on the neck but is oxygenating and ventilating adequately without issues with stridor when briefly self-extubated. The patient's code status has been changed to do not resuscitate (DNR), vancomycin and flagyl were discontinued, and cefepime will be continued for urinary tract infection (UTI). Heparin gtt was started for low INR but was held until bleeding controlled after massive bleeding from self-removed arterial line. Allergies include sulfa and verapamil.

The patient's daughter was updated on Mrs. [Known lastname 2628]'s progress. The daughter expressed a preference for the patient to be reintubated if she experiences difficulty breathing after extubation. She still does not want CPR or any resuscitation. It is planned to extubate the patient later today or tomorrow morning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Difficulty breathing after extubation: Since the patient's daughter prefers reintubation if her mother has difficulty breathing, this indicates a potential complication related to respiratory function. 

Please note that without the complete progress note, it is difficult to determine all possible complications. Additional information about the patient's medical condition, current treatments, and any other existing complications would be necessary for a more comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with COPD, CAD, a fib, lung cancer, now with respiratory distress
   and septic shock now with clear evidence of recent cardiac event.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely resulting from septic shock (below) with
   component of CHF.  Self extubated yesterday but did not tolerate and
   had to be reintubated.  Today, RISBI again good, and could likely be
   extubated.  Has diuresed a bit since self extubating but would like to
   further optimize prior to re-attempting given patient has now had
   several intubation attempts.
   - Intubated after a complicated course at OSH (pharyngeal laceration).
   - tolerating pressure support, will wean support settings.  Get ABG on
   pressure support
   - issue regarding SQ emphysema has remained stable and low concern for
   esophageal injury
   - pharyngeal edema stable
   - Nebs given history of COPD.
   .
   # Shock:   patient with recent admission for c. difficilie coliits and
   has been on abx recently.  Ddx for sepis most likely urinary versus
   intrabdominal source vs. line sepsis.  She did  have some LLQ
   tenderness on exam.  Given Echo findings unclear what component
   cardiogenic shock may play in presentation with also evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency given inadequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   yesterday.  Likely multifactorial with urosepsis precipitating shock in
   patient with newly depressed EF.
   - off pressors, switched zosyn to cefepime while awaiting speciation
   urine cx, d/c vanco and flagyl, d/w ID, C.diff negative times 2
 but
   will restart cefepime given sensitivities on Urine Culture.
   - check stool culture (c. diff)
 negative times 2
   - Urine culture growing >100,000 GNR, -- Klebsiella Pneumoniae
   sensitive to cefepime.
   - SCn from blood cx, likely contaminant, f/u cx ngtd thus far, continue
   vanco for now
   - d/c steroids
   - goal diuresis of 500cc today.
   .
   # CAD: Recent large anterior infarct, with EF 20-25%.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Add ACE/B-blocker once pressure allows.
   .
   # A fib:  rate controlled for now.  Follow INR daily, 1.3, received vit
   K. PPM interrogated by EP, device working well, place on heparin gtt
   .
   #  Anemia- retic count low, % sat <25, ferritin >400 in setting stress
   response, iron 43, all this most suggestive of chronic disease with
   component iron deficiency, would add iron supplementation. stools guiac
   negative thus far
   - 1 Unit PRBC yesterday given CAD, although overloaded, risk vs.
   benefit
   .
   # DVT: Received Vit K and FFP o/n, INR 1.3, place on heparin gtt
   .
   # Transaminitis: may be from hypotension would follow daily. Have
   normalized
   .
   # A-Line: self d
d yesterday.  Held pressure for 2 hours.  No e/o
   compartment syndrome at this time but will continue to monitor.
   .
   # Access: will attempt PICC line placement, if unsuccessful will need
   LIJ, difficulty in regards to pacer wires, thrombus, prior PICC on left
   side, t o be done in IR

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, who presented with respiratory distress and septic shock. She has had multiple intubation attempts and is currently on pressure support. The patient also has evidence of a recent cardiac event and clear evidence of a recent cardiac event. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is still in need of further optimization before attempting extubation again.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to septic shock and a component of congestive heart failure. She has been intubated multiple times, and it is crucial to carefully manage her respiratory support settings.
2. Shock: The patient has septic shock, which could be due to a urinary tract infection, intrabdominal source, or line sepsis. Given her recent admission for Clostridium difficile colitis and recent antibiotic use, there is a concern for urosepsis. Additionally, the patient has evidence of adrenal insufficiency, making her response to stress inadequate.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and a recent large anterior myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. She is on aspirin, atorvastatin, and will require an ACE/B-blocker once her blood pressure allows.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. She also has allergies to sulfa drugs and verapamil.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 412 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 32, and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 10 cmH2O.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,483 mL and output of 4,160 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,677 mL. The patient has received a total of 975 mL of intravenous fluids, 249 mL of tube feeds, and 155 mL of oral intake.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, blood glucose of 119 mg/dL, platelet count of 277 K/uL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, and chloride of 105 mEq/L. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.29, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 40 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 80 mmHg.

The patient's medical history includes an episode of sepsis with Klebsiella pneumonia, for which she was treated with vancomycin, metronidazole, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with heparin.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumonia and has shown improvement with the current antibiotic regimen. The patient's DNR (do not resuscitate) status was discussed with the family, and they prefer extubation if the patient fails her spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient will continue to receive ICU care, including glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and V"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, who presented with respiratory distress and septic shock. She has clear evidence of a recent cardiac event and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient successfully extubated today, with a CT scan showing no evidence of abscess and resolution of subcutaneous air. There are residual bilateral pleural effusions present. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to septic shock with a component of congestive heart failure (CHF). This has resulted in her being placed on mechanical ventilation.
2. Klebsiella UTI: The patient has a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) that has caused septic shock, which has now resolved. She will be completing a 10-day course of Zosyn antibiotic therapy.
3. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent large anterior myocardial infarction, resulting in an ejection fraction of 20-25%. She will be started on aspirin and atorvastatin for CAD management.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled for now, with daily follow-up of INR levels. She will be attempting to restart Coumadin therapy tomorrow.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female who is critically ill with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, resolving sepsis, and heart failure. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Pharyngeal Tear: The patient has a pharyngeal tear which is currently stable with no stridor or airway compromise when self-extubated. However, there is a concern for potential complications related to the tear such as infection or worsening of the tear itself.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient was intubated for airway protection and also due to congestive heart failure (CHF). The main issue now is volume overload, but the patient has responded well to diuretic therapy. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory distress if the patient develops fluid overload again or if the underlying CHF worsens.

3. Hemodynamics: The patient has been hypotensive but is now off pressors. However, there is a concern for volume overload as indicated by the ongoing gentle diuresis to maintain a negative fluid balance. There is a risk of developing hypotension again if the diuresis is not properly managed.

4. New Anterior Wall Motion Abnormality and Depressed Ejection Fraction: The patient has developed a new anterior wall motion abnormality and depressed ejection fraction. This suggests a possible past myocardial infarction or other cardiac event. The patient may be at increased risk"

   hrs this am w/ABG 7.46/42/86.  Extubate this am.
   3. Hemodynamics:  hypotension, off pressors x several days.  Now volume
   overloaded - cont gentle diuresis (goal 500cc-1L neg) as tolerated by
   BP and renal function.
   4. New ant wall motion abnl and depressed EF: Pt likely had an event
   sometime in the past couple of weeks but no acute event based on
   enzymes, ECG.  ASA/statin; BB/ACEI when BP can tolerate.  Rpt TTE in a
   couple of weeks.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is an 79-year-old female who is critically ill with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, resolving sepsis, and heart failure. She has a pharyngeal tear with stable oxygenation and ventilation, no airway compromise when self-extubated, and a cuff leak when the endotracheal tube balloon is deflated. There is also evidence of resolving subcutaneous emphysema in the neck. The patient is intubated for airway protection and also has congestive heart failure. She has been experiencing respiratory distress and has undergone a significant diuresis. She is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is expected to be extubated in the morning.

The patient's hemodynamics are stable, but she is volume overloaded and will continue with gentle diuresis as tolerated by blood pressure and renal function. A new anterior wall motion abnormality and depressed ejection fraction have been observed, indicating a possible past cardiac event. The patient will be started on aspirin and statin, and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram will be done in a couple of weeks.

The patient also has a Klebsiella urinary tract infection that is being treated with Zosyn for a complete 10-day course. She is also being monitored for atrial fibrillation, which has been rate-controlled, and she is on heparin drip. The plan is to restart Coumadin tomorrow if she remains"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a critical illness involving respiratory failure, resolving sepsis, and heart failure. She has been intubated for airway protection and management of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial today. Diuretics are being continued to manage fluid overload. There is a possibility of extubation in the morning if stable, with close monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pharyngeal tear: The patient has a small cuff leak when the endotracheal tube balloon is deflated, indicating a possible pharyngeal tear. This can lead to ongoing air leakage and potential infection if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's initial respiratory distress required intubation for airway protection and management of CHF. There is still a risk of recurrent respiratory distress, especially if fluid overload persists or if there are any complications related to the underlying cardiac condition.
3. Hemodynamics: The patient was previously hypotensive but is now volume overloaded. There is a risk of further hemodynamic instability if fluid balance is not carefully managed.
4. New wall motion abnormality and decreased ejection fraction: The patient has developed a new wall motion abnormality and depressed ejection fraction, indicating possible myocardial damage. This increases the risk of arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female who is critically ill with respiratory failure, resolving sepsis, and heart failure. She has been intubated for airway protection and also due to congestive heart failure. The patient has a pharyngeal tear but is stable with oxygenation and ventilation, showing no stridor or airway compromise when self-extubated. She has a cuff leak when the endotracheal tube (ETT) balloon is deflated. The patient's subcutaneous air has resolved on neck CT. She has been on diuretics and has shown improvement in her fluid overload. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, and she is off pressors. There is evidence of new wall motion abnormalities and a depressed ejection fraction, indicating a possible past cardiac event. The patient will be started on aspirin and a statin, and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be done in a couple of weeks. She also has a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) that is being treated with Zosyn. The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled, and she is on heparin drip. The plan is to restart Coumadin tomorrow if she remains stable. The patient's central venous access is through a left double-lumen midline catheter.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, who presented with septic shock and respiratory failure. She was successfully extubated today and has shown resolution of subcutaneous air and abscess, but still has residual bilateral pleural effusions. She has a recent large anterior infarct with an ejection fraction of 20-25% and is currently on various medications for her conditions, including aspirin, atorvastatin, lasix, and heparin. She also has a pacemaker and is being monitored for atrial fibrillation. The patient's anemia is suggestive of chronic disease with a component of iron deficiency, and she will be started on iron supplementation. Her current vital signs are stable, and she is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if there are complications in weaning her off mechanical ventilation or if her underlying COPD and lung cancer worsen.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and recent large anterior infarct, resulting in an ejection fraction of 20-25%. She may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: Although the patient has resolved her initial septic shock and Klebsiella UTI, there is still a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, and recent cardiac events. She presented with septic shock, respiratory failure, and clear evidence of a recent cardiac event. The patient was successfully extubated today and CT imaging showed no evidence of abscess and resolution of subcutaneous air. She has residual bilateral pleural effusions. The patient is also diagnosed with Klebsiella UTI, large anterior myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, anemia of chronic disease, and DVT. She is on various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, statins, and iron supplementation. The patient's current condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management of her multiple comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her COPD is not adequately managed or if she develops any complications such as pneumonia or exacerbations of her lung cancer.
2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's recent large anterior myocardial infarction and reduced ejection fraction, she is at risk for further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or recurrent myocardial infarction.
3. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy for DVT prophylaxis and has an INR target of 1.3"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female who was admitted with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation due to a pharyngeal tear. She is now extubated and resolving sepsis and heart failure. The main issues remaining include a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), tenacious respiratory status post-extubation with aspiration risks, systolic heart failure, new anterior wall motion abnormality, and a pharyngeal tear.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 121/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and she is in atrial fibrillation. Her weight is 74 kg, and she is 62 inches tall.

The patient has received various treatments and medications, including invasive ventilation, diuresis with Lasix, antibiotics for UTI, heparin sodium infusion, fentanyl, famotidine, and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the resolution of sepsis and heart failure.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, sodium of 139 mEq/L, chloride of 96 mEq/L, glucose of 126 mg/dL, and an albumin level of 2.8 g/dL. Other lab results are also provided.

Imaging and microbiology results are mentioned, with no new data reported.

The assessment and plan include addressing the patient's Klebsiella UTI, tenacious respiratory status post-extubation, systolic heart failure, new anterior wall motion abnormality, and pharyngeal tear. The patient will continue with aggressive chest physical therapy, encourage coughing, weaning off oxygen, and potentially using an insufflator/ex if tolerated. She will be NPO for aspiration risk pending a swallow study.

The patient's systolic heart failure will be managed with gentle diuresis (goal 500cc negative) as tolerated by blood pressure and renal function with IV Lasix daily, monitoring creatinine levels. The use of aldactone will be held.

The new anterior wall motion abnormality is likely an event that occurred in the past weeks, but no acute event based on enzymes, ECG. The patient will continue with aspirin and statin therapy, and beta-blocker/ACEI when blood pressure can tolerate. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed in 11 weeks to reassess.

The patient's pharyngeal tear is stable, and she is NPO pending a swallow evaluation. Anemia will be transfused if less than 23 g/dL. The patient's atrial fibrillation will be rate-controlled, and she"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, sepsis, and a pharyngeal tear. She is critically ill and currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been successfully extubated and is off Lasix. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 121/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a history of COPD, systolic heart failure, anemia, and a new wall motion abnormality with a depressed ejection fraction. The patient's white blood cell count is decreasing and she is afebrile. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored as she has a history of COPD and was previously intubated due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrence, especially if she develops an infection or experiences a worsening of her underlying lung disease.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's white blood cell count is decreasing and she is afebrile, there is still a risk of sepsis due to her compromised immune system and the presence of multiple comorbidities. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are essential.

3. Pharyngeal tear: The patient has a history of a pharyngeal tear, which can lead to complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and lung cancer. She presented with respiratory distress and urosepsis, now with evidence of a recent cardiac event. The patient has been experiencing pain in the right hip, which was negative on x-ray. She has been prescribed pain medication and Lasix dose has been held due to low blood pressure.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 93/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation rhythm and has diminished pulses in all extremities. Physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral lung bases, bibasilar, and rhonchorous upper airway sounds transmitted throughout. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to self.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 272 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 21.4 K/uL, platelet count of 266 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL, sodium level of 141 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.8 mEq"

","Based on the information provided, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (a fib), and lung cancer. She initially presented with urosepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has since been treated for a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) and has shown improvement. However, she now presents with respiratory distress, likely secondary to septic shock and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was successfully extubated, but a CT scan revealed no evidence of abscess and resolution of subcutaneous air. The patient still has residual bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure due to septic shock and CHF, resolution of klebsiella UTI, and a recent large anterior myocardial infarction with an estimated ejection fraction of 20-25%. The goal is to keep the patient negative 500-1L given extravascular fluid overload. However, managing her low blood pressure remains challenging.

In terms of treatment, the patient is currently receiving zosyn to complete a 10-day course for the klebsiella UTI. She is also receiving lasix 20mg IV BID, but it is being held due to hypotension.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female admitted with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation due to a pharyngeal tear. She has resolved urosepsis and heart failure. The patient has been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen. She has a history of allergies to sulfa, verapamil, and unknown allergens. The patient's medical history includes COPD, effusions, and volume overload. She also has anemia and atrial fibrillation.

24-hour events include a borderline blood pressure, holding PM lasix dose, and transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging reveals a rotated chest X-ray with right-sided pleural effusion.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main issues include systolic heart failure, volume overload, leukocytosis, Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), tenacious respiratory status, anterolateral wall motion abnormality, pharyngeal tear, anemia, and atrial fibrillation.

The plan includes continuing MDI (presumably medical management or medication), aggressive chest physical therapy, encouraging cough and weaning off oxygen. The patient is also scheduled for a swallow evaluation and barium swallow to reassess esophageal injury. Repeat TTE (transthoracic echocardi"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female who was admitted with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation due to a pharyngeal tear. She has since been extubated and is showing signs of resolving urosepsis and heart failure. The patient remains volume overloaded but intravascularly dry, and diuresis is being continued with IV lasix daily. Her leukocyte count is elevated, possibly related to high-dose steroids given two days ago versus infection or line-associated complications. A repeat chest X-ray has been ordered, and vancomycin will be added if the WBC count spikes. The patient has a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), which is being treated with a complete course of Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). Her respiratory status post-extubation is tenuous, with concerns for aspiration risks due to COPD, effusions, and volume overload. She is on MDI and aggressive chest physiotherapy, with encouragement for coughing and weaning off oxygen. NPO status is pending a swallow study. The patient also has new anterolateral wall motion abnormality, likely from a recent event in the past weeks. There are no acute changes in enzymes, ECG, or other findings. She will continue on ASA and statin, and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be done in 11 weeks to reassess. The patient had a phary"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with COPD, CAD, A fib, who initially presented with sepsis and
   respiratory failure.  Now with resolving klebsiella UTI, leukocytosis,
   and Volume overload
   # Klebsiella UTI: from cultures on [**2109-3-26**], sensitive to zosyn
   -Zosyn to complete a 10 day course currently day [**3-30**]
   # Leukocytosis: WBC count bumped to 19-22 on [**4-1**] with a left shift.
   No fevers associated with this.  She is currently being treated for a
   UTI, and recieved decadron on [**4-8**] peri-extubation.  She has no
   evidence of abscess around her hypopharyngeal tear, and blood cultures
   are with NGTD.  Her sputum shows 4+ GNR in the setting of recent
   intubation, cultures pending.  Some concern for a ventilator
   -associated PNA, however CXR's do not show consolidation.  Other
   possibility is a steroid-induced leukocytosis that is slow to resolve.
   -Will continue with zosyn for UTI, adding vancomycin and cipro if she
   spikes to cover for a ventilator-associated PNA
   -Continue to monitor WBC count and fever curve.
   # Respiratory distress
 Initial respiratory failure on admission
   resulting from septic shock with a  component of CHF.  Successfully
   extubated [**3-31**].  Now with 4+ GNR on sputum culture and ? RLL infiltrate
   and volume overload that is difficult to manage in the setting of
   transient hypotension.  Was 700cc negative for the day yesterday, and
   gets symptomatic relief with lasix.

   - ipra/alb nebs, prn alb nebs
   # CAD/Heart failure: Recent large anterior infarct, with EF 20-25%.
   Goal to keep negative 500-1L given extravascular fluid overload.
   However, difficult to manage given low BP
   -See above for management of fluid overload
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Add beta blocker once pressure stable, as cleared by speech and
   swallow.
   # A fib:  rate controlled for now.  PPM interrogated by EP, device

   -Restart BB once BP under control
   #  Anemia- retic count low, % sat <25, ferritin >400 in setting stress
   response, iron 43, all this most suggestive of chronic disease with

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, and atrial fibrillation who initially presented with sepsis and respiratory failure. She now has resolving klebsiella UTI and volume overload. The patient was successfully extubated on [**3-31**] but is experiencing ongoing respiratory distress, possibly due to aspiration or congestive heart failure. There are concerns about potential medical complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), volume overload, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum culture shows 4+ GNR, indicating a possible bacterial infection. Since she was intubated, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team plans to cover for this by adding vancomycin and ciprofloxacin if the patient spikes a fever.

2. Volume overload: The patient has been experiencing difficulty managing volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress. The healthcare team aims to keep the patient negative 500-1000cc daily with lasix gtt and monitor her fluid status closely.

3. Anemia: The patient's retic count is low, and ferritin levels are elevated in the setting of stress response. This suggests chronic disease with a component of iron deficiency. Iron supplementation may be necessary. Blood transfusion may be considered in the setting of low urine output, hypotension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, and atrial fibrillation who presented initially with sepsis and respiratory failure. She has since resolved a Klebsiella UTI and is experiencing volume overload. The patient had a recent large anterior infarct with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. She was successfully extubated but is now experiencing respiratory distress, which may be due to aspiration or congestive heart failure. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has a sputum culture showing 4+ GNR. The patient is also suffering from delirium, anemia of chronic disease, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum shows 4+ GNR, indicating a possible infection. With her recent intubation and the presence of GNR in the sputum culture, there is a concern for VAP. It is essential to monitor her closely, and if she develops symptoms such as fever or worsening respiratory distress, appropriate antibiotics should be initiated.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a hypopharyngeal tear with silent aspiration seen on gastrograffin swallow. This increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, worsening respiratory distress, and changes in oxygen saturation levels is crucial.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and a recent"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F with COPD, CAD, A fib, who initially presented with sepsis and
   respiratory failure.  Now with resolving klebsiella UTI, leukocytosis,
   and Volume overload
   # Klebsiella UTI: from cultures on [**2109-3-26**], sensitive to zosyn
   -Zosyn to complete a 10 day course currently day [**3-30**]
   # Leukocytosis: WBC count bumped to 19-22 on [**4-1**] with a left shift.
   No fevers associated with this.  She is currently being treated for a
   UTI, and recieved decadron on [**4-8**] peri-extubation.  She has no
   evidence of abscess around her hypopharyngeal tear, and blood cultures
   are with NGTD.  Her sputum shows 4+ GNR in the setting of recent
   intubation, cultures pending.  Some concern for a ventilator
   -associated PNA, however CXR's do not show consolidation.  Other
   possibility is a steroid-induced leukocytosis that is slow to resolve.
   -Will continue with zosyn for UTI, adding vancomycin and cipro if she
   spikes to cover for a ventilator-associated PNA
   -Continue to monitor WBC count and fever curve.
   # Respiratory distress
 Initial respiratory failure on admission
   resulting from septic shock with a  component of CHF.  Successfully
   extubated [**3-31**].  Now with 4+ GNR on sputum culture and ? RLL infiltrate
   and volume overload that is difficult to manage in the setting of
   transient hypotension.  Was 700cc negative for the day yesterday, and
   gets symptomatic relief with lasix.
   -Continue lasix gtt prn to keep 500-1000cc negative daily
   - ipra/alb nebs, prn alb nebs
   # CAD/Heart failure: Recent large anterior infarct, with EF 20-25%.
   Goal to keep negative 500-1L given extravascular fluid overload.
   However, difficult to manage given low BP
   -See above for management of fluid overload
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Add beta blocker once pressure stable, as cleared by speech and
   swallow.
   # A fib:  rate controlled for now.  PPM interrogated by EP, device
   working well, on heparin gtt
   -Heparin gtt for now, can restart coumadin when cleared by s&s
   -Restart BB once BP under control
   #  Anemia- retic count low, % sat <25, ferritin >400 in setting stress
   response, iron 43, all this most suggestive of chronic disease with
   component iron deficiency, would add iron supplementation. stools guiac
   negative thus far
   - Would consider blood transfusion in the setting of low UOP,
   hypotension, and CAD, should she become intravascularly depleted

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, and atrial fibrillation. She initially presented with sepsis and respiratory failure but is now resolving a klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) and has volume overload. 

The patient's recent events include being placed on fluoroscopy, EKG, and blood cultured due to an elevated white blood cell count. She received a blood transfusion and had a gastrograffin swallow that showed a hypopharyngeal tear with silent aspiration but no esophageal fistula or injury. 

The patient also experienced increasing respiratory distress, which was initially managed with nebulizers and suction. A chest X-ray showed no significant change, and the EKG revealed anterolateral ST depressions. The patient was given cardiac enzymes, restarted on lasix gtt, and showed improvement. 

The patient's delirium and pulling out of the mid-line were also documented, as well as her medical history of allergies to sulfa, verapamil, and unknown medications. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 167/125 mmHg to 130/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 80%. 

Her labs show an elevated WBC count of 26.0 K/u"

   1
","The patient is a 79-year-old female admitted with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation due to a pharyngeal tear, resolving urosepsis, and heart failure. The patient has been extubated but remains critically ill with ongoing medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Systolic heart failure: The patient remains volume overloaded but intravascularly dry, making it difficult to diurese given bilateral hypotension. Lasix with blood transfusion has been given, and restarting the Lasix drip is being considered.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be related to high-dose steroids given a few days ago or an infection.

3. Confusion and delirium: The patient is more confused and has a tendency to ""sundowning,"" which is a pattern of worsening confusion in the late afternoon or evening. This may be due to multiple factors, including the recent pharyngeal tear, aspiration risks, or underlying chronic conditions.

4. Respiratory status/hypoxia: The patient has tenuous respiratory status with ongoing hypoxia. Factors contributing to this include post-extubation complications, continued aspiration risks, COPD, effusions, and volume overload.

5. Anterior wall motion abnormality: The patient has ant wall motion abnormality, possibly indicating new demand ischemia. This warrants further investigation and management.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female who was admitted with respiratory failure due to a pharyngeal tear. She has since been extubated and is resolving urosepsis, heart failure, and delirium. 

The patient's main issues include systolic heart failure with volume overload, leukocytosis, a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), tenuous respiratory status with hypoxia, anterior wall motion abnormality possibly indicating new demand ischemia, and delirium/sundowning.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's systolic heart failure with volume overload indicates that her heart is not pumping effectively, leading to fluid accumulation in the body. If not managed properly, this can lead to further deterioration of heart function and potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.

2. Infection: The patient has an active GNR infection in her sputum culture, and there is a concern for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Inadequate treatment or failure to control the infection can lead to sepsis and septic shock.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tenuous respiratory status and hypoxia indicate ongoing difficulties with oxygenation. If not appropriately managed, this can result in further deterioration of respiratory function and potential respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F admitted with respiratory failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation c/b pharyngeal tear, now extubated, resolving urosepsis,
   and heart failure, now with delirium, leukocytosis.
   Main issues remain:
   # systolic heart failure
   Remains volume overloaded but intravascularly dry--difficult to diurese
   given b/l  hyotension
   Lasix with blood today then consider restarting lasix drip
   montioring cr/lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   Continue to hold aldactone
   # leukocytosis-? related to high dose steroids given few days ago
   peri-extubation vs infection/hap-- line, cdiff
   remains af, diff with 90% PMN, now more confused but tends to sun down
   sputum with GNR 4 + with cx pending, no new secretions or obvious
   infiltrate, without change in hd to suggest septic physiology

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of urosepsis, pharyngeal tear, and heart failure. The patient was admitted with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation but has now been extubated. The main issues remaining include systolic heart failure, leukocytosis, Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), tenacious respiratory status/hypoxia, ant wall motion abnormality, pharyngeal tear/aspiration, aspiration risks, anemia, atrial fibrillation (Afib), delirium/sundowning, and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, development of a new infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), worsening of the existing UTI, persistent hypoxia and respiratory distress, further complications related to the pharyngeal tear or aspiration, exacerbation of anemia, uncontrolled Afib leading to thromboembolic events, worsening of delirium or development of new cognitive impairments, and potential progression of ARF.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, oxygenation, and respiratory status. Frequent reassessment of the patient's mental status and neurological function is necessary to monitor for any changes in delirium or cognitive function. Regular assessment of the patient's cardiac status, including monitoring of heart rate,"
