","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, currently experiencing an acute exacerbation. She has hypercarbic respiratory failure and is on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/64 mmHg to 175/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient appears comfortable and is not in acute distress. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.34, pCO2 of 98, and pO2 of 66. Lab results indicate elevated potassium levels at 5.0 mEq/L and sodium levels at 147 mEq/L. The patient's mental status is altered but not delirious. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and current hypercarbic respiratory failure put her at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient's high blood pressure readings and the presence of a systolic murmur may indicate underlying cardiac problems, which could potentially worsen with the stress of her current condition.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The elevated levels of potassium and sodium may require close monitoring and management to avoid complications like arr"

   Worsening respiratory failure on floor.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Echo: Hyperdynamic LV with EF 75%. Unusually small LV volume. Likely
   increased LV filling pressure(PCWP>18mmHg). Minimal AS. Moderate TR.
   Severe pulmonary artery HTN, increased from prior echo.
   - TSH, folate, B12 came back within normal limits.
   - Gave patient thiamine for elevated MCV.
   - Weaned to nasal cannula during day.
   - Patient with episodes of visual/audio hallucination (seeing people
   not in the room and hearing a baby) during the afternoon and evening
   when off CPAP and on nasal cannula. ABG obtained in the morning with
   her on nasal cannula. Patient was placed back on CPAP titrated to
   mental status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a chief complaint of altered mental status (AMS) in the context of BiPAP non-compliance at home. She presented with worsening respiratory failure on the floor. 

24-hour events include:
- An echocardiogram showing hyperdynamic left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 75%. The left ventricular volume is unusually small, likely indicating increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP > 18mmHg). There is minimal aortic stenosis and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary artery hypertension has increased from the previous echo.
- Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate, and vitamin B12 levels came back within normal limits.
- Thiamine was given for elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV).
- The patient was weaned to a nasal cannula during the day.
- The patient experienced episodes of visual and auditory hallucinations during the afternoon and evening when off CPAP and on a nasal cannula. An arterial blood gas (ABG) was obtained in the morning with the patient on a nasal cannula. The patient was placed back on CPAP titrated to mental status.
- The patient had good urine output throughout the day and evening.

   with hallucination and delerium.
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contribtors include severe kyphoscoliosis resulting in severe
   restrictive physiology, severe sleep disordered breathing,
   hypoventilation syndrome, severe pHTN, chronic dHF. Gas last night when
   sleeping of NIPPV
 repeat today.
   - Work toward NC when awake and NIPPV when asleep.
   - Aim for permissive pCO2 80-90.
   - Stop Fluticasone, ipratropium
   - Continue home salmeterol and albuterol
   - No steroids at present
   - Finish course of levofloxacin given tenuous respiratory status,
   although low suspicion for PNA
   - Appears euvolemic at present but will restart home Lasix and observe
   # Delerium
   Possible contribution by metoclopramide and mild cognitive impairment,
   then respiratory failure. Other etiologies possible, but TSH, B12,
   electrolytes normal.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a chief complaint of AMS (altered mental status) in the context of BiPAP non-compliance at home. She has been experiencing worsening respiratory failure on the floor. Her 24-hour events include an echo showing hyperdynamic LV (left ventricle) with EF (ejection fraction) 75%, unusually small LV volume, likely increased LV filling pressure (PCWP > 18mmHg), minimal AS (aortic stenosis), moderate TR (tricuspid regurgitation), and severe pulmonary artery hypertension, which has increased from the prior echo. Her TSH, folate, and B12 levels are within normal limits, and she was given thiamine for elevated MCV (mean corpuscular volume). She was weaned to a nasal cannula during the day and experienced episodes of visual/audio hallucinations when off CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) and on a nasal cannula. An ABG (arterial blood gas) was obtained in the morning with her on a nasal cannula, and she was placed back on CPAP titrated to mental status. The patient had good urine output throughout the day and evening.

Other notable findings include:
- No known drug allergies
- Infusions and other ICU medications are mentioned
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below
- Vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), presenting with acute exacerbation of COPD, hypoxemia, hypernatremia, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show signs of respiratory distress with a SpO2 of 90%. The patient has been weaned to a nasal cannula from CPAP and has episodes of visual and audio hallucinations. The patient's laboratory results indicate mild anemia and leukocytosis with a slightly elevated creatinine level. The patient has been on ICU care, including prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's current disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's SpO2 level of 90% indicates hypoxemia, which can lead to respiratory failure if not promptly addressed.
2. Delirium: The patient's episodes of visual and audio hallucinations suggest altered mental status, which may be indicative of delirium. Delirium can worsen outcomes in critically ill patients.
3. Infection: The pending MRSA screen and blood culture suggest a possible infection. Infections in critically ill patients can quickly become life-threatening.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The negative fluid balance indicates that the patient is losing more fluids than they are receiving. This imbalance can lead to dehydration and electrolyte"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to kyphoscoliosis. She presented with increasing confusion at home and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of her condition. She is also suffering from hypoxemia and hypernatremia (high sodium levels), as well as altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 153/76 mmHg to 119/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 101, and pO2 of 50-46 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin build, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally, soft non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and no lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and appears slightly confused.

Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 151 K/uL, slightly low platelet count of 196 K/uL, and elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Plan:
The patient will continue with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to manage her hypercarbic respiratory failure. Antibiotics have been prescribed for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The plan is to transition the patient to the medical floor and consider discharge once she is stable. Due to her delirium, the medication Reglan has been discontinued. The ICU team will continue to monitor and manage her care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with hypercarbic respiratory failure caused by severe kyphoscoliosis. Her condition initially improved after receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV), but she is now experiencing hallucinations and delirium. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 to 168/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 326 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 30%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 102 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 35 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 49 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -17 mg/dL. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 187 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 36.8%, and normal platelet count (Plt) of 196 K/uL. Her blood glucose level is within normal range at 98 mg/dL"

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of severe kyphoscoliosis. Her condition initially improved after a night on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), but she is now experiencing hallucinations and delirium.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 to 168/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on bipap mask with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient has been receiving various medications including Lasix, metaclopramide (which has been discontinued), levofloxacin, and heparin sodium. Her allergies include no known drug allergies.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvement in mental status after stopping metaclopramide.

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has been receiving fluids through IVF and has had a total output of 1,755 mL of urine. Her respiratory support includes the use of a bipap mask with CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 326 mL, PS of 20 cmH2O, RR of 23 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and PIP of 27 cmH2O. Her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory failure. She experienced an episode of desaturation with oxygen levels in the 30s, which spontaneously resolved after restarting non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). She is currently off NIPPV on nasal cannula and doing well. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the episode mentioned above.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has chronic COPD with acute exacerbation, hypoxemia, hypernatremia (high sodium), and altered mental status. She is being treated with NIPPV and Levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The plan is to maintain her on nasal cannula during the day with the goal of achieving oxygen saturation in the low 90s.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and acute exacerbation put her at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged use of NIPPV increases the risk of developing VAP. Frequent assessment of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered if necessary.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability due to acute illness increase the risk of DVT."
