   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have developed
   aspiration pneumonia in the setting of nasuea and vomiting.  Underlying
   lung function not entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and
   that she is s/p lobectomy.  Also consistent with influenze given
   weakness, n/v, and cough.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 7-10 days
   - FU urine legionella
   - Continue tamiflu pending influenza swab
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send sputum culture
   # Hypotension:  Close to baseline, but likely worse [**2-16**] dehydration +/-
   sepsis.  She is currently dehydrated on exam and labs are c/w
   hemoconcentration.
   - volume resuscitation using HR, Uop to titrate fluids
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), increased intracranial pressure (especially given
   possible cerebellar findings on exam and h/o lung cancer), or
   pancreatitis.  Cardiac ischemia can also present with nausea, although
   EKG is reassuring.  Could also be influenza as above.
   - FU head CT read
   - if head CT is negative, MRI with contrast as outpatient
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - follow serial cardiac biomarkers, will get one more set this
   afternoon
   - Add stool studies
   - zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   near baseline with IVF overnight, likely was secondary to dehydration
   and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated, on admission,
   now with significant hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional.
   Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Check pm Hct

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recent lobectomy. She presented with shortness of breath and cough, which are likely due to aspiration pneumonia. Other possible causes include underlying lung function abnormalities, emphysema, and influenza.

The patient has been started on antibiotics (ceftriaxone and levofloxacin) for pneumonia, and Tamiflu is being continued pending influenza swab results. Nebulizers with Atrovent and albuterol are given as needed for respiratory symptoms. Sputum culture has also been sent.

The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to dehydration and possible sepsis. Volume resuscitation using hemodynamic monitoring and urine output titration is ongoing.

Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea could be due to various causes such as viral gastroenteritis, increased intracranial pressure, pancreatitis, or cardiac ischemia. Further investigations like head CT, MRI, lipase and amylase levels, cardiac biomarkers, and stool studies are planned.

Acute renal failure was likely secondary to dehydration and hypotension, but has resolved with intravenous fluids. Renal function should be closely monitored, and precautions should be taken to avoid renally toxic medications.

The patient has developed anemia with a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration from"

   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nasuea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy.  Less likely influenza given negative flu swab.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 7-10 days  (today is
   day 3 of 7)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have alerted oncologists regarding appoprioate
   follow-up
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam but has been volume resuscitated.  Now BP
   increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Will hold off on further IVF for now and encourage PO intake but can
   supplement with IVF prn
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion.  Increased intracranial pressure less likely
   given normal CT.  Cardiac ischemia can also present with nausea,
   although EKG is reassuring and cardiac biomarkers negative.
   Pancreatitis not likely due to normal amylase and lipase.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - Add stool studies if develops diarrhea
   - zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated, on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now near baseline
   and stable.  Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor daily Hct
   # Lung Cancer s/p lobectomy:
   - have contact[**Name (NI) **] oncology providers to make them aware of admission,
   are following

","The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with likely aspiration pneumonia. She is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

Summary of Progress:
- The patient's shortness of breath and cough are likely due to pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia given her recent lobectomy and underlying lung function.
- Initial treatment includes ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 7-10 days.
- Urine legionella antigen is negative, and tamiflu and respiratory precautions have been stopped.
- Additional sputum culture has been sent.
- Follow-up is needed to exclude malignancy and ensure resolution of CT chest findings.
- Hypotension was at baseline, possibly due to dehydration, but has improved with volume resuscitation.
- Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea may be viral gastroenteritis or food poisoning, less likely influenza or increased intracranial pressure.
- Cardiac ischemia is unlikely given normal EKG and negative cardiac biomarkers.
- Pancreatitis is not likely due to normal amylase and lipase levels.
- Acute renal failure was secondary to dehydration and hypotension, which has resolved with IVF.
- Anemia is likely hemoconcentrated or dilutional and is near baseline and stable.
- The patient's lung cancer status post lobectomy needs to be monitored, and oncology providers have been contacted.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with
   likely aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nausea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy.  Less likely influenza given negative flu swab.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 10 days  (today is day
   4 of 10)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have alerted oncologists regarding appropriate
   follow-up
   # Atrial flutter: Has history of pAfib in the past, but has not
   required beta blockers for quite some time.  Feel likely related to new
   lung pathology.  Given 5mg IV metoprolol x2 over last 24 hours with
   good effect.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg po TID
   - Will repeat IV dosing as needed for rate control
   - Can consider cardioversion in this patient when rate controlled
   - Need to address issue of anticoagulation: CHADS2 score is 0, but
   likely should be taking aspirin daily
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam on admission but has been volume
   resuscitated.  Now BP increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Encourage PO intake
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion although this likely due to timecourse.
   Increased intracranial pressure less likely given normal CT.  Cardiac
   ischemia can also present with nausea, although EKG is reassuring and
   cardiac biomarkers negative.  Pancreatitis not likely due to normal
   amylase and lipase.  Still having some diarrhea.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to outpatient
   oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - FU C diff for diarrhea
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now stable
   between 27 and 30.  Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Guaiac all stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath and cough. She has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and underwent a lobectomy. The patient presented with likely aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by her symptoms, CT findings, and history of cough and weakness. She is currently on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for pneumonia, and Atrovent and albuterol nebs are given as needed. 

The patient also has atrial flutter with variable rate and conduction, which is likely related to new lung pathology. She received IV metoprolol with good effect, and her heart rate was controlled. The plan is to continue metoprolol 25mg po TID and repeat IV dosing as needed for rate control. Cardioversion may be considered when the rate is controlled, and the patient should be started on aspirin daily.

The patient experienced hypotension, likely secondary to dehydration and worsened by her baseline condition. She has been volume resuscitated and is now stable with improved blood pressure. Encouraging oral intake is recommended.

The patient also presented with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which could be due to viral gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Other causes such as increased intracranial pressure, cardiac ischemia, and pancreatitis are less likely. An MRI with contrast as an outpatient is considered, and FU C diff is ordered"

   Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath
   24 Hour Events:
   - HR to 140s in am rounds, appeared to be atrial flutter with variable
   conduction, gave 1L NS which failed to bring down heart rate so started
   Metoprolol 12.5 po TID which was later increased to 25mg po TID for
   Aflutter with RVR
   - In evening, HR up to 170 while patient attempting to get up for
   bathroom unsupervised, settled back into bed and given 5 mg IV
   metoprolol with HR down to 90s following.  Multiple episodes of
   transient increased to HR of 160s afterwards. Got another IV 5mg X1,
   got 25mg m/n dose at 10pm, and put in for CXR given poor airway
   movement.  Showed worsened RML/RLL consolidation, ?on LLL too.  Asked
   for acapella valve, incentive spirometer sputum sample.
   - This morning, she reports feeling slightly better every day, able to
   talk in complete sentences.  She slept through the night, had one

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with likely aspiration pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable. The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and weakness. She has a history of emphysema and has undergone a lobectomy. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on aerosol-cool. The patient's physical examination reveals tachypneic breathing, increased work of breathing, and rhonchi bilaterally across lung fields. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly. She has no calf pain or edema but does have 1+ dependent edema. Laboratory results show normal WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows worsened right middle lobe and right lower lobe consolidation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT findings and history of cough and weakness. Continue ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 10 days. Atrovent and albuterol nebs as needed. Send additional sputum culture. Follow-up"
