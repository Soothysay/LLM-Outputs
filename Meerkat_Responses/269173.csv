","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient required intubation and invasive ventilation. 

On the first day, the patient was started on Clindamycin, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. However, the sputum gram stain did not show any microorganisms, so the antibiotics were adjusted to include better anaerobic coverage. 

The patient also had leukocytosis with a left shift, which suggests a bacterial infection. A bronchoscopy was performed, revealing a large mucus plug but no endobronchial lesion. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples were sent for microbiological and cytological analysis. 

The patient's imaging showed extensive consolidation and collapse of the right middle lobe and lower lobe, small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion with enhancing pleura concerning for possible empyema, small left pleural effusion, extensive emphysematous changes, and 4-7 mm lung nodules in the left lung base. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 158/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 211 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, slightly low sodium level of 23 mEq/L, normal potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, and elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range, and the imaging shows extensive emphysematous changes. 

The patient's medical complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events (VAEs), and possible empyema due to the presence of a pleural effusion. The patient's impaired skin integrity may be related to immobility or pressure ulcers caused by prolonged bed rest. 

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory distress, potential pneumonia, and other associated complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and small cell carcinoma of the lungs (SCCa), for which they underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 

The patient was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to acute respiratory failure caused by pneumonia (PNA). They were started on invasive ventilation and received broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.

On review of the patient's vital signs, they have a slightly elevated heart rate (tachycardia) and stable blood pressure. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and the oxygen saturation is at 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal limits. Troponin-T levels are normal, indicating no signs of cardiac damage. 

The imaging report from last night shows an endotracheal tube in place, with no significant changes. The sputum culture is pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, presence of thick, dark yellow secretions, and no signs of cyanosis, clubbing, muscle wasting, or jaundice. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal tone.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of malignant neoplasm, lung, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), presenting to the ICU with fever, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. The patient has impaired skin integrity and evidence of pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Blood cultures were sent, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 101°F, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure fluctuating between 135/59 mmHg and 88/50 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest a potential infection leading to sepsis. Immediate management should focus on identifying the causative organism and initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange, there is a risk of developing ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia, and the source control measures, such as bronchoscopy, should be considered to address any airway obstruction or fluid accumulation.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism"

   PNA presenting with a large (complex appearing) RLL consolidation,
   leukocytosis w/ left shift, and respiratory distress requiring
   intubation, all of which suggest a significant RLL pneumonia.
   .
   #  PNEUMONIA: Large RLL consolidation, white count, and increasing O2
   requirement all c/w PNA. Not displaying septic physiology currently
   although UOP on the lower end of normal. Surprising that she did not
   present sooner given magnitude of PNA.
   - Will d/w radiology whether there is a cavitary component to her PNA
   which would necessitate vanco & anaerobic covg, otherwise will be
   continue with CTX/azithro.
   - fluid resuiscitation with goal UOP >60/hr
   - f/u BCX, SPUTUM CX (endotracheal)

   - Call IR [**8-14**] to see if air fluid level in lungs can be drained
   .
   #  RESP DISTRESS: Serial CXRs done in ED show some improvement in
   intersitial opacification (primarily RUL). This quick reversibilty and
   her reported improvement to Lasix at OSH ED suggest that there may be
   some component of fluid overload. That said, no documented hx of CHF
   here and otherwise dry on exam.  Interstitial pattern could be
   secondary to increased permeability in setting of infxn. No plan to
   wean from vent currently as early in the course of treatment of PNA and
   suspect that she would develop the significant dyspnea she had this AM.
   Doing well on [**10-30**] with FiO2 of 40%. Will complete ROMI given sudden
   onset of SOB which awoke her from sleep.
   .
   #  LEUKOCYTOSIS: As above, most likely secondary to process in lung
   although will get LFTs and UCx to evaluate for other causes.
   .
   # ARF: Cr at 1.5 from baseline of 1.0. Likely intravascular depletion
   in the setting of third spacing from significant infection. Will trend

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presenting with respiratory distress, leukocytosis, and a large right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were sent, and she was given Tylenol for fever. IV fluids were administered as well.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/59 mmHg to 159/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, and pneumonia. The pneumonia is suspected to be caused by a significant right lower lobe infection. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated with a left shift, indicating a possible bacterial infection.

The patient's arterial blood gases (ABG) are not mentioned in the progress note. Her urine output is on the lower end of normal, and she requires supplemental oxygen.

The plan includes obtaining radiology results to determine if there is a cavitary component to the pneumonia, which would necessitate vancomycin and anaerobic coverage. Otherwise,"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 67 F with a history of SCLC and previous
   PNA presenting with a large (complex appearing) RLL consolidation,
   leukocytosis w/ left shift, and respiratory distress requiring
   intubation, all of which suggest a significant RLL pneumonia.
   #  PNEUMONIA: Large RLL consolidation, white count, and increasing O2
   requirement all c/w PNA. Not displaying septic physiology currently
   although UOP on the lower end of normal. Surprising that she did not
   present sooner given magnitude of PNA.
   - Will d/w radiology whether there is a cavitary component to her PNA
   which would necessitate vanco & anaerobic covg, otherwise will be
   continue with CTX/azithro.
   - fluid resuiscitation with goal UOP >60/hr
   - f/u BCX, SPUTUM CX (endotracheal)
   - Heme/Onc records from OSH needed (please obtain [**8-14**])
   - Call IR [**8-14**] to see if air fluid level in lungs can be drained
   #  RESP DISTRESS: Serial CXRs done in ED show some improvement in
   intersitial opacification (primarily RUL). This quick reversibilty and
   her reported improvement to Lasix at OSH ED suggest that there may be
   some component of fluid overload. That said, no documented hx of CHF
   here and otherwise dry on exam.  Interstitial pattern could be
   secondary to increased permeability in setting of infxn. No plan to
   wean from vent currently as early in the course of treatment of PNA and
   suspect that she would develop the significant dyspnea she had this AM.
   Doing well on [**10-30**] with FiO2 of 40%. Will complete ROMI given sudden
   onset of SOB which awoke her from sleep.
   #  LEUKOCYTOSIS: As above, most likely secondary to process in lung
   although will get LFTs and UCx to evaluate for other causes.
   # ARF: Cr at 1.5 from baseline of 1.0. Likely intravascular depletion
   in the setting of third spacing from significant infection. Will trend

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- She presented with respiratory distress, leukocytosis, and a large right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, suggesting significant RLL pneumonia.
- The patient was intubated and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin).
- Fluid resuscitation was initiated due to concern for intravascular depletion.
- The patient's condition improved, but she remains on mechanical ventilation.
- There is a concern for potential complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- Further workup is needed, including obtaining Heme/Onc records from OSH and calling IR to explore the possibility of draining an air-fluid level in the lungs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's presentation with pneumonia and leukocytosis, there is a risk of developing sepsis if the infection spreads throughout the body.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's respiratory distress and worsening oxygen requirements indicate the possibility of ARF, which may necessitate further intervention.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization due to mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing D"

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with respiratory distress, leukocytosis with a left shift, and a large right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, suggesting significant RLL pneumonia. The patient was intubated and placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics including clindamycin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. Azithromycin was also added. Blood cultures were drawn, and a bronchoscopy was performed. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/59 mmHg to 159/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.0 mg/dL. There is evidence of intravascular depletion, and the patient is receiving intravenous fluids for repletion. Electrolytes are being trended and replenished as needed. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and previous pneumonia (PNA) who presented with respiratory distress, leukocytosis, and a large right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, suggesting significant RLL pneumonia. She was intubated and admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. Cultures have been sent, including blood, urine, sputum, and stool. She is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics (CTX, azithro), and midazolam/fentanyl for sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including the large RLL consolidation and leukocytosis, indicate a significant pneumonia. It is important to monitor her response to antibiotics and continue with appropriate coverage based on culture results.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress, which necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. It is crucial to closely monitor her oxygenation and ventilation parameters and adjust ventilator settings as needed.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.3, suggesting acute kidney injury. This could be due to intravascular depletion and third spacing from significant infection. Close monitoring of renal function and aggressive fluid resuscitation are necessary.

4. Leukocytosis"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and previous pneumonia, presenting with symptoms including a large right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, leukocytosis with a left shift, and respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient was given antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, but sputum cultures did not grow any microorganisms. The patient's condition improved, and they were successfully extubated. However, the patient still has fluid overload and high blood pressure and heart rate, so the intravenous fluids were stopped, and home Lasix was restarted. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and they are on alprazolam and pail for mental status changes. The patient also has hypertension and leukocytosis, which is most likely secondary to the lung process. The patient's creatinine level is elevated from a baseline of 1.0 to 1.5, but it resolved with previous fluid administration. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending discussion with a healthcare proxy and possible transfer to another location for continued care."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and previous pneumonia (PNA).
- He presented with respiratory distress, leukocytosis with a left shift, and a large right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, suggesting significant RLL pneumonia.
- The patient was intubated and started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and clindamycin.
- His condition improved, and he was extubated yesterday.
- The patient has a history of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia.
- He has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) in the lung and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation.
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/51 mmHg to 170/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and oriented to person only.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, and troponin-T level.
- The chest X-ray indicates worsening pulmonary edema superimposed on emphysema,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and previous pneumonia. She presented with respiratory distress and was intubated. She has leukocytosis, a large right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, and increasing oxygen requirement, suggesting significant RLL pneumonia. She was on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, clindamycin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. Her vital signs are stable, and she is extubated. However, she has worsening pulmonary edema superimposed on emphysema with new retrocardiac opacity possibly representing consolidation, worsening atelectasis, and/or effusion. She also has impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, and dementia. She is being treated with Lasix, alprazolam, and continues with CTX/azithro. Further investigations and discussions are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has signs and symptoms consistent with pneumonia, including a large RLL consolidation, leukocytosis, and increased oxygen requirement.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially developed respiratory distress in the ER and required intubation. She has been extubated but needs close monitoring.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has poor skin integrity, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.
