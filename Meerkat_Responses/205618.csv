","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old nursing home resident admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis. The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, altered mental status, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and a history of subdural hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumosepsis: The patient's nursing home pneumonia has progressed to likely pneumosepsis, which is a severe infection requiring immediate medical attention.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. There may be difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to underlying chronic conditions.
3. Left-Sided Weakness: The patient presents with new left-sided weakness, which could be due to a central nervous system lesion. Further evaluation and assessment are needed to determine the cause.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, characterized by an increase in serum creatinine from 0.6 to 1.1. This may require renal replacement therapy or dialysis.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a high sodium level of 149. This can lead to severe dehydration and neurological complications if not corrected promptly.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may indicate delirium, which is common in elderly patients with infections or acute illnesses.

The patient is a 76-year-old male with septic shock from left lower lobe pneumonia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of dysphagia, placing him at risk for aspiration. He has been started on levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for antibiotic coverage.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/58 mmHg to 123/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is within the target range of 8-12 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 161 K/uL and elevated lactate levels. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but his creatinine (Cr) level has improved from 1.7 to 1.2 after fluid administration.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76M nursing home resident with a LLL pneumonia and
   hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
   #. Pneumosepsis: LLL pneumonia in a nursing home patient, with SIRS
   criteria, and lactate of 7.4.  Lactate down to 2.3 in the ICU after 6L
   NS in ED. Also, known to have dysphagia so at risk for aspiration. Had
   started levofloxacin 1 day prior to admission.   Has some more sputums
   as of [**2157-3-18**].
   -Cont levo (day 3); vanco and zosyn (day 2)
   - consider monotherapy with zosyn if MRSA negative and clinically
   improves, though patient
s risk factors (Nursing home, multiple
   pneumonias, possible treatment failure)
   -f/u  blood cultures and urine cultures.
   - monitor CVP, UOP and bolus with NS PRN
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated for tachypnea and concern for tiring
   though no abnormal ABG data at time of intubation.  Has done well on PS
   over the past 24 hours and will attempt trial of spontaneous breathing.
   - SBT
   -conservator seems to think short term intubation in line with pt's
   wishes for now but pt is DNR
   - decrease fent/versed gtts for sedation
   #. Left hemiparesis:  Communicated with nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 213**] on [**3-18**]
   and she confirms that patient has had left hemiparesis x 4 years.
   - continue to follow
   #. ARF- Cr on arrival 1.7 down to 1.1 this am. Most likely prerenal.
   Baseline Cr last time here in [**2152**] was 0.6.  '
   -Trend Cr.
   -IVF to maintain UOP >50cc/hr
   -f/u urine lytes
   #. DM - On novolin sliding scale, metformin and lantus at NH. Will hold
   on metformin for now given ARF but continue insulin
   # h/o SDH- cont home keppra. Per CT in ED, stable now.
   # HTN- Will hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now with borderline low
   BP.
   FEN: NPO for now. Nutrition consulted for TF recs

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old nursing home resident with left lower lobe pneumonia and hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis. The patient has a history of dysphagia, putting him at risk for aspiration. He was started on levofloxacin one day prior to admission.

Assessment and plan:
1. Pneumosepsis: The patient's LLL pneumonia, along with SIRS criteria and elevated lactate levels, suggests pneumosepsis. Lactate has decreased from 7.4 in the emergency department to 2.3 in the ICU after receiving 6 liters of normal saline. The patient is being treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). If MRSA is negative and the patient clinically improves, monotherapy with Zosyn may be considered. Blood cultures and urine cultures should be followed up, and central venous pressure (CVP), urine output (UOP), and fluid resuscitation with normal saline (NS) as needed should be monitored.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for tachypnea and concern for respiratory failure. However, no abnormal arterial blood gas (ABG) data were noted at the time of intubation. The patient has done well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) over the past 24 hours, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SB"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes, ventricular ependymoma, and dementia who presented with septic shock from left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient underwent a craniotomy, suffered a subdural hematoma, and is now experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypernatremia. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory support is set to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.8°F (38.8°C), heart rate between 79-108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 to 120/64 mmHg, respiratory rate between 24-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. Other lab values such as creatinine, bilirubin, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male nursing home resident with a diagnosis of pneumonia who was admitted to the ICU due to hemodynamic instability and suspected pneumosepsis. The patient's medical history includes altered mental status, left hemiparesis, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

The patient's current conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, hypernatremia (high sodium), and possible delirium. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which indicates severe respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been obtained, and the patient's sputum and mini-BAL cultures are negative for growth.

The patient's renal function has improved from an initial creatinine level of 1.7 to 0.9. The patient's glucose levels have been monitored and managed with insulin.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the guardian is in agreement with temporary intubation and the use of pressors. The emergency contact information is provided.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening sepsis leading to organ dysfunction, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration in renal"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old nursing home resident with a diagnosis of pneumonia and suspected sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, altered mental status, and hypernatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Pneumosepsis: The patient has a history of LLL pneumonia and is likely experiencing sepsis due to the presence of SIRS criteria and elevated lactate levels. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of deterioration and ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires intubation and mechanical ventilation support. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated events. Regular assessment of respiratory function and weaning trials should be conducted to minimize the duration of mechanical ventilation.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's dysphagia, there is a risk of aspiration, leading to aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and early identification of any changes in mental status or swallowing ability are essential.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.6, which has increased to 1.1. It is important to monitor renal function closely and adjust fluid management accordingly. Potential causes of AKI include sepsis, dehydration, or pre-existing chronic kidney disease.
5. Delirium: The patient presents with altered mental"

   to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
   #. Pneumosepsis: LLL pneumonia in a nursing home patient, with SIRS
   criteria, and lactate of 7.4 on admission.  Lactate down to 2.3 in the
   ICU after 6L NS in ED. Also, known to have dysphagia so at risk for
   aspiration. Had started levofloxacin 1 day prior to admission.   So far
   both sputum and mini BAL without growth
   -Cont levo (day 5); vanco and zosyn (day 4)
   - Pt MRSA negative so will consider d/c vanco if appears to be
   clinically improving.
   -f/u  blood cultures and urine cultures.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated for tachypnea and concern for tiring
   though no abnormal ABG data at time of intubation.  Developed tachypnea
   this am on SBT. Put  back on a/c
   - trial of PS this afternoon as tolerated
   -conservator seems to think short term intubation in line with pt's
   wishes for now but pt is [**Name (NI) **] will talk to her today

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**], a 76-year-old nursing home resident, was admitted to the ICU with hemodynamic instability and suspected pneumosepsis secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has a history of dysphagia, which puts him at risk for aspiration. He has been receiving levofloxacin since the day before admission. Initial sputum and mini-balloon aspiration without growth were observed. Currently, the patient is intubated due to respiratory failure and tachypnea. His blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. The patient also has a pre-existing left hemiparesis, acute renal failure (ARF) with improved creatinine levels from 1.7 to 0.9, and diabetes mellitus (DM). His subdural hematoma (SDH) is stable. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is on temporary intubation and pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumosepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing further complications due to his underlying pneumonia and suspected sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and response to antibiotics is crucial.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition requires close monitoring. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to his tachypnea and risk of aspiration. Frequent assessments of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76M nursing home resident with a LLL pneumonia who came
   to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
   #. Pneumosepsis: LLL pneumonia in a nursing home patient, with SIRS
   criteria, and lactate of 7.4 on admission.  Lactate down to 2.3 in the
   ICU after 6L NS in ED. Also, known to have dysphagia so at risk for
   aspiration. Had started levofloxacin 1 day prior to admission.   So far
   both sputum and mini BAL without growth
   -Cont levo (day 6); vanco and zosyn (day 5)
   - Pt MRSA negative so will consider d/c vanco if appears to be
   clinically improving.
   - f/u  blood cultures and urine cultures.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated for tachypnea and concern for tiring
   though no abnormal ABG data at time of intubation.  Developed tachypnea
   on [**3-20**] on SBT and put back on AC.  Anxiety likely plays a large
   component, as patient hyperventilates when anxious.  [**Month (only) 60**] do well if
   simply extubated.
   - bronch to remove any remaining secretions prior to extubation
   - will decrease PS and attempt to extubate
   - holding haldol/seroquel for now
   - speak to guardian about patient
s preferences re: re-intubation
   should he fail extubation
   #. Left hemiparesis:  Communicated with nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 213**] on [**3-18**]
   and she confirms that patient has had left hemiparesis x 4 years.
   - continue to follow
   #. ARF- Cr on arrival 1.7 down to 0.9 this am. Most likely prerenal.
   Baseline Cr last time here in [**2152**] was 0.6.
   -Trend Cr., monitor UOP
   #. DM - On novolin sliding scale, metformin and lantus at NH. Will hold
   on metformin for now given ARF but continue insulin
   # h/o SDH- cont home keppra. Per CT in ED, stable now.
   # HTN- Will hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now with borderline low
   BP.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76-year-old nursing home resident admitted to the ICU with a left-lower lobe pneumonia and hemodynamic instability, likely due to sepsis. The patient has several medical complications and conditions:

1. Pneumosepsis: The patient has a confirmed or suspected severe infection in the lungs leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and an elevated lactate level. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the patient's sputum and mini-balloon aspiration lavage (mini BAL) cultures were negative. The antibiotic regimen includes levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Vancomycin may be discontinued if the patient shows clinical improvement and is MRSA-negative.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to tachypnea and concern for respiratory muscle fatigue. Although no abnormal arterial blood gas (ABG) data were present at the time of intubation, the patient developed tachypnea during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was placed back on assisted ventilation. Anxiety is suspected as a contributing factor to the tachypnea. The plan is to decrease the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and attempt extubation. Bronchial suctioning will be performed before extubation to remove any remaining secretions.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes, ventricular ependymoma status post craniotomy, subdural hematoma, and dementia. He presented to the hospital with septic shock from left lower lobe pneumonia. 

On current assessment, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 88/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, with total input and output balance indicating a negative fluid balance. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 210 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 157 to 122 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 122 mg/dL. Other lab values include a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 2.9 mg/dL, and platelet count of 175 K/uL.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient has LLL pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. Follow-up cultures are pending.
2. Hemodynamics: The patient is off of pressors and is receiving IV fluids as needed.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated due to previous pneumonia and failed a spontaneous breathing trial today. He will be reassessed tomorrow.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal failure has resolved, and his creatinine levels are stable.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved.
6. Nutrition: The patient has started tube feeding (TF).
7. Other issues are mentioned in the resident's note.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he fails another spontaneous breathing trial or if there is a recurrence of infection.
2. Sepsis/pneumonia: There is a risk of worsening sepsis or pneumonia if the patient's infection does not respond to the current antibiotic regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, ventricular ependymoma, and previous craniotomy for subdural hematoma. He presented with septic shock secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure caused by the pneumonia. His renal function has improved, and hypernatremia has resolved. The patient continues to be on antibiotics, vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin. Vital signs are stable, but the patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe pneumonia and is currently on appropriate antibiotics. However, there is a risk of worsening sepsis or development of antibiotic resistance.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events (VAEs), and barotrauma.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Although the patient's renal function has improved, there is still a risk of further deterioration due to hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.
4. Hypernatremia: Although the patient's hypernatremia has resolved, there is still a risk of electrolyte imbalances due to fluid administration or renal dysfunction.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 .H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76M nursing home resident with a LLL pneumonia who came
   to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
   #. Pneumosepsis: LLL pneumonia in a nursing home patient, with SIRS
   criteria, and lactate of 7.4 on admission.  Lactate down to 2.3 in the
   ICU after 6L NS in ED. Also, known to have dysphagia so at risk for
   aspiration. Had started levofloxacin 1 day prior to admission.   So far
   both sputum and mini BAL without growth
   -Cont levo (day 6); vanco and zosyn (day 5)
   - Pt MRSA negative so will consider d/c vanco if appears to be
   clinically improving.
   - f/u  blood cultures and urine cultures.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated for tachypnea and concern for tiring
   though no abnormal ABG data at time of intubation.  Developed tachypnea
   on [**3-20**] on SBT and put back on AC.  Anxiety likely plays a large
   component, as patient hyperventilates when anxious.  [**Month (only) 60**] do well if
   simply extubated.
   - bronch to remove any remaining secretions prior to extubation
   - will decrease PS and attempt to extubate
   - holding haldol/seroquel for now
   - speak to guardian about patient
s preferences re: re-intubation
   should he fail extubation
   #. Left hemiparesis:  Communicated with nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 213**] on [**3-18**]
   and she confirms that patient has had left hemiparesis x 4 years.
   - continue to follow
   #. ARF- Cr on arrival 1.7 down to 0.9 this am. Most likely prerenal.
   Baseline Cr last time here in [**2152**] was 0.6.
   -Trend Cr., monitor UOP
   #. DM - On novolin sliding scale, metformin and lantus at NH. Will hold
   on metformin for now given ARF but continue insulin
   # h/o SDH- cont home keppra. Per CT in ED, stable now.
   # HTN- Will hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now with borderline low
   BP.
   FEN: cont TF but hold after midnight in anticipation of extubation
   PPX: PPI
   ACCESS: RIJ, R A line

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 76-year-old nursing home resident with lower left lobe pneumonia.
- Admitted to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
- Initially treated with levofloxacin, then vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
- Intubated for respiratory failure due to tachypnea and concern for fatigue.
- Developed tachypnea on [3-20] and put back on assisted ventilation.
- Anxiety likely contributes to hyperventilation.
- Bronchoscopy to remove secretions prior to extubation.
- Plan to decrease positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and attempt extubation.
- Holding off on midazolam and fentanyl infusions.
- Consultation with family regarding patient preferences for re-intubation.
- Left hemiparesis confirmed by nurse, present for 4 years.
- Acute renal failure with improvement in creatinine level from 1.7 to 0.9.
- Most likely prerenal.
- DM controlled with insulin sliding scale, metformin, and lantus.
- SDH stable, on keppra at home.
- HTN on hold due to low blood pressure.
- DNR code status.
- Emergency contact information provided.

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 .H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76M nursing home resident with a LLL pneumonia who came
   to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
   #. Pneumosepsis: LLL pneumonia in a nursing home patient, with SIRS
   criteria, and lactate of 7.4 on admission.  Lactate down to 2.3 in the
   ICU after 6L NS in ED. Also, known to have dysphagia so at risk for
   aspiration. Had started levofloxacin 1 day prior to admission.   So far
   both sputum and mini BAL without growth
   -Cont levo (day 7); vanco and zosyn (day 6)
   - Pt MRSA negative so will consider d/c vanco if appears to be
   clinically improving.
   - f/u  blood cultures and urine cultures.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated for tachypnea and concern for tiring
   though no abnormal ABG data at time of intubation.  Developed tachypnea
   on [**3-20**] on SBT and put back on AC.  Anxiety likely plays a large
   component, as patient hyperventilates when anxious.  [**Month (only) 60**] do well if
   simply extubated.
   - will decrease PS today if possible
   - holding haldol/seroquel for now
   - speak to guardian about patient
s preferences re: re-intubation
   should he fail extubation
   -Lasix IV today to attempt to get -1L.  then check PM lytes
   -after optimization, will attempt extubation possibly tomorrow.
   #. Left hemiparesis:  Communicated with nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 213**] on [**3-18**]
   and she confirms that patient has had left hemiparesis x 4 years.
   - continue to follow
   #. ARF- Cr on arrival 1.7 down to 0.9 this am. Most likely prerenal.
   Baseline Cr last time here in [**2152**] was 0.6.
   -Trend Cr., monitor UOP
   #. DM - On novolin sliding scale, metformin and lantus at NH. Will hold
   on metformin for now given ARF but continue insulin
   # h/o SDH- cont home keppra. Per CT in ED, stable now.
   # HTN- Will hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now with borderline low
   BP.
   FEN: cont TF but hold after midnight in anticipation of extubation

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, ventricular ependymoma status post craniotomy, subdural hematoma, and dementia. He presented to the hospital with severe septic shock secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia. 

The patient's current condition is respiratory failure due to persistent thick secretions and worsening lung opacities on chest X-ray. He is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin. The plan is to continue aggressive suctioning and reevaluate for extubation tomorrow. Diuretics may be considered if effusions persist. The family prefers reintubation only if new therapeutic options are identified, otherwise do not intubate (DNI).

Sepsis and hypotension related to pneumonia have resolved, and the patient is off pressors. Acute renal failure has also resolved. Hypernatremia has been corrected.

Other issues are noted in the resident's progress note. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. An arterial line and presep catheter have been placed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma due to the patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes, ventricular ependymoma, and dementia. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia and septic shock from lower lobe pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis/hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hypernatremia. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 550 mL, RR set at 20, PS of 5 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 100. His blood pressure is low (104/62 mmHg), heart rate is elevated (112 bpm), and oxygen saturation is within normal range (SpO2: 95%). The patient has crackles in the chest and increased bibasilar opacities with loss of diaphragm definition on chest X-ray.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 212 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has a central line, arterial line, and pressure catheter in place.

The plan for the patient includes aggressive suctioning of thick secretions, reevaluation for extubation tomorrow, diuresis with reevaluation of effusions"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes, ventricular ependymoma post craniotomy, subdural hematoma, dementia, and septic shock from left lower lobe pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis/hypotension, acute renal failure, and hypernatremia. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He is receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Levofloxacin) and sedation (Fentanyl, Midazolam). The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (112 bpm), low blood pressure (104/62 mmHg), elevated respiratory rate (32 breaths per minute), and slightly elevated body temperature (37.9 C). The patient's blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's CXR shows increased bibasilar opacities with loss of diaphragm definition. The patient's current plan includes aggressive suctioning, evaluation for extubation tomorrow, diuresis with reevaluation of effusions tomorrow, and consideration for reintubation if new therapy identified, otherwise DNI (do not intubate).

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, ventricular ependymoma status post craniotomy, subdural hematoma, and dementia. He presented with septic shock secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia.

The patient currently has respiratory failure due to a previous pneumonia, which resulted in persistent thick secretions. He is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. The plan is to extubate the patient today, but the family only wants reintubation if a new therapy is identified, otherwise they do not wish for do-not-intubate status to be changed.

The patient's sepsis and hypotension related to pneumonia have resolved, and he is now off of pressors. His acute renal failure has also resolved, and his sodium levels are no longer elevated.

The patient is expected to stay in the ICU and will continue with ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate line placements. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The need for restraints will be reviewed regularly.

Overall, the patient's current condition is stable, and he remains in the ICU."

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 .H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76M nursing home resident with a LLL pneumonia who came
   to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
   #. Pneumosepsis: LLL pneumonia in a nursing home patient, with SIRS
   criteria, and lactate of 7.4 on admission.  Lactate down to 2.3 in the
   ICU after 6L NS in ED. Also, known to have dysphagia so at risk for
   aspiration. Had started levofloxacin 1 day prior to admission.   So far
   both sputum and mini BAL without growth
   -Cont levo (day 8); vanco and zosyn (day 7)
   - Pt MRSA negative so will consider d/c vanco if appears to be
   clinically improving.
   - f/u  blood cultures and urine cultures.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated for tachypnea and concern for tiring
   though no abnormal ABG data at time of intubation.  Developed tachypnea
   on [**3-20**] on SBT and put back on AC.  Anxiety likely plays a large
   component, as patient hyperventilates when anxious.  [**Month (only) 60**] do well if
   simply extubated.
   - will decrease PS today if possible
   - holding haldol/seroquel for now
   - speak to guardian about patient
s preferences re: re-intubation
   should he fail extubation
   -after optimization, will attempt extubation possibly tomorrow after
   bronch.
   #. Left hemiparesis:  Communicated with nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 213**] on [**3-18**]
   and she confirms that patient has had left hemiparesis x 4 years.
   - continue to follow
   #. ARF- Cr on arrival 1.7 down to 0.9 this am. Most likely prerenal.
   Baseline Cr last time here in [**2152**] was 0.6.
   -Trend Cr., monitor UOP
   #. DM - On novolin sliding scale, metformin and lantus at NH. Will hold
   on metformin for now given ARF but continue insulin
   # h/o SDH- cont home keppra. Per CT in ED, stable now.
   # HTN- Will hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now with borderline low
   BP.
   FEN: cont TF but hold after midnight in anticipation of extubation

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old nursing home resident with LLL pneumonia.
- The patient was admitted to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
- The patient has a history of altered mental status, dysphagia, and left hemiparesis.
- The patient has respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.
- The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with a baseline creatinine of 0.6.
- The patient is a diabetic and is currently on insulin therapy.
- The patient has a history of subdural hematoma (SDH) and hypertension.
- The patient's code status is DNR.
- The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumosepsis: The patient's initial presentation suggests pneumosepsis, which is a severe lung infection that can lead to septic shock and organ dysfunction. The patient's history of LLL pneumonia and the presence of SIRS criteria indicate a high risk for this complication.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) if not managed appropriately. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially require more aggressive interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's ARF could"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76M nursing home resident with a LLL pneumonia who came
   to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
   #. Pneumosepsis: LLL pneumonia in a nursing home patient, with SIRS
   criteria, and lactate of 7.4 on admission.  Lactate down to 2.3 in the
   ICU after 6L NS in ED. Also, known to have dysphagia so at risk for
   aspiration. Had started levofloxacin 1 day prior to admission.   So far
   both sputum and mini BAL without growth
   -Cont levo (day 7); vanco and zosyn (day 6)
   - Pt MRSA negative so will consider d/c vanco if appears to be
   clinically improving.
   - f/u  blood cultures and urine cultures.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated for tachypnea and concern for tiring
   though no abnormal ABG data at time of intubation.  Developed tachypnea
   on [**3-20**] on SBT and put back on AC.  Anxiety likely plays a large
   component, as patient hyperventilates when anxious.  [**Month (only) 60**] do well if
   simply extubated.
   - will decrease PS today if possible
   - holding haldol/seroquel for now
   - speak to guardian about patient
s preferences re: re-intubation
   should he fail extubation
   -Lasix IV today to attempt to get -1L.  then check PM lytes
   -after optimization, will attempt extubation possibly tomorrow.
   #. Left hemiparesis:  Communicated with nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 213**] on [**3-18**]
   and she confirms that patient has had left hemiparesis x 4 years.
   - continue to follow
   #. ARF- Cr on arrival 1.7 down to 0.9 this am. Most likely prerenal.
   Baseline Cr last time here in [**2152**] was 0.6.
   -Trend Cr., monitor UOP
   #. DM - On novolin sliding scale, metformin and lantus at NH. Will hold

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 76-year-old male nursing home resident with lower left lobe pneumonia.
- He was admitted to the ICU with hemodynamic instability and suspected pneumosepsis.
- His lactate level was initially high but has improved to 2.3 in the ICU.
- The patient has dysphagia, which increases the risk of aspiration.
- He was started on levofloxacin one day before admission, but both sputum and mini BAL cultures were negative.
- Current antibiotics include vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
- The patient is intubated for respiratory failure due to tachypnea and concern for fatigue.
- There are no abnormal ABG data at the time of intubation.
- The patient developed tachypnea on March 20th during a spontaneous breathing trial and was put back on assist-control ventilation.
- Anxiety may play a significant role in the patient's hyperventilation.
- It is planned to decrease the pressure support today if possible.
- Haloperidol/quetiapine is being held for now.
- The patient's preferences regarding re-intubation should he fail extubation need to be discussed with the guardian.
- Lasix IV will be given today to attempt to remove 1 liter of fluid, followed by checking the patient's morning lab values.
- After optimization, extubation may be attempted tomorrow.

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76-year-old nursing home resident admitted to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely due to pneumonia (pneumosepsis). He has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/59 to 68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and has shown improvement in his chest X-ray. He has a history of left hemiparesis, diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, and subdural hematoma. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator and consider extubation possibly tomorrow after a bronchoscopy. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumosepsis: The patient's condition of pneumonia has led to hemodynamic instability, indicating a severe infection that may progress to septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of reintubation if extubation fails.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has dysphagia, which increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creat"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76M nursing home resident with a LLL pneumonia who came
   to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated for tachypnea and concern for tiring
   though no abnormal ABG data at time of intubation.  Developed tachypnea
   on [**3-20**] on SBT and put back on AC.  Anxiety likely plays a large
   component, as patient hyperventilates when anxious.  [**Month (only) 60**] do well if
   simply extubated.
   - bronch and extubate today
   - no plan for re-intubation if fails extubation per discussion with
   guardian, [**Name (NI) 8131**], because failure would likely be secondary to an
   irreversible process
   - Scopolamine patch after extubation to reduce oral secretions
   - holding haldol/seroquel for now
   - lasix prn to reduce pulmonary edema
   #. Pneumosepsis: LLL pneumonia in a nursing home patient, with SIRS
   criteria, and lactate of 7.4 on admission.  Lactate down to 2.3 in the
   ICU after 6L NS in ED. Also, known to have dysphagia so at risk for
   aspiration. Had started levofloxacin 1 day prior to admission.   So far
   both sputum and mini BAL without growth
   -Cont levo (day 9); vanco and zosyn (day 8)
   - Pt MRSA negative so will consider d/c vanco if appears to be
   clinically improving.
   - may also consider d/c levofloxacin because has completed a course and
   atypical coverage likely unnecessary at this time
   - f/u blood cultures and urine cultures.
   #. Left hemiparesis:  Communicated with nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 213**] on [**3-18**]
   and she confirms that patient has had left hemiparesis x 4 years.
   - continue to follow
   #. ARF- Cr on arrival 1.7 down to baseline now of 0.9-1.1. Most likely
   prerenal. Baseline Cr last time here in [**2152**] was 0.6.
   -Trend Cr., monitor UOP
   #. DM - On novolin sliding scale, metformin and lantus at NH. Will hold
   on metformin for now given ARF but continue insulin
   # h/o SDH- cont home keppra. Per CT in ED, stable now.
   # HTN- Will hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now with borderline low
   BP.
   FEN: cont TF but hold after midnight in anticipation of extubation
   PPX: PPI
   ACCESS: RIJ, R A line
   CODE STATUS: DNR, do not re-intubate per guardian.  Pressors OK.

","Summary:
- Mr. [**Known lastname 8130**] is a 76-year-old nursing home resident with a left lower lobe pneumonia.
- He was admitted to the ICU with hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis.
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics.
- His recent vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/59 to 68/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but has been decreasing over time.
- His hemoglobin level is 10.0 g/dL, platelet count is 175,000/mm^3, and creatinine level is within normal range.
- The patient has a history of left hemiparesis, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, subdural hematoma, and hypertension.
- His current plan includes bronchoscopic evaluation, possible extubation, and weaning from the ventilator.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If he fails extubation, there may be a need for re-intubation, but the plan is to not re-intubate if extubation fails.
