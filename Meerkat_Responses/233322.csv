   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M CAD, AF, esrd presents with cardiogenic shock after PVI
   1. Shock: Appears cardiogenic in nature most likely demand ischemia
   vesrus acute coronary syndrome, given rapidity of onset, appears less
   consistent with sepsis.  Duration does not appear to be consistent with
   post-anaesthesia hypotension.
    - will obtain repeat TTE
    - continue to cycle ekg, cardiac enzymes, CVO2, lactate
    - will place CVL IJ to monitor CVP and CVO2
    - f/u culture data
    - will continue abx for now (vanc/cefepime/flagyl) and f/u
   blood/urine/sputum cultures
    - Levo and vasopressin for pressors
    - Patient appears volume overloaded and will cont CVVH with aim TBB -
   150/hr
   2. tachycardia/VT: episodes of both monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   likely [**3-5**] ischemia, now s/p magnesium and amiodarone
    - recieved amio 150 and now 0.5mg/hr
   3. Metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, likely [**3-5**] cardiogenic
   shock
   - f/[**Location 134**] abdominal CT
    - surgical service following, no current indication for surgical
   procedure
   4. Respiratory failure: ? R to left shunt, pulmonary edema - P/F < 200
   but given presence of heart failure and relatively compliant lungs
   appears less consistent with ARDS
    - will continue hyperventilation to assist acid-base status
    - cont tbb negative with CVVH
    - TTE with bubble study today
   5. CAD: holding bb, cont statin, cont asa

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, end-stage renal disease, and atrial fibrillation. He presented for an elective pulmonary vein isolation procedure but experienced back pain and hypotension post-procedure. He was admitted to the MICU due to hypotension and developed progressive respiratory failure. Repeat lactate levels were elevated, and he experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia. A bedside transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) revealed global hypokinesis, indicating possible cardiogenic shock. The patient also developed a marked metabolic acidosis and was intubated. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 100%, and Vt of 600 mL. Pressors include norepinephrine, levo, and vasopressin. The patient has a history of allergies to Percocet and confusion/delirium. He is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, amiodarone, dextrose, and sodium bicarbonate. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, troponin-T, TCO2, glucose, and liver enzymes. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his cardiogenic shock, tachycardia, metabolic acid"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis
   includes cardiogenic shock possibly from MI, PE, or decompensated CHF
   in the setting of volume overload.  No evidence of hemorrhage with
   stable Hct and no tamponade on echo. Septic shock also in the
   differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to post op make
   this less likely.  Episodes of poly and monoporphic Vtach and
   increasing troponin lead one to cardiogenic shock due to ischemic
   event.  Tachycardia and hypoxia in setting of recent surgery indicate
   possible PE, however no clots on LENIs.
   - continue cvvh at 150
 200  cc/hr fluid removal
   - cycle enzymes for nadir (although troponin leak to be expected s/p
   PVI)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin though would consider dopamine
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.
   - continue amio gtt
   - f/u EP recs
   - would trend lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat pain
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs q6 hr
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improving with diuresis with
   CVVH.  Would also consider PE with INR 1.7 on admission, not on
   coumadin b/c of GI bleeds.
   - management of heart failure as above
   - continue to wean vent settings
   - will continue hyperventilation to assist acid-base status
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now.
   -- NPO including medications
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib and s/p PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as
   described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB
   - EP reccs
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - continue cvvh at goal 150-200 ml/hr fluid removal
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath, R arterial line, R PIV, Right
   subclavian HD catheter
   #PPX PPI
   #Dispo CCU

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, and atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. He is now in the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic shock.

The patient has multiple medical complications including:

1. Hypotension/likely cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension could be due to cardiogenic shock possibly from myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism (PE), or decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) with volume overload. No evidence of hemorrhage or tamponade on echocardiogram. Septic shock is also in the differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to the surgery make this less likely.

2. Tachycardia: The patient had episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) thought secondary to ischemia. He was given magnesium and started on amiodarone. Then, he had an atrial tachycardia and was successfully cardioverted back into sinus rhythm but later spontaneously reverted back to tachycardia.

3. Metabolic acid"

   - per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4425**], in the morning given 150 mg amio, cardioverted
   --> back in SVT --> cardioverted again around 1PM --> returned to SVT,
   but rate of RVR slowed over the course of the day
   - ET tube advanced based on CXR findings
   - hepatically cleared meds held given shock liver
   - volume removed via CVVH aggressively

- The patient presented with hypotension and was given 150 mg of amiodarone for SVT, but they continued to experience SVT episodes throughout the day.
- The patient's ET tube was advanced based on CXR findings.
- Hepatically cleared medications were held due to liver dysfunction.
- Aggressive CVVH was performed to remove volume.
- Anticoagulation was not administered as per the doctor's request.
- The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics including metronidazole, cefepime, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.
- The patient is on several infusions including midazolam, vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, amiodarone, KCl, and calcium gluconate via CRRT.
- Other medications include various ICU medications.
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/53 to 119/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 8,699 mL and output of 14,395 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 5,696 mL.
- The patient is on CPAP/PSV with set tidal volume of 550 mL and spontaneous tidal volume of 484 mL. PEEP is set at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and RR at 20 breaths per minute.

- Microbiology results are pending.
- Assessment includes renal failure, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of vasopressors may increase the risk of stress ulcers.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI): The presence of multiple lines and catheters increases the risk of CRBSI.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current renal failure and ongoing fluid management may lead to further deterioration of renal function.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient is already experiencing atrial fibrillation, and the use of amiodarone may increase the risk of other arrhythmias.
7. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive cultures suggest an ongoing infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis.

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis
   includes cardiogenic shock possibly from MI, PE, or decompensated CHF
   in the setting of volume overload.  No evidence of hemorrhage with
   stable Hct and no tamponade on echo. Septic shock also in the
   differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to post op make
   this less likely.  Episodes of poly and monoporphic Vtach and
   increasing troponin lead one to conclude cardiogenic shock due to
   ischemic event.  Tachycardia and hypoxia in setting of recent surgery
   indicate possible PE, however no clots on LENIs.
   - continue cvvh at 150
 200  cc/hr fluid removal
   - cycle enzymes for nadir
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin though would consider dopamine
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.
   - continue amio gtt
   - f/u EP recs
   - would trend lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat pain
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs q6 hr
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improving with diuresis with
   CVVH.  Would also consider PE with INR 1.7 on admission, not on
   coumadin b/c of GI bleeds.
   - management of heart failure as above
   - continue to wean vent settings reduce rate and reduce PEEP
   - slow down hyperventilation given improvement with acid-base status
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now likely
   secondary to ileus.
   -- NPO including medications
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib and s/p PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as
   described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB
   - EP recs
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - continue cvvh at goal 150-200 ml/hr fluid removal
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)

","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent low blood pressure, which can be indicative of shock. The differential diagnosis includes cardiogenic shock, septic shock, and hypovolemic shock.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely suffering from acute respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload or pulmonary edema. Oxygenation is improving with diuresis and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration).

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has secondary metabolic acidosis due to elevated lactate levels in the setting of hypoperfusion. However, it is now drifting downward, indicating improvement.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT (ventricular tachycardia) thought to be secondary to ischemia. The patient has been given magnesium and started on amiodarone. Atrial tachycardia occurred, and the patient underwent cardioversion with reversion into sinus rhythm for a short time before reverting back to tachycardia.

5. Gastroparesis: The patient has no bowel sounds, and NG (nasogastric) lavage revealed stagnant gastric contents, suggesting gastroparesis. Medications are not likely to be absorbed orally due to ileus.

6. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient likely has ""shock liver"" from poor perfusion,"

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock. Differential
   diagnosis includes cardiogenic shock possibly from MI, PE, or
   decompensated CHF in the setting of volume overload.  No evidence of
   hemorrhage with stable Hct and no tamponade on echo. Septic shock also
   in the differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to post
   op make this less likely.  Episodes of poly and monoporphic Vtach and
   increasing troponin lead one to conclude cardiogenic shock due to
   ischemic event.  Tachycardia and hypoxia in setting of recent surgery
   indicate possible PE, however no clots on LENIs.
   - continue cvvh at 150

   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now titrate to maps >65
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   - obtain endotracheal sputum prior to extubation
   - Check c diff given ileus, consider KUB
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.
   - continue amio gtt
   - f/u EP recs
   - would trend lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat pain

   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improving with diuresis with
   CVVH.  Would also consider PE with INR 1.7 on admission, not on
   coumadin b/c of GI bleeds.
   - goal to extubate today, no need to readjust tube
   - management of heart failure as above
   - continue to wean vent settings reduce rate and reduce PEEP
   - slow down hyperventilation given improvement with acid-base status
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs q6 hr
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now likely
   secondary to ileus.
   -- NPO including medications
   - Consider KUB per above
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) status post repair, and atrial fibrillation (AF). He underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) on 05/14/2015 and was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. He is now being transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic shock.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension/shock: Most likely cardiogenic shock. Differential diagnosis includes cardiogenic shock possibly from MI, PE, or decompensated CHF in the setting of volume overload. No evidence of hemorrhage with stable Hct and no tamponade on echo. Septic shock also in the differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to post-op make this less likely. Episodes of poly and monomorphic Vtach and increasing troponin lead one to conclude cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event. Tachycardia and hypoxia in the setting of recent surgery indicate possible PE, however no clots on LENIs.

   Disposition: CCU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) on 05/14/2154 and was admitted to the MICU for hypotension. He is now transferred to the CCU for management of cardiogenic shock.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, possibly secondary to an ischemic event. Other differentials include hemorrhage, tamponade, septic shock, or pulmonary embolism (PE). The rapid onset and temporal relation to post-operative make septic shock less likely. The patient's tachycardia, hypoxia, and recent surgery indicate a possible PE, but no clots were found on leg exams.

2. Tachycardia: The patient had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), thought to be secondary to ischemia. He was given magnesium and started on amiodarone. He then developed atrial tachycardia and underwent cardioversion, reverting into sinus rhythm briefly before reverting back to tachycardia.

   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD,
   renal cell carcinoma, GIB, AAA s/p repair, AF who underwent elective
   pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was transferred to the MICU
   post-procedure for hypotension, and is now transferred to the CCU for
   further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2154-5-17**] 04:36 PM
 PICC LINE - START [**2154-5-17**] 10:36 PM
   - discussed with renal: concerned that he has citrate toxicity, because
   total Ca is high while iCal is low. They want to switch to heparin as
   the anticoagulant. Agreed this was okay, with understanding we will
   have to watch HCT closely give prior chronic GI bleeding.
   - Extubation after level of arousal increased
   - SVT and hypotension after hypotension - responded to 2.5 mg verapamil
   - pressure actually came up so repeated
   - CXR report not final and scheduled not yet performed at 18:50
   - ID approval for vancomycin done - this is empiric Rx for hypotension
   - Called PICC team and they are going to try to come by soon, or worst
   case in a.m., then we can remove sheaths (likely with EP in a.m.)
   - Updated family
   - Repeat EKG tonight, now slower after verapamil.
   - CVVH filter clotted and replaced
   - PICC placed late evening - confirm placement then okay to pull
   sheaths - EP will likely do this.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin lead likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event.
   - continue cvvh at 150
 200  cc/hr fluid removal
   - cycle enzymes for nadir
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now titrate to maps >65
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   - Check c diff given ileus, consider KUB
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.
   - continue amio gtt
   - f/u EP recs
   - would trend lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses
   - change anticoagulation to heparin
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - continue cvvh at goal 150-200 ml/hr fluid removal and increase as bp
   tolerates
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH
   and pt extubated yesterday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now likely
   secondary to ileus.
   -- NPO including medications
   - Consider KUB per above
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (2.8 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib and s/p PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as
   described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath, R arterial line, R PIV, Right
   subclavian HD catheter
   #PPX PPI
   #Dispo CCU

   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin lead likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event.

   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.

   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses
   - change anticoagulation to heparin
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - continue cvvh at goal 150-200 ml/hr fluid removal and increase as bp
   tolerates
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - continue olanzapine PRN

   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH
   and pt extubated yesterday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) and volume overload. This is indicated by hypotension, low cardiac output, and evidence of pulmonary edema.

2. Sepsis: Although less likely compared to cardiogenic shock, septic shock should still be considered due to the patient's hypotension. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen accordingly is important.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), which could be secondary to ischemia. Appropriate antiarrhythmic medications have been started, and close monitoring of the electrocardiogram (EKG) is necessary.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). There is evidence of citrate toxicity due to low ionized calcium levels despite calcium boluses. Changing the anticoagulation to heparin is recommended.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely secondary to weaning of sedation medications, ICU delirium, and hepatic encephalopathy. Olanzapine has been given, but it has"

   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD,
   renal cell carcinoma, GIB, AAA s/p repair, AF who underwent elective
   pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was transferred to the MICU
   post-procedure for hypotension, and is now transferred to the CCU for
   further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2154-5-17**] 04:36 PM
 PICC LINE - START [**2154-5-17**] 10:36 PM
   - discussed with renal: concerned that he has citrate toxicity, because
   total Ca is high while iCal is low. They want to switch to heparin as
   the anticoagulant. Agreed this was okay, with understanding we will
   have to watch HCT closely give prior chronic GI bleeding.
   - Extubation after level of arousal increased
   - SVT and hypotension after hypotension - responded to 2.5 mg verapamil
   - pressure actually came up so repeated
   - CXR report not final and scheduled not yet performed at 18:50
   - ID approval for vancomycin done - this is empiric Rx for hypotension
   - Called PICC team and they are going to try to come by soon, or worst
   case in a.m., then we can remove sheaths (likely with EP in a.m.)
   - Updated family
   - Repeat EKG tonight, now slower after verapamil.
   - CVVH filter clotted and replaced
   - PICC placed late evening - confirm placement then okay to pull
   sheaths - EP will likely do this.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event.
   - talk with renal for course of CVVH given length of stay fluid removal
   is 5 L negative (about what he received following his ablation
   procedure) and he should be nearing euvolemia. Will continue 150
 200
   cc/hr fluid removal for now
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH
   and pt extubated yesterday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (2.8 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Mr. [**Known lastname 980**], a 71-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, and AF, underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**]. He was transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension and is now in the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
- The patient had episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT, which were managed with magnesium and amiodarone.
- He is currently experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to decompensated CHF in the setting of volume overload. Sepsis is still in the differential, but less likely.
- The patient has an altered mental status, which may be secondary to weaning of sedation medications, ICU delirium, or hepatic encephalopathy.
- His groin sheaths are still in place and will be pulled once the PICC line is confirmed.
- The patient has respiratory failure, likely primarily secondary to volume overload/pulmonary edema. Oxygenation improved with CVVH and the patient was extubated yesterday.
- He has metabolic acidosis, which is secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in the setting of hypoperfusion. Lactate is improving.
- The patient has gastroparesis with no bowel sounds and stagnant gastric contents initially. He is NPO including medications"

   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD,
   renal cell carcinoma, GIB, AAA s/p repair, AF who underwent elective
   pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was transferred to the MICU
   post-procedure for hypotension, and is now transferred to the CCU for
   further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2154-5-17**] 04:36 PM
 PICC LINE - START [**2154-5-17**] 10:36 PM
   - discussed with renal: concerned that he has citrate toxicity, because
   total Ca is high while iCal is low. They want to switch to heparin as
   the anticoagulant. Agreed this was okay, with understanding we will
   have to watch HCT closely give prior chronic GI bleeding.
   - Extubation after level of arousal increased
   - SVT and hypotension after hypotension - responded to 2.5 mg verapamil
   - pressure actually came up so repeated
   - CXR report not final and scheduled not yet performed at 18:50
   - ID approval for vancomycin done - this is empiric Rx for hypotension
   - Called PICC team and they are going to try to come by soon, or worst
   case in a.m., then we can remove sheaths (likely with EP in a.m.)
   - Updated family
   - Repeat EKG tonight, now slower after verapamil.
   - CVVH filter clotted and replaced
   - PICC placed late evening - confirm placement then okay to pull
   sheaths - EP will likely do this.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event.
   - talk with renal for course of CVVH given length of stay fluid removal
   is 5 L negative (about what he received following his ablation
   procedure) and he should be nearing euvolemia. Will continue 150
 200
   cc/hr fluid removal for now
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH
   and pt extubated yesterday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (2.8 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath (to be pulled today now that has PICC),
   R arterial line, R PIV, Right subclavian HD catheter, right PICC
   #PPX PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- Mr. [**Known lastname 980**], a 71-year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, and AF, underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**]. He was transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension and is now in the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is suspected to have cardiogenic shock from decompensated CHF in the setting of volume overload. Sepsis is still in the differential given hypotension, but it is less likely. The patient had episodes of poly and monomorphic VT, and increasing troponin levels likely from an ischemic event.
2. Tachycardia: The patient had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT thought secondary to ischemia, given magnesium and started on amiodarone. Then, he developed atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial flutter.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient is currently on CV"

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event. Iatrogenic hypovolemia is also
   a possibility. Sepsis less likely given white  count trending down and
   no growth in cultures and no obvious source.
   - Will discuss with renal whether pt needs some fluid repletion via
   CVVH (4L neg negative length of stay)
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely primarily secondary to volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH and pt extubated
   on Friday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: improvement given improving INR. likely shock
   liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (1.7 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. He underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) on 05/14/2018 and was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. He is now being transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic shock.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to cardiogenic shock from decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) in the setting of volume overload. Sepsis is less likely given the trending down white blood cell count and no growth in cultures. The patient also had episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and increasing troponin levels, indicating a possible ischemic event.

2. Tachycardia: The patient had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT, which were managed with magnesium and amiodarone. He also had atrial tachycardia and was cardioverted twice, reverting back into atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation (AF).

3. ESRD on HD: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CV"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is hypotension, and the patient is being treated with vasopressin, amiodarone, and norepinephrine infusions. 

The patient has a history of renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL and the presence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient is also experiencing delirium/confusion, atrial fibrillation (AF), and acute respiratory failure. 

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including arterial blood gas analysis, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation profile, cardiac enzymes, and cultures from urine, blood, and sputum. The results of these tests are within normal limits, except for the elevated levels of AST/ALT, lactate, LDH, and troponin-T. 

The patient's vital signs show persistent hypotension with a blood pressure of 83/56 mmHg, despite the vasopressor support. The heart rate is elevated at 102 bpm, and the patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% with the use of an aerosol-cool device. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,096 mL and an output of 3,352 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -256 mL. The patient's urine output is noted to be only 40 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 118 K/uL. The electrolytes are relatively normal, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.5 mg/dL.

Imaging studies have not revealed any significant findings, and the microbiology reports show no growth of microorganisms in the sputum and urine cultures.

The patient's current treatment plan includes the continuation of vasopressor support, close monitoring of vancomycin levels, and adjustment of antibiotic dosing as necessary. The patient is also receiving medications for stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. 

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing management of multiple organ dysfunction and a focus on optimizing fluid balance, respiratory support, and antibiotic therapy."

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event. Hypovolemia is also a
   possibility given 4L negative from ultrafiltration however less likely
   given he was given 4L during the procedure. Sepsis less likely given
   white count trending down and no growth in cultures and no obvious
   source.
   - Will discuss with renal whether pt needs some fluid repletion via
   CVVH (4L neg negative length of stay)
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely primarily secondary to volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH and pt extubated
   on Friday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: improvement given improving INR. likely shock
   liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (1.7 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath (to be pulled today now that has PICC),
   R arterial line, R PIV, Right subclavian HD catheter, right PICC
   #PPX Pneumaboots, PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, and atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) on [**2154-5-14**] and was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. He is now transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Hypotension/shock: The most likely cause is cardiogenic shock due to decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) with volume overload. Sepsis is less likely given the absence of fever, stable white blood cell count, and negative cultures.
2. Tachycardia: The patient had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), which were treated with magnesium and amiodarone. He also experienced atrial tachycardia, which was cardioverted twice but reverted back into atrial tachycardia versus atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with a rate of 150 cc"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event. Hypovolemia is also a
   possibility given 4L negative from ultrafiltration however less likely
   given he was given 4L during the procedure. Sepsis less likely given
   white count trending down and no growth in cultures and no obvious
   source.
   - Will discuss with renal whether pt needs some fluid repletion via
   CVVH (4L neg negative length of stay)
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely primarily secondary to volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH and pt extubated
   on Friday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: improvement given improving INR. likely shock
   liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (1.7 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath (to be pulled today now that has PICC),
   R arterial line, R PIV, Right subclavian HD catheter, right PICC
   #PPX Pneumaboots, PPI
   #Dispo CCU

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Patient was undergoing a KUB to assess his abdominal pain, during this
   film the patient became unresponsive and pulseless with electrical
   activity. CPR was immediately initiated with several rounds of
   epinephrine and bicarbonate given. The patient regained his pulse 3
   times and each time lost his pulse and went into PEA. The patient at
   one point had a wide complex tachycardia and was shocked to no affect.
   The patient was started on a dopamine and epinephrine drip in addition
   to his vasopressin and norepinephrine. The patient also received
   heparin bolus + gtt for empiric PE tx, bicarb for empiric acidosis and
   hyperkalemia tx, empiric insulin/glucagon/calcium for empiric
   hyperkalemia treatment. EKG revealed ST elevations in aVR and V1, V2
   consistent with global ischemia. Code STEMI was called and pt was to be
   taken to the cath lab until he lost his pulse again. No reversible
   cause could be identified. After the third set of CPR of over 90
   minutes of a code, the patient remained pulseless and the code was
   called as it was deemed that there was no hope for recovery.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and atrial fibrillation (AF). He underwent an elective pulmonary vein isolation procedure on [2154-5-14] and was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. He is now in the CCU for further management of cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, renal failure, AF, and respiratory failure. He has a history of CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, and AF.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) in the setting of volume overload. Sepsis is less likely given the absence of fever, white blood cell count trending down, and no growth in cultures. The patient's blood pressure improves when his heart rate is in the low 100s.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) secondary to ischemia. He was given magnesium and started on amiodarone. He also had atrial tachycardia and is now post-card"
