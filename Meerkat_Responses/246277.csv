   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now back in sinus
   tachycardia.
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension experienced on admission.
   - stopped amidarone yesterday and started patient on verapamil and
   quinidine sulfate 200mg PO q6hr
   - tele
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital.  Extubated yesterday- did well.  No signs of
   respiratory distress.
   - d/c levo given tendency to prolong QT
   - stopped flagyl given unlikeliness of aspiration PNA
   - on NC- satting well.
   - continue home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast,
   fluticasone)
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 140s.
   - phenylephrine PRN hypotension
   - stress-dose steroids
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   - ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
   global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with atrial
   fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of 25-30%.
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - restarted ASA yesterday
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and was changed to fluconazole/augmentin
   yesterday in anticipation of discharge.  Diet recently advanced to
   regular but softs
   - d/c
ed fluconazole one day early due to risk of prolonging QT

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), biventricular pacemaker, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient presented with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing due to missing rate control agents. He is now in sinus rhythm.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which was likely triggered by stopping sotalol and metoprolol. This condition increases the risk of clot formation, stroke, and heart failure.

2. Respiratory decompensation: The patient has a history of asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). He initially retained carbon dioxide upon arrival to the critical care unit and experienced intermittent hypoxia. This may be due to bronchospasm, aspiration pneumonia, or volume overload. The patient was intubated but successfully extubated yesterday without signs of respiratory distress.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension initially but resolved with the use of phenylephrine and stress-dose steroids.

4. Heart failure: The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30% as per the recent echocardiogram. This indicates moderate to severe systolic dysfunction and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing due to missing his rate control agents. The patient is now in sinus rhythm.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation, likely triggered by stopping sotalol and metoprolol. It was later converted to sinus rhythm.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient had a history of asthma and Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP), initially retaining CO2 on arrival to the CCU. He received repeated doses of Ativan but showed no signs of hypoventilation or respiratory distress after extubation.

3. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has since resolved. His blood pressure is now in the 140s-150s.

4. Cardiac Function: The patient has a moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction. An echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%.

5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient reported a ""heart attack"" with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) but no intervention"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now back in sinus
   tachycardia.
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension experienced on admission.
   - stopped amidarone yesterday and started patient on verapamil and
   quinidine sulfate 200mg PO q6hr
   - tele
   - EKG today
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital.  Extubated yesterday- did well.  No signs of
   respiratory distress.
   - d/c levo given tendency to prolong QT
   - stopped flagyl given unlikeliness of aspiration PNA.
   - discontinue augmentin today
   - on RA- satting well.
   - continue home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast,
   fluticasone)
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 140s-150s.
   - Restart home lisinopril 20mg PO daily
   - continue verapamil.
   - stress-dose steroids
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   - ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
   global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with atrial
   fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of 25-30%.
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - restarted ASA yesterday
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and was changed to fluconazole/augmentin
   yesterday in anticipation of discharge.  Diet recently advanced to

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, previously implanted with an ICD and biV pacer, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing, which occurred due to missing his rate control agents. The patient converted back to sinus rhythm after receiving amiodarone and diltiazem.

The patient had respiratory decompensation, initially retaining CO2 on arrival to the CCU. He had a history of asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and his bronchospasm was worsened by frequent dosing of metoprolol. He was intubated on admission but extubated the previous day without any signs of respiratory distress. His respiratory status improved, and he was able to sit up in a chair, with stable blood pressure and heart rate.

The patient experienced hypotension, which resolved with the restart of his home lisinopril medication and stress-dose steroids. An echocardiogram showed moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and increased mitral regurgitation with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response.

The patient had a reported ""heart attack"" with PCI but no intervention, and cardiac enzymes were severely elevated. An EKG showed"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now back in sinus
   tachycardia.
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension experienced on admission.
   - stopped amidarone yesterday and started patient on verapamil and
   quinidine sulfate 200mg PO q6hr
   - tele
   - EKG today
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital.  Extubated yesterday- did well.  No signs of
   respiratory distress.
   - d/c levo given tendency to prolong QT
   - stopped flagyl given unlikeliness of aspiration PNA.
   - discontinue augmentin today
   - on RA- satting well.
   - continue home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast,
   fluticasone)
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 140s-150s.
   - Restart home lisinopril 20mg PO daily
   - continue verapamil.
   - stress-dose steroids
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   - ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
   global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with atrial
   fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of 25-30%.
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - restarted ASA yesterday
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and was changed to fluconazole/augmentin
   yesterday in anticipation of discharge.  Diet recently advanced to
   regular but softs
   - d/c
ed fluconazole one day early due to risk of prolonging QT
   - f/u thoracics recs (following as consults)

   tolerated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ICD/biV pacer, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing due to missing his rate control agents. The patient is now in sinus rhythm.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and it was likely triggered by stopping sotalol and metoprolol. The patient's baseline rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but the pacer turns off at rates >150, and his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed. ICD firing occurred because of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.

2. Respiratory decompensation: The patient has a history of asthma and BOOP. Initially, he was retaining CO2 on arrival to the CCU. It is possible that his bronchospasm was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol. He has also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now back in sinus
   tachycardia.
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension experienced on admission.
   - stopped amidarone yesterday and started patient on verapamil and
   quinidine sulfate 200mg PO q6hr
   - tele
   .
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital.  Extubated yesterday- did well.  No signs of
   respiratory distress.
   - d/c levo given tendency to prolong QT
   - stopped flagyl given unlikeliness of aspiration PNA
   - on NC- satting well.
   - continue home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast,
   fluticasone)
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 140s.
   - phenylephrine PRN hypotension
   - stress-dose steroids
   .
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   - ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
   global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with atrial
   fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of 25-30%.
   .
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - restarted ASA yesterday
   .
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and was changed to fluconazole/augmentin
   today in anticipation of discharge.  Diet recently advanced to full
   liquids.
   - will continue antibiotics until at least 8/21 per thoracic plan
   - f/u thoracics recs (following as consults)
   - per thoracics, OK to place OGT if prolonged intubation
   .
   FEN: IVFs PRN, monitor and replete lytes PRN, will advance diet as
   tolerated when able to take PO

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  Now in sinus rhythm.
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now back in sinus
   tachycardia.
   - holding metoprolol given hypotension experienced on admission.
   - stopped amidarone yesterday and started patient on verapamil and
   quinidine sulfate 200mg PO q6hr
   - tele
   - EKG today
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital.  Extubated yesterday- did well.  No signs of
   respiratory distress.
   - d/c levo given tendency to prolong QT
   - stopped flagyl given unlikeliness of aspiration PNA.
   - discontinue augmentin today
   - on RA- satting well.
   - continue home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast,
   fluticasone)
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 140s-150s.
   - Restart home lisinopril 20mg PO daily
   - continue verapamil.
   - stress-dose steroids
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   - ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
   global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with atrial
   fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of 25-30%.
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - restarted ASA yesterday
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and was changed to fluconazole/augmentin
   yesterday in anticipation of discharge.  Diet recently advanced to
   regular but softs
   - d/c
ed fluconazole one day early due to risk of prolonging QT

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, who was admitted with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing. The patient has been stable all day, mostly in sinus rhythm but intermittently in wide complex atrial fibrillation/rate ventricular response. Augmentin was discontinued today due to the risk of prolonging QTc, as shown on the EKG. The patient ambulated without difficulties and is scheduled for outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8414**].

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and it is likely triggered by stopping sotalol and metoprolol. It is important to maintain rate control in this patient to prevent recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation.

2. Respiratory decompensation: The patient has a history of asthma and bronchiolitis obliterate organizing pneumonia (BOOP). He initially retained CO2 upon arrival to the CCU and may have worsening bronchospasm, especially with frequent dosing of metoprolol. There is also a possibility of hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive, as well as aspiration pneumonia (right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray) and some degree of volume overload noted on chest X-ray. The patient was intubated on admission but was successfully extubated yesterday"

   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now back in sinus

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ICD/biV pacer, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing due to missing rate control agents. He is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient has a baseline rhythm of sinus sensed, v-paced, with the pacer turning off at rates >150. His native conduction is exposed (LBBB). The patient experienced hypotension, respiratory decompensation, and esophageal inflammation. His condition has been managed with various medications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and palpitations.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient had respiratory decompensation, possibly due to asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), hypoventilation, hypoxia, and aspiration pneumonia. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation but is now extubated and doing well.
3. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has since resolved. It may have been caused by factors such as medication side effects or cardiogenic shock.
4. Esophageal Inflammation: The patient had esophageal inflammation, which could have led to complications like esophageal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  In sinus rhythm overnight,
   but going into wide complex atrial fib with RVR.
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now alternating
   between the two.
   - stopped amidarone yesterday and started patient on verapamil and
   quinidine gluconate 324 q8 hours
   - tele
   - EKG today
   - will call EP today and discuss quinidine vs. sotalol Rx
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital.  Extubated yesterday- did well.  No signs of
   respiratory distress.
   - now off levo given tendency to prolong QT
   - stopped flagyl given unlikeliness of aspiration PNA.
   - discontinued augmentin
   - on RA- satting well.
   - continue home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast,
   fluticasone)
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 120s-140s.
   - Restarted home lisinopril 20mg PO daily
   - continue verapamil.
   - stress-dose steroids
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   - ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
   global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with atrial
   fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of 25-30%.
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - restarted ASA yesterday
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and now off Abx.  Diet recently advanced
   to regular but softs
   - d/c
ed fluconazole one day early due to risk of prolonging QT

   - on verapamil and quinidine gluconate- increased quinidine gluconate
   from q8 to q6hr
   - continue IV verapamil when patient goes into elevated rate
   - Will start metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] this AM to better control his rate and

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had brief episode of Afib with RVR this AM up to 170s. Patient
   given verapamil 5mg IV times 3 with good response.  Lorazepam changed
   to 1mg PO BID standing plus q8h PRN.  EP saw patient and recommended
   diuresis with 20mg IV lasix and increasing quinidine to 324mg PO q6h.
   Iron studies sent and consistent with anemia of chronic disease, TSH
   WNL.  Retic count pending.  PICC line not pulling back to draw blood.
   TPA infused into each port at 9PM and it did draw back blood, but
   patient is now asleep and do not want to provoke anxiety overnight.
   Will wait to see if can draw morning labs off of PICC before D/C'ing
   central line tomorrow morning.
   -@2300 afib/RVR to 160s, SBP 120s-->verpamil 5 mg IV x 3 -->sinus 80s
   -@5AM: patient to HR=140 with SBP to 140s-> symptomatic after straining
   for BM-> verapamil 5mg IV x 3 and lorazepam 1mg.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  In sinus rhythm overnight,
   but going into wide complex atrial fib with RVR.
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now alternating
   between the two.
   - on verapamil and quinidine gluconate- increased quinidine gluconate
   from q8 to q6hr
   - continue IV verapamil when patient goes into elevated rate
   - Will start metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] this AM to better control his rate and
   sympathetic drive
   - Daily EKGs to monitor QTc on quinidine
   - on telemetry
   .
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital.  Extubated yesterday- did well.  No signs of
   respiratory distress.
   - now off levo given tendency to prolong QT
   - stopped flagyl given unlikeliness of aspiration PNA.
   - discontinued augmentin
   - on RA- satting well.
   - continue home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast,
   fluticasone)
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 120s-140s.
   - Restarted home lisinopril 20mg PO daily
   - continue verapamil and start metoprolol 25mg today
   - stress-dose steroids
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   -          ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with
   severe global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with
   atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of
   25-30%.
   -          Lasix 20mg IV for diuresis yesterday and will give Lasix
   40mg PO dose today with the goal of making the patient 500cc negative;
   Will need lasix 20mg PO daily at home
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - on ASA
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and now off Abx.  Diet recently advanced
   to regular but softs
   - d/c

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, previously implanted with an ICD and biV pacer, presenting with atrial fibrillation (AFib) and rapid ventricular response (RVR). He has been experiencing episodes of AFib with RVR, which were initially uncontrolled and led to ICD firing. The patient's baseline rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but the pacer turns off at rates >150, exposing his native left bundle branch block (LBBB) conduction. He was given verapamil and quinidine gluconate, with an increased dose of quinidine gluconate from q8 to q6hr. Metoprolol 25mg will be started this morning to better control his rate and sympathetic drive. Daily EKGs will be taken to monitor QTc on quinidine. The patient is currently on telemetry.

Other medical conditions include respiratory decompensation, with a history of asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). He initially retained CO2 upon arrival to the CCU and may have worsened bronchospasm due to frequent dosing of metoprolol. Intermittent hypoxia and possible aspiration pneumonia (RLL opacity on CXR) were also noted. The patient was intubated on admission but extubated yesterday without signs of respiratory distress. He is now off levo and flag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), biventricular pacing, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing due to missing rate control agents. He was given verapamil and quinidine gluconate, and his rate control medication was changed to metoprolol. The patient has a baseline rhythm of sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150. He has been alternating between normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation. He also has a history of asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), respiratory decompensation, hypotension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and esophageal inflammation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's baseline rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150, exposing him to wide complex native conduction (LBBB). This increases the risk of ICD firing due to misrecognition of ventricular tachycardia. Frequent dosing of rate control agents is necessary to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of asthma and BOOP, which increases the risk of respiratory decompensation. Frequent dosing of metoprolol"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  In sinus rhythm overnight,
   but going into wide complex atrial fib with RVR.
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now alternating
   between the two.
   - on verapamil and quinidine gluconate- increased quinidine gluconate
   from q8 to q6hr
   -continue IV verapamil when patient goes into elevated rate
   - tele
   - EKG today
   - will call EP today and discuss quinidine vs. sotalol Rx
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital.  Extubated yesterday- did well.  No signs of
   respiratory distress.
   - now off levo given tendency to prolong QT
   - stopped flagyl given unlikeliness of aspiration PNA.
   - discontinued augmentin
   - on RA- satting well.
   - continue home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast,
   fluticasone)
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 120s-140s.
   - Restarted home lisinopril 20mg PO daily
   - continue verapamil.
   - stress-dose steroids
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   -          ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with
   severe global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with
   atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of
   25-30%.
   -          Lasix 20mg IV for diuresis
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - on ASA
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and now off Abx.  Diet recently advanced
   to regular but softs

He was intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration pneumonia (RLL opacity on CXR) +/- some degree of volume overload noted on CXR. The patient was intubated on admission to the hospital but was extubated yesterday without signs of respiratory distress.

The patient's blood pressure is now in the 120s-140s. He was restarted on home lisinopril 20mg PO daily, and stress-dose steroids were continued. An echo shows moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction, increased mitral regurgitation with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm). LVEF of 25-30%. Lasix 20mg IV was given for diuresis.

The patient reported having a ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no intervention, unknown findings. Cardiac enzymes were added onto peri-code labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD firings. An EKG without ischemic changes was noted.

The patient also had esophageal inflammation per thoracic surgery, but it was determined that he never had an esophageal tear, only inflammatory changes. He was on vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and is now off Abx. His diet was recently advanced to regular but soft.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to an irregular and often rapid heart rate, which may increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiac complications. It is important to control the heart rate and maintain sinus rhythm to prevent these complications.

2. Respiratory decompensation: The patient's history of asthma and BOOP increases the risk of respiratory decompensation, especially in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate interventions, such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids, are necessary to manage any respiratory issues.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to several factors, including his cardiac condition, medication side effects, or fluid overload. Monitoring the blood pressure and adjusting medications and fluid balance as needed is important to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Pump dysfunction: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is severely reduced, indicating significant pump dysfunction. This puts the patient at increased risk for heart failure and other cardiovascular events. Close monitoring of cardiac function and appropriate interventions, such as diuretics and isotropic medications, may be necessary to manage these issues.

5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of a reported ""heart attack"" and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest underlying coronary artery disease. Further evaluation of the coronary arteries and potential interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, may be necessary to address any significant blockages.

6. Esophageal inflammation: Although the patient did not have an esophageal tear, the inflammation in the esophagus can still cause discomfort and potential complications. Monitoring the patient's symptoms and providing appropriate supportive care are important.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  No a-fib events in last 24
   hrs.
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now alternating
   between the two.  No a-fib events in last 24 hrs.
   - metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] started on [**9-26**]
   - on verapamil and quinidine gluconate
   - continue IV verapamil when patient goes into elevated rate
   - Daily EKGs to monitor QTc on quinidine
   - on telemetry
   - will d/c on metoprolol, verapamil and quinidine- f/u with outpatient
   cardiologist to adjust these medications
   .
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital, extubated the next day- doing well since.
   - on RA- satting well.
   - on home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast, fluticasone)
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 120s-140s.
   - home lisinopril 20mg PO daily
   - continue verapamil and start metoprolol 25mg today
   - stress-dose steroids- on taper now
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   -          ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with
   severe global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with
   atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of
   25-30%.
   -          Lasix 20mg IV for diuresis on [**9-25**], Lasix 40mg PO dose on
   [**9-26**]
   -          goal of making the patient 500cc negative;
   -          Will need lasix 20mg PO daily at home
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - on ASA
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and now off Abx.  Diet recently advanced
   to regular but softs
   - f/u thoracics recs (following as consults)
   .
   #) Hyponatremia- Sodium trending down this AM (133
 128).  Most likely
   secondary to lasix administration

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), biventricular pacing, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing due to missing rate control agents. The patient has been experiencing respiratory decompensation, hypotension, and other medical conditions.

The patient has a history of asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), which may have contributed to his respiratory difficulties. He also has a known case of esophageal inflammation, possibly due to thoracic surgery. Additionally, the patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30% and is receiving treatment for hyponatremia, likely secondary to lasix administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can lead to an irregular heart rhythm and potential complications such as blood clots or stroke.

2. Respiratory decompensation: The patient's history of asthma and BOOP puts him at risk for further respiratory issues, including exacerbations of asthma symptoms or pneumonia.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires careful monitoring and management to ensure adequate perfusion and organ function.

4. Hyponatremia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 3369**] is a 63 year-old man with a history of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/biV pacer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
   presents with atrial fibrillation resulting in ICD firing in the
   setting of missing his rate control agents.  In sinus rhythm overnight,
   but going into wide complex atrial fib with RVR.
   #) Atrial fibrillation:  Likely triggered by stopping sotalol and
   metoprolol.  Likely the metoprolol had been supressing his sympathetic
   drive recently and prevent recurrent afib.  However, in the setting of
   ambulating on [**9-23**] and no lopressor, he flipped back into it.  Baseline
   rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but pacer turns off at rates >150 and
   his native (LBBB) conduction is exposed.  ICD firing happened because
   of relatively wide complex misrecognized as VT.  He spontaneously
   converted to NSR, reverted to atrial fibrillation, now alternating
   between the two.
   - on verapamil and quinidine gluconate- increased quinidine gluconate
   from q8 to q6hr
   - continue IV verapamil when patient goes into elevated rate
   - Will start metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] this AM to better control his rate and
   sympathetic drive
   - Daily EKGs to monitor QTc on quinidine
   - on telemetry
   .
   #) Respiratory decompensation:  Pt with history asthma + BOOP,
   initially retaining CO2 on arrival to CCU.  Possibly his broncospasm
   was worsened in the setting of frequent dosing of metoprolol.  He has
   also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues
   against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive.  He has also been
   intermittently hypoxic, with questionable aspiration PNA (RLL opacity
   of CXR) +/-some degree of volume overload noted on CXR.  Pt intubated
   on admission to hospital.  Extubated yesterday- did well.  No signs of
   respiratory distress.
   - now off levo given tendency to prolong QT
   - stopped flagyl given unlikeliness of aspiration PNA.
   - discontinued augmentin
   - on RA- satting well.
   - continue home asthma meds (pulmicort, albuterol, montelukast,
   fluticasone)
   #) Hypotension:  Resolved.  BP now in 120s-140s.
   - Restarted home lisinopril 20mg PO daily
   - continue verapamil and start metoprolol 25mg today
   - stress-dose steroids
   #) Pump:  No echo in our system, but by report EF 30%.  Some evidence
   of volume overload on initial CXR, but neither cardiogenic shock nor
   pulmonary edema seem to be the main causes of his decompensation.
   -          ECHO on [**9-24**] shows moderately dilated left ventricle with
   severe global systolic dysfunction. Increased mitral regurgitation with
   atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (175 bpm).  LVEF of
   25-30%.
   -          Lasix 20mg IV for diuresis yesterday and will give Lasix
   40mg PO dose today with the goal of making the patient 500cc negative;
   Will need lasix 20mg PO daily at home
   # Coronaries:  Reported ""heart attack"" [**2156**] with PCI but no
   intervention, unknown findings.  Cardiac enzymes added onto peri-code
   labs and severely elevated, but this was in the setting of multiple ICD
   firings.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - on ASA
   #) Esophageal inflammation:  Per thoracic surgery, he actually never
   had an esophageal tear, only imflammatory changes.  He has been on
   vanc/levo/flagyl/fluconazole and now off Abx.  Diet recently advanced
   to regular but softs
   - d/c
ed fluconazole one day early due to risk of prolonging QT
   - f/u thoracics recs (following as consults)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ICD/biventricular pacer, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented with atrial fibrillation that resulted in ICD firing due to missing rate control agents. The patient's baseline rhythm is sinus sensed, v-paced, but the pacer turns off at rates >150, exposing his native (LBBB) conduction. He spontaneously converted to NSR, then reverted to atrial fibrillation, alternating between the two. The patient is on verapamil and quinidine gluconate, with increased quinidine gluconate from q8 to q6hr. Metoprolol 25mg will be started this AM to better control his rate and sympathetic drive. Daily EKGs will be monitored for QTc on quinidine.

The patient has a history of asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Initially, he retained CO2 on arrival to the CCU. He received frequent doses of metoprolol, which may have worsened bronchospasm. He also received repeated doses of Ativan, but his tachypnea argues against hypoventilation secondary to depressed drive. He has been intermittently hypoxic with questionable aspiration pneumonia (RLL opacity of CXR) +/- some degree of volume overload noted on CXR. The patient was intubated on"
