   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 74F breast ca (XRT), CAD, hospitalized since
   [**12-30**] w/ newly dx met ovarian serous adenoca, b/l PEs on heparin, CMP,
   s/p chemo [**1-4**] ([**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol). Course c/b oral lesions (acyclovir since
   [**1-7**]), persistent tachycardia, SBO/ileus with ongoing diarrhea, recent
   fevers (100.9 X 2 days), dyspnea, new onset of early neutropenia.
   Transferred to ICU after spiking to 103 with concern for sepsis and
   anticipated prolonged neutropenia.  CVL placed. PICC line removed.
   Normotensive overnight with adequate UOP.

   Agree with plan to continue broad empiric coverage (cefepime, vanco,

   continue empiric flagyl with repeat stool c diff cx pending, holding
   octreotide and immodium. We continue to replete lytes aggressively in
   light of diarrhea. Will continue acyclovir for ? HSV oral
   lesions. Droplet precautions pending viral screen. She remains
   normotensive, has been persistently tachy throughout this hospital
   course --? from CMP, PEs, now diarrhea, infection. Will fup TTE
   results, CVP at goal and UOP adequate. Will resume low dose BB.  Resp
   status improved--still appears tachypneic, likely from fever/sepsis/PE

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of ovarian adenocarcinoma, cardiomyopathy, and bilateral pulmonary embolism. She was admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and concern for impending shock. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, tachypnea, lethargy, diarrhea, pancytopenia, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, and serous ovarian adenocarcinoma. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's lab results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and elevated creatinine levels. The preliminary blood culture indicates gram-positive cocci in clusters, and the urine culture shows pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains at high risk for volume depletion and nosocomial infection due to prolonged neutropenia. She is expected to remain in the ICU at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/febrile neutropenia: The patient has signs of infection, including fever and leukopenia, which increases the risk of sepsis, especially considering her immunosuppressed state due to chemotherapy.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin level indicate pancytopenia, which puts her"

   febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and concern for impending shock.
   .
   # Sepsis/febrile neutropenia.  Blood cx [**1-9**] w/ GPC and Urine cx [**1-9**]
   with 10-100,000 pseudomonas. Patient with febrile upon transfer,
   tachycardia, and tachypnea.  Now neutropenic as result of chemo.  Blood
   cultures just turning positive, though is only [**11-28**] - some possibility
   that this is not the source and is only contaminant.  PICC line in
   place and gets TPN.  Other possible sources include urine (UA positive
   yesterday), GI given profuse diarrhea (C.diff negative), infected
   ascites (though malignant - unlikely SBP), pulmonary (though nothing
   yet on CXR).  Viral also possible.  Must consider fungemia given TPN
   use.  Sepsis complicated by neutropenia from chemo and possibility that
   patient may have increased chemo effect given mild renal insufficiency
   at time of dosing (given very early neutropenia).
   - Repeat blood cultures.
   - Viral panel - nasal swab
   - f/u existing cultures.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - TTE today to eval for vegetations.
   - Check lactate and central venous sat again today
   - Antibiotics: continue current regimen very broad for now covering
   blood/line infection, GI and urinary sources, flagyl for ?Cdiff.  Also
   getting acyclovir and fluconazole (was started on fluc for ?candidal
   rash but keeping on more due to getting TPN).  Consider more broadly
   covering for fungal organisms if not improving.
   - If no change tomorrow, will start to peel off abx
   - R/o flu
   - Continue to hold lisinopril and restart low dose metoprolol
   - Hold TPN for now and will DC PICC line; will hold TPN alltogether for
   now.
   - DC PICC line; CVL for continued monitoring and med administration
   given tenuous status.
   .
   # Tachypnea.  Elevated respiratory rates though good sats and PaO2 on
   only 2 L.  Sepsis vs. fever vs. metabolic acidosis vs. pulmonary edema
   vs. further clot burden.
   - Repeat VBG
   - Monitor respiratory status
   - Closely monitor volume status - will hold further diuretics for now
   and give 1L bolus given evidence of volume depletion on exam (dry MM,
   low JVD, very collapsable veins on US).
   - Continuation of anticoagulation.
   - Fever control.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Most likely related to systemic infection/sepsis.  Does
   arouse and oriented to place without clear focal findings.  Is
   anticoagulated though no trauma and more suggestive of global process -
   head bleed less likely.  Per floor team, mental status has been waxing
   and [**Doctor Last Name 226**].
   - Management of sepsis as above.
   - Consider head CT as above.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Had evidence of ileus vs. SBO, now resolved and with
   diarrhea.  Recent chemo likely contributing.  Consideration for
   infectious etiology as above.
   - Hold loperamide, octreotide.
   - Resending stool cultures/c.diff though with two negatives unlikely.
   - Empiric flagyl for now.
   - Aggressive repletion of electrolytes.
   .
   # Pancytopenia.  Likely chemo related.  Concern that had increased
   chemo effect given timing.
   - continue to monitor counts.
   - continue gcsf.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy.  Cardiology consulted, Takusubo's vs. effects of
   chemo (coronary vasospasm).  Less likely CAD.  Mildly volume overloaded
   on exam.
   - Repeat TTE as above.
   - hold diuretics for now.
   - Hold lisinopril and metoprolol right now, with continuation tomorrow
   if BPs remain stable.
   - Continue ASA and statin.

   # PE.  Patient with bilateral PEs and right heart strain with RV
   hypokinesis noted on initial TTE but considered poor thrombolytic
   candidate given malignancy.
   - anticoagulation with heparin.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. She has a history of malignancy and is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, which was later removed and cultured due to the presence of a central venous catheter-related infection. The patient also had an increase in temperature, tachycardia, and hypotension.

She is receiving multiple antibiotics, including flagyl, cefepime, vancomycin, fluconazole, and acyclovir, as well as supportive medications like heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 113/59 to 98/48 mmHg, heart rate between 107-137 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 9-10 mmHg.

The patient's blood culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a possible Staphylococcus infection. The urine culture reveals the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These findings indicate potential bloodstream and urinary tract infections.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, elevated troponin-T levels, and elevated lactate levels. The renal function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles on auscultation of the chest and poor peripheral pulses. Neurologic assessment is not available.

Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, pulmonary embolism, hypotension, pain control, dyspnea, and cancer. The patient requires ongoing ICU care with attention to glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   with 10-100,000 pseudomonas. Patient with febrile upon transfer,
   tachycardia, and tachypnea.  Now neutropenic as result of chemo.  Blood
   cultures just turning positive, though is only [**11-28**] - some possibility
   that this is not the source and is only contaminant.  PICC line in
   place and gets TPN.  Other possible sources include urine (UA positive
   yesterday), GI given profuse diarrhea (C.diff negative), infected
   ascites (though malignant - unlikely SBP), pulmonary (though nothing
   yet on CXR).  Viral also possible.  Must consider fungemia given TPN
   use.  Sepsis complicated by neutropenia from chemo and possibility that
   patient may have increased chemo effect given mild renal insufficiency
   at time of dosing (given very early neutropenia).
   - Repeat blood cultures.
   - Viral panel - nasal swab
   - f/u existing cultures.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - TTE today/tomorrow to eval for vegetations.
   - Check lactate and central venous sat now.
   - Antibiotics: very broad for now covering blood/line infection, GI and
   urinary sources, flagyl for ?Cdiff.  Also getting acyclovir and
   fluconazole (was started on fluc for ?candidal rash but keeping on more
   due to getting TPN).  Consider more broadly covering for fungal
   organisms if not improving.
   - Hold lisinopril and metorprolol for now given concern for impending
   shock.
   - Hold TPN for now and will DC PICC line; will hold TPN alltogether for
   now.
   - DC PICC line; CVL for continued monitoring and med administration
   given tenuous status.

   # Tachypnea.  Elevated respiratory rates though good sats and PaO2 on
   only 2 L.  Sepsis vs. fever vs. metabolic acidosis vs. pulmonary edema
   vs. further clot burden.
   - VBG.
   - Closely monitor volume status - will hold further diuretics for now
   and give 1L bolus given evidence of volume depletion on exam (dry MM,
   low JVD, very collapsable veins on US).
   - Continuation of anticoagulation.
   - Fever control.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Most likely related to systemic infection/sepsis.  Does
   arouse and oriented to place without clear focal findings.  Is
   anticoagulated though no trauma and more suggestive of global process -
   head bleed less likely.  Per floor team, mental status has been waxing
   and [**Doctor Last Name 226**].
   - Management of sepsis as above.
   - Consider head CT as above.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Had evidence of ileus vs. SBO, now resolved and with
   diarrhea.  Recent chemo likely contributing.  Consideration for
   infectious etiology as above.
   - Hold loperamide, octreotide.
   - Resending stool cultures/c.diff though with two negatives unlikely.
   - Empiric flagyl for now.
   - Aggressive repletion of electrolytes.
   .
   # Pancytopenia.  Likely chemo related.  Concern that had increased
   chemo effect given timing.
   - continue to monitor counts.
   - continue gcsf.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy.  Cardiology consulted, Takusubo's vs. effects of
   chemo (coronary vasospasm).  Less likely CAD.  Mildly volume overloaded
   on exam.
   - Repeat TTE as above.
   - hold diuretics for now.
   - Hold lisinopril and metoprolol right now, with continuation tomorrow
   if BPs remain stable.
   - Continue ASA and statin.
   .
   # PE.  Patient with bilateral PEs and right heart strain with RV
   hypokinesis noted on initial TTE but considered poor thrombolytic
   candidate given malignancy.
   - anticoagulation with heparin.
   .
   # Serous ovarian adenocarcinoma.  Recent [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol with upcoming
   plans for surgical intervention.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of newly diagnosed ovarian adenocarcinoma, bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, and now admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and concern for impending shock. The patient's chief complaint is neutropenic fever. 

24-hour events include the patient having a fever, sending blood and urine cultures, discontinuing flagyl as third C. diff came back negative, restarting beta-blockers due to persistent tachycardia, and performing a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing improved systolic function without vegetations.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 125/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has decreased from 79.3 kg to 82.8 kg since admission.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's physical examination reveals an elderly woman in mild distress but looks better than yesterday, alert and oriented, tachycardic with no heave or jugular venous distention, and clear to auscultation of the chest.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever.
- She has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, fever, neutropenia, diarrhea, alteration in nutrition, acute pulmonary embolism, pain control, dyspnea, and cancer.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 125/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.
- The patient has been receiving various medications and infusions, including heparin sodium, fluconazole, metronidazole, vancomycin, cefepime, and acyclovir.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 4 mmHg, total fluid intake of 4,543 mL, and total fluid output of 2,470 mL.
- Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, with an ABG result of //22/.
- Physical examination findings are largely unassessed due to the patient's condition.
- Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 0.6 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 77 K/uL.
- The patient's WBC count has fluctuated over the past few days, with values ranging from 13.1 to 14.1 K/uL.
- Other lab results show elevated troponin T levels, abnormal liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient's nutritional status is being managed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.
- The patient is on full code status and her disposition is currently unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics indicates the possibility of bacterial infection, which may lead to sepsis if not effectively managed.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism, which can cause respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Monitoring oxygen saturation and ensuring adequate respiratory support is essential to prevent further complications.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias. Close monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate, is crucial.
4. Neutropenia: The patient's low neutrophil count makes her susceptible to infections and increases the risk of sepsis. Frequent monitoring of blood counts and prompt treatment of any signs"

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of ovarian adenocarcinoma, cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, and bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PE). She was transferred back to the ICU for febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and concern for impending shock. The patient's chief complaint is neutropenic fever. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 C (101 F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 125/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is tachycardic and has a borderline normal left ventricular systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction of 50-55%. 

The patient has received various antibiotics and antiviral medications. Her blood cultures have grown coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant. The urine culture showed 10-100,000 colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to multiple antibiotics including cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tobramycin. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.4 K/uL and neutropenia with a neutrophil count of 0"

   The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular cavity
   is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
   valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No
   mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No echocardiographic evidence of
   endocarditis but technically limited study. Borderline normal left
   ventricular systolic function. Resting tachycardia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a chief complaint of diarrhea, fever, and dyspnea.
- She has a history of gynecological cancer.
- She is currently in the ICU for further management.
- She has been experiencing persistent tachycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 112 to 148 bpm.
- Her blood pressure is within normal range.
- She has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, blood transfusion, and medication for mucositis.
- She has shown some improvement in her condition but still has ongoing symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's echocardiogram shows borderline normal left ventricular systolic function and mild thickening of the aortic and mitral valve leaflets. This could indicate early signs of cardiomyopathy or valvular disease.
2. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and adjust the antibiotic therapy accordingly.
3. Neutropenia: The patient's low absolute neutrophil count indicates neutropenia, which increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring and prompt treatment of any signs of infection are necessary.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be a result of her underlying condition, medication side effects, or an infection. It is important to manage her fluid and electrolyte balance carefully.

   The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular cavity
   is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall

   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
   valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No
   mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a diagnosis of ovarian adenocarcinoma, bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, and other medical conditions. She was transferred back to the ICU for febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and concern for impending shock. The patient is currently receiving treatment for sepsis/febrile neutropenia, tachypnea, sinus tachycardia, lethargy, diarrhea, pancytopenia, cardiomyopathy, PE, and skin breakdown. She has a history of recent chemotherapy and is scheduled for surgical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/febrile neutropenia: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis and febrile neutropenia. It is important to monitor her blood cultures and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Tachypnea: The patient has elevated respiratory rates, which could be due to a PE. It is important to continue monitoring her respiratory status and maintain anticoagulation.
3. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia may be multifactorial, secondary to acute illness and diarrhea. Monitoring and continuing metoprolol therapy are recommended.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has borderline normal left ventricular systolic function, and the cause of cardiomyopathy is unclear. Cardiology consultation has"

   Imaging: Echo:
   The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular cavity
   is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
   valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No
   mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No echocardiographic evidence of
   endocarditis but technically limited study. Borderline normal left
   ventricular systolic function. Resting tachycardia.

   Imaging: Echo:
   The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular cavity
   is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
   valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No
   mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No echocardiographic evidence of
   endocarditis but technically limited study. Borderline normal left
   ventricular systolic function. Resting tachycardia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of newly diagnosed ovarian adenocarcinoma and bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PE). She has been admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and concern for impending shock. She is also being treated for diarrhea, cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, and pain control. Other medical conditions include pancytopenia likely related to chemotherapy, skin breakdown, and serous ovarian adenocarcinoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/febrile neutropenia: The patient's blood cultures showed growth of GNR and CNS, indicating a possible bacterial infection. She has already been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime and ciprofloxacin. Daily surveillance cultures are planned to monitor for any changes.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of bilateral PEs and right heart strain. She is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary, and anticoagulation should be continued.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has borderline normal left ventricular systolic function. Cardiology consultation is planned to further evaluate and manage her cardiomyopathy. Diuretics and lisinopril have been held, while metoprolol is continued.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of ovarian cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted to the ICU with neutropenic fever, SIRS, and pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI). She has multiple medical conditions including cardiomyopathy, fever, neutropenia, diarrhea, alteration in nutrition, PE, pain control, dyspnea, and cancer. The patient is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has multiple lines in place. She is on various medications for prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of neutropenic fever and pseudomonas UTI. She may be at risk for developing further infections due to her compromised immune system.
2. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT and PE. She may be at risk for developing additional thrombotic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure and compromised cardiac function.
4. Cancer: The patient has ovarian cancer, which can progress and spread to other parts of the body, leading to complications related to metastasis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a female with a history of ovarian cancer and current symptoms including neutropenia, fever, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 114 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 144/80 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits at 23 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.

The patient has been receiving various medications including octreotide for diarrhea, antibiotics such as cefepime and ciprofloxacin for an infection, and antivirals like acyclovir. She is also receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition) with lipids.

The patient's physical examination reveals mucositis in the mouth, edema in both lower extremities, and clear breath sounds on respiratory examination. Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/uL and neutropenia with a neutrophil count of 0.5 K/uL. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated at 1.7 mg/dL.

Radiological imaging shows a possible early left basilar infiltrate on the chest X-ray, which suggests the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. A repeat chest X-ray has been recommended.

The patient's medical complications include cardiomyopathy, fever, neutropenia, diarrhea, alteration in nutrition,"

   ICU Attending Note
   I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU team on morning
   rounds.  The assessment and plan was discussed in detail and summarized
   above. I agree with the assessment and plan and would emphasize the
   following.
   Sitting up in chair this am.  Notes dry mouth, no SOB.  Minimal cough
   with some white phlegm else no respiratory complaints.
   Hemodynamically stable  Lungs with mininal crackles at bases albeit
   seem to clears somewhat with deep breathing.  2+ bipedal  edema
   GNR in blood, not yet speciated.  Pansensitive Pseudamonas in urine.
   CXR:  no clear inflitrates
   Agree with stopping vanco.  On double gram negative coverage, suspect
   organism in blood will be same as that in urine culutre.  Patient
   clinically improved.
   Detailed assessment and plan as above.
   Patient stable for tranfer back to the medical floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of ovarian cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and concern for impending shock. She has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, and is currently being treated for GNR bacteremia, diarrhea/mucositis, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has GNR bacteremia and is on double coverage antibiotics (cefepime and ciprofloxacin) due to the suspected growth of pan-sensitive pseudomonas in her urine culture. There is a potential risk of developing a multi-drug resistant infection if the current treatment is not effective.

2. PE/Right Heart Strain: The patient has bilateral PEs and right heart strain with RV hypokinesis. She is on heparin drip to prevent further clot formation. If the clotting continues or worsens, it could lead to right-sided heart failure or other complications.

3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has an improved ejection fraction (EF) but still has cardiomyopathy. If her cardiac function deteriorates, it may impact her overall organ perfusion and lead to complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

4. Malignancy: The patient has ovarian cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. There is a risk of disease progression or recurrence, which could affect her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of ovarian cancer, presenting with neutropenia, fever, and sepsis. She has been transferred back to the ICU for further management. The patient's current medications include cefepime, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, acyclovir, octreotide, and heparin. She has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiomyopathy, and serous ovarian adenocarcinoma. The patient's condition has been improving, with stable vital signs and no acute distress. She is still experiencing diarrhea and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fever indicate an increased risk of infection. The presence of GNR bacteria in the blood and urine suggests a possible bacterial infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent or treat any potential infections.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism, which is a serious condition where blood clots block the arteries in the lungs. Heparin drip has been initiated to prevent further clot formation, but close monitoring and consideration of further management by the primary team are essential.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy may be exacerbated by her underlying conditions and medications. It is important to continue aspirin, simvastatin,"
