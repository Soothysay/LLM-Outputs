   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 896**] is a 63 yo F with recent admission for ETOH pancreatitis
   admitted with acute altered mental status and fever.
   .
   #sepsis-  Patient found to have gram positive cocci in blood.  The most
   likely source of infection seems to be the PICC line that was d/c
   yesterday.  PICC tip being cultured.  Other sources could be C.diff
   given that she has had persistant diarrhea and recent
   antibiotics/hospitalization.  Pancreatic abscess/pseudocyst also
   possible given recent severe pancreatitis.
   -cover with broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, levofloxacin
   and flagyl for now to cover most likely sources being PICC, C.diff or
   GI tract.  Will likely d/c levo and flagyl after obtaining abdominal
   ultrasound.
   -f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures, CSF cultures
   -check LFT's/amylase/lipase
   -check ABD ultrasound to evaluate prelim for pancreatic abscess
   -tylenol prn for fevers, cooling blankets
   .
   # respiratory failure
 intubated for tachypnea and concern re:
   respiratory fatigue.  Will lighten sedation and hope to extubate later
   today.  RISB 35 and patient is doing well on PSV 5/5
   .
   #Altered Mental Status -most likely SIRS given high spiking fevers.  LP
   in ED without evidence of bacterial or HSV meningitis.  Encephalitis or
   aseptic meningitis possible.  Other possibility is non-convulsive
   status epilepticus.  She had head CT that was unremarkable on admission
   with no focal or localizing signs on neuro exam.  Tox screen negative
   except for benzos given in the ED.
   -Neurology consult
   -likely EEG
   -avoid sedating medications if possible
   -treat infection as above
   .
   #recent ETOH pancreatitis - no evidence of recurrance given normal
   amylase/lipase, pancreatic psudocyst is a possibility.
   -abdominal u/s in the am to evaluate for cyst in pancreas
   -consider Abd CT to further evaluate if indicated
   .
   #h/o ETOH abuse - no recent ETOH x 1 month
   -hold off on benzo's for now
   .
   #Depression - on seroquel and effexor as an outpatient, neither are new
   medications for her.
   -hold seroquel and effexor for now
   -check CK to evaluate for possible NMS
   .
   #FEN - d/c maintenance fluids, replete lytes prn, NPO
 continue for
   now.  Start TF later today if not extubated.

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 896**] is a 63 yo F with recent admission for ETOH pancreatitis
   admitted with acute altered mental status and fever.
   .
   #SIRS- she meets criteria for SIRS given her high spiking fevers,
   tachycardia, and leukocytosis, likely sepsis given most likely
   underlying cause is infection given her elevated WBC and fevers.  Most
   likely sources of infection could be PICC line or GI tract such as
   C.diff given that she has had persistant diarrhea and recent
   antibiotics/hospitalization.  Pancreatic abscess/pseudocyst also
   possible given recent severe pancreatitis.  She had LP in the ED
   without evidence of bacterial or HSV meningitis.  Aseptic/viral
   meningitis or encephalitis is possible.  She also has a possible
   infiltrate on CXR.  Hypertension less supportive of sepsis and suggests
   possibility of other cause such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome or
   thyrotoxicosis.
   -check TSH, CK

   #Altered Mental Status - most likely due to toxic metabolic process,
   most likely SIRS given high spiking fevers.  LP in ED without evidence
   of bacterial or HSV meningitis.  Encephalitis or aseptic meningitis
   possible.  Other possibility is non-convulsive status epilepticus.  She

- The patient is a 63-year-old female with recent admission for ETOH pancreatitis.
- She was admitted with acute altered mental status and fever.
- The patient meets criteria for SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) due to high spiking fevers, tachycardia, and leukocytosis.
- The most likely cause of sepsis is infection, possibly from the PICC line or GI tract such as C. diff.
- She had a lumbar puncture in the emergency department that did not show evidence of bacterial or HSV meningitis.
- Possible causes for altered mental status include toxic metabolic process, SIRS, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, or non-convulsive status epilepticus.
- The patient has a history of ETOH abuse but has not consumed alcohol in the past month.
- She is currently being treated for suspected sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- Other potential diagnoses to consider include a pancreatic abscess or pseudocyst due to recent severe pancreatitis.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.4°F (39.7°C), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/61 mmHg to 165/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's high spiking fevers, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggest a possible septic state. If not managed promptly and appropriately, sepsis can progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or even death.

2. Infection: Given the suspicion of infection as the underlying cause of sepsis, it is important to promptly identify the source of infection. Possible sources include the PICC line, gastrointestinal tract (such as C. diff), or a pancreatic abscess/pseudocyst.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's acute altered mental status may be due to a toxic metabolic process, sepsis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, or non-convulsive status epilepticus. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the exact cause and provide appropriate treatment.

4. Pancreatic abscess/pseudocyst: The patient's recent severe pancreatitis raises the possibility of a pancreatic abscess or pseudocyst. This can lead to localized infection and systemic complications if not identified and managed appropriately.

5. Complications related to long-term alcohol abuse: Although the patient has not consumed alcohol in the past month, her history of ETOH abuse puts her at risk for various complications, including malnutrition, liver disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and an increased susceptibility to infections.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and testing may be required to confirm the diagnoses and determine the most appropriate course of action."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 896**] is a 63 yo F with recent admission for ETOH pancreatitis
   admitted with acute altered mental status and fever.
   .
   #sepsis-  Patient found to have gram positive cocci in blood.  The most
   likely source of infection seems to be the PICC line that was d/c
   yesterday.  PICC tip being cultured.  Other sources could be C.diff
   given that she has had persistant diarrhea and recent
   antibiotics/hospitalization.  Pancreatic abscess/pseudocyst also
   possible given recent severe pancreatitis.
   -cover with broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, levofloxacin
   and flagyl for now to cover most likely sources being PICC, C.diff or
   GI tract.  Will likely d/c levo and flagyl after obtaining abdominal
   ultrasound.
   -f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures, CSF cultures
   -check LFT's/amylase/lipase
   -check ABD ultrasound to evaluate prelim for pancreatic abscess
   -tylenol prn for fevers, cooling blankets
   .
   # respiratory failure
 intubated for tachypnea and concern re:
   respiratory fatigue.  Will lighten sedation and hope to extubate later
   today.  RISB 35 and patient is doing well on PSV 5/5
   .
   #Altered Mental Status -most likely SIRS given high spiking fevers.  LP
   in ED without evidence of bacterial or HSV meningitis.  Encephalitis or
   aseptic meningitis possible.  Other possibility is non-convulsive
   status epilepticus.  She had head CT that was unremarkable on admission
   with no focal or localizing signs on neuro exam.  Tox screen negative
   except for benzos given in the ED.
   -Neurology consult
   -likely EEG
   -avoid sedating medications if possible
   -treat infection as above
   .
   #recent ETOH pancreatitis - no evidence of recurrance given normal
   amylase/lipase, pancreatic psudocyst is a possibility.
   -abdominal u/s in the am to evaluate for cyst in pancreas
   -consider Abd CT to further evaluate if indicated
   .
   #h/o ETOH abuse - no recent ETOH x 1 month
   -hold off on benzo's for now
   .
   #Depression - on seroquel and effexor as an outpatient, neither are new
   medications for her.
   -hold seroquel and effexor for now
   -check CK to evaluate for possible NMS
   .
   #FEN - d/c maintenance fluids, replete lytes prn, NPO
 continue for
   now.  Start TF later today if not extubated.

- Patient is a 63-year-old female with recent admission for ETOH pancreatitis.
- Admitted with acute altered mental status and fever.
- Found to have gram-positive cocci in blood, likely from the PICC line.
- Possible sources of infection include C.diff, pancreatic abscess/pseudocyst.
- Covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl).
- Intubated for respiratory failure; plans to lighten sedation and extubate later today.
- Altered mental status possibly due to sepsis; neurology consult requested.
- Recent ETOH pancreatitis; possibility of pancreatic pseudocyst.
- History of ETOH abuse, depression, and use of seroquel and effexor.
- Code status: Full code.
- Currently on maintenance fluids, NPO, TF later today if not extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of gram-positive cocci in the blood suggests a bacterial infection, which can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk of further respiratory compromise and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
3. Pancreatic Abscess/Pseudocyst: Given the recent severe pancreatitis, there is a possibility of"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hemochromatosis and alcohol abuse, presenting with septic shock due to coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in the blood. She also has a new diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 100%. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals no pulses in the right radial, left radial, right distal phalanx (DP), and left DP. The skin examination is not assessed, and the neurologic examination shows that the patient responds to commands but movement, tone, and assessment are not evaluated. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 28.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 582 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.7 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.03 ng/mL, total CO2 (TCO2) of 26 mmol/L, glucose of 179 mg/dL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hemochromatosis and alcohol abuse, presenting with septic shock due to coagulation-negative Staphylococcus infection in the blood. The infection is likely from a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient also has a newly diagnosed non-convulsive status epilepticus. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 58.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 13.5 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 582 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.03 ng/mL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 26 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal decreased opacity at the right base and an improving small left-sided pleural effusion on chest X-ray, as well as no evidence of pancreatic pseudocyst or intraabdominal pathology on abdominal ultrasound.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 896**] is a 63 yo F with recent admission for ETOH pancreatitis
   admitted with acute altered mental status and fever.
   .
   #sepsis-  Patient found to have gram positive cocci in blood.  The most
   likely source of infection seems to be the PICC line that was d/c
   yesterday.  PICC tip being cultured.  Other sources could be C.diff
   given that she has had persistant diarrhea and recent
   antibiotics/hospitalization.  Pancreatic abscess/pseudocyst also
   possible given recent severe pancreatitis.
   -cover with broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, levofloxacin
   and flagyl for now to cover most likely sources being PICC, C.diff or
   GI tract.  Will likely d/c levo and flagyl after obtaining abdominal
   ultrasound.
   -f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures, CSF cultures
   -check LFT's/amylase/lipase
   -check ABD ultrasound to evaluate prelim for pancreatic abscess
   -tylenol prn for fevers, cooling blankets
   .
   # respiratory failure
 intubated for tachypnea and concern re:
   respiratory fatigue.  Will lighten sedation and hope to extubate later
   today.  RISB 35 and patient is doing well on PSV 5/5
   .
   #Altered Mental Status -most likely SIRS given high spiking fevers.  LP
   in ED without evidence of bacterial or HSV meningitis.  Encephalitis or
   aseptic meningitis possible.  Other possibility is non-convulsive
   status epilepticus.  She had head CT that was unremarkable on admission
   with no focal or localizing signs on neuro exam.  Tox screen negative
   except for benzos given in the ED.
   -Neurology consult
   -likely EEG
   -avoid sedating medications if possible
   -treat infection as above
   .
   #recent ETOH pancreatitis - no evidence of recurrance given normal
   amylase/lipase, pancreatic psudocyst is a possibility.
   -abdominal u/s in the am to evaluate for cyst in pancreas
   -consider Abd CT to further evaluate if indicated
   .
   #h/o ETOH abuse - no recent ETOH x 1 month
   -hold off on benzo's for now
   .
   #Depression - on seroquel and effexor as an outpatient, neither are new
   medications for her.
   -hold seroquel and effexor for now
   -check CK to evaluate for possible NMS
   .
   #FEN - d/c maintenance fluids, replete lytes prn, NPO
 continue for
   now.  Start TF later today if not extubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mrs. [Known Lastname 896], a 63-year-old female, was admitted with acute altered mental status and fever. She has a history of recent admission for ethanol (ETOH) pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 102.0°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 421 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. She is also receiving sedation with midazolam and fentanyl.

The patient has multiple medical issues, including sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and a history of ETOH abuse. She has been found to have gram-positive cocci in her blood culture, most likely from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, which was discontinued yesterday. Other potential sources of infection include Clostridium difficile (C. diff) due to persistent diarrhea and recent antibiotic use/hospitalization, as well as a possible pancreatic abscess or pseudocyst due to recent severe pancreatitis.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC),"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hemochromatosis and ETOH abuse, admitted to the ICU with sepsis, GPC septic shock, and newly diagnosed non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient's temperature has been consistently high, with a maximum recorded at 103.6°F. Blood cultures have shown coag-negative Staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant since the PICC line is not growing anything. The patient has a large pancreatic fluid collection, but no evidence of pseudoaneurysm formation. There are also focal right upper lobe opacities, which may represent patchy areas of pneumonia. The patient's mental status and renal function have improved, but she remains febrile despite antibiotics. The WBC count is down, but the patient still has a fever. The patient has respiratory failure and is currently on CPAP/PSV with a Vt of 360 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.21 and a lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. The patient has anemia with a Hct of 23%, but no signs of bleeding. The patient also has C. difficile colitis, for which she is being treated empirically with IV flagyl."

   ECHO REPORT [**2138-5-28**]
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace
   aortic regurgitation may be present (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-5-19**], the
   findings are similar.
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   Based on [**2136**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo
   findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions
   regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
   echocardiographic data.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hemochromatosis and ETOH abuse, who was admitted with septic shock and newly diagnosed non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient has been improving clinically but remains febrile on antibiotics. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). The C-reactive protein (CRP) is elevated, indicating inflammation or infection. Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a large pancreatic pseudocyst, which could be a potential source of infection, as well as focal right upper lobe opacities suggestive of pneumonia. There is also evidence of bilateral pleural effusions, likely secondary to the infection.

The patient's current assessment and plan include continuing vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for suspected bacterial infection, including coverage for anaerobic infection in the pseudocyst. Consultation with surgery, interventional radiology (IR), and gastroenterology (GI) is recommended to evaluate drainage options for the pseudocyst. Repeat cultures and surveillance are also advised.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's large pleural effusions and area of possible consolidation raise concerns for"

   Prelim read-  Interval development of pancreatic body necrosis. Large
   pseudocyst
   without evidence of pseudoaneurysm formation.
   Focal right upper lobe opacities may represent patchy areas of
   pneumonia.
   Interval improvement in the bilateral pleural effusions with residual
   adjacent
   atelectasis.
   ECHO REPORT [**2138-5-28**]
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace
   aortic regurgitation may be present (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-5-19**], the
   findings are similar.
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   Based on [**2136**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo
   findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions
   regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
   echocardiographic data.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hemochromatosis and alcohol abuse, currently diagnosed with septic shock, non-convulsive status epilepticus, and a large pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient's WBC count is trending down but remains febrile on antibiotics. The patient also has bilateral pulmonary effusions, which could be due to pneumonia or empyema. The patient's mental status and renal function have improved, but they are still febrile and on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected Pancreatic Pseudocyst: The patient has a large pancreatic pseudocyst that could be a source of infection, leading to ongoing fevers despite antibiotic treatment.
2. Pneumonia/Emphysema: The patient has bilateral pulmonary effusions, which may indicate pneumonia or empyema. This could potentially lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
3. Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (NCSE): The patient is newly diagnosed with NCSE, which requires further evaluation and management to control seizures.
4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently being managed with non-invasive ventilation but may require intubation and mechanical ventilation if there is a deterioration in their respiratory function.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has evidence of pre-renal azotemia, likely secondary to septic shock. Close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hemochromatosis and alcohol abuse, presenting with septic shock, newly diagnosed non-convulsive status epilepticus, and a pancreatic pseudocyst. She underwent CT-guided aspiration of the pseudocyst, with fluid gram stain being negative. The patient has been improving clinically, but continues to have fevers despite receiving antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of a pancreatic pseudocyst raises the possibility of infection. The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infectious process. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to control the infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has large pleural effusions and an area of possible consolidation seen on CT. This could indicate pneumonia or empyema, which can lead to respiratory failure. Thoracentesis may be considered if the pseudocyst aspiration is non-diagnostic.

3. Renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible renal dysfunction. This could be due to pre-renal azotemia in the setting of shock. Close monitoring and volume repletion are recommended.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level has decreased from 28% on admission to 22-23%. This may be due to dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation or ongoing bleeding. Frequent blood monitoring and type and crossmatching should be performed.

She has been improving clinically but recently found to have a pancreatic pseudocyst as a possible source of infection. The patient underwent CT-guided aspiration of her pancreatic pseudocyst, and the fluid gram stain was negative. Cultures are pending.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Her vital signs show hypertension, but her blood pressure is currently controlled with amlodipine. She also has anemia with a Hct of 22-23%, likely due to chronic disease or blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of VRE colonization.

She is currently on precautions for VRE and swabbing is being done appropriately. The patient's renal function is improving, and she is no longer febrile. Mental status is improving, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's pancreatic pseudocyst could potentially become infected, leading to an abscess or empyema.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's previous septic shock episode, there is a risk of recurrence if the infection spreads or if new pathogens are introduced.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hemochromatosis and alcohol abuse, who presented with septic shock and was diagnosed with non-convulsive status epilepticus. She has been improving clinically but was found to have a pancreatic pseudocyst, which could be a source of infection. The patient underwent CT-guided aspiration of the pseudocyst, and the fluid gram stain was negative. She is currently on multiple antibiotics to cover possible infections. The patient's mental status and renal function have improved, but she still has fevers and may have an infected pseudocyst or empyema. Further management includes obtaining an MRI of the brain to evaluate for an infectious focus, repeating cultures, and continuing on precautions due to her history of VRE.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected Pancreatic Pseudocyst: The patient's pancreatic pseudocyst could be infected, leading to ongoing fevers and potential sepsis.
2. Empyema: The patient has bilateral pulmonary effusion seen on CT, raising the possibility of an empyema, which is a collection of pus in the pleural space.
3. Non-convulsive Status Epilepticus: The patient was diagnosed with non-convulsive status epilepticus, indicating ongoing seizure activity that requires close monitoring and management.
4. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is currently improving but may still be compromised due to pre-renal azot"

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hemochromatosis and alcohol abuse, who presented with septic shock and was diagnosed with non-convulsive status epilepticus. She has also been found to have a pancreatic pseudocyst on CT scan. The source of infection is unknown. The patient has been receiving antibiotics and other medications for her condition. Her fever has resolved overnight, and she is showing improvement clinically. However, she still requires further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected Pancreatic Pseudocyst: The presence of a pancreatic pseudocyst can lead to infection, which may be causing the patient's symptoms. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or abscess formation.
2. Bilateral Pulmonary Effusion: The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary effusion, which can potentially lead to complications such as pneumonia or empyema. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to assess the severity and progression of this condition.
3. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are crucial to prevent further deterioration.

   Imaging: MRI ([**2138-5-31**])-
   FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:
   Since the previous MRI examination of [**2138-1-20**], new multiple confluent
   areas of
   T2 hyperintensity are seen in the subcortical white matter of both
   frontal,
   parietal and occipital lobes as well as involvement of the temporal
   lobes.
   Again seen are changes of small vessel disease identified on the
   previous MRI
   examination. Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy is identified. Following
   gadolinium no abnormal enhancement is seen. There is no hydrocephalus
   or
   midline shift.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Findings are indicative of a posterior reversible encephalopathy
   with
   diffuse changes in all cerebral lobes as described above. These
   findings are
   superimposed on previously noted small vessel disease.
   2. Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy.
   3. No evidence of abnormal enhancement to suggest mass or underlying
   abscess.
   No abnormal meningeal enhancement.
   MRA OF THE HEAD:
   Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of
   anterior and
   posterior circulation. A slight protuberance at the origin of right
   posterior
   cerebral artery from the basilar artery appears to be due to an
   infundibulum.
   IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRA of the head.
   Microbiology: Blood cx - Coag neg staph in [**11-25**] cx.
   Panc - gm stain neg, no bacterial growth to date. KOH - no fungus seen.
   CSF - neg virus & bacteria
   C-diff neg.  O&P neg
   PICC neg.
   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F h/o hemochromatosis, ETOH abuse a/w septic shock, newly
   diagnosed non-convulsive status epilepticus who is improving
   clinically, recently found to pancreatic pseudocyst on CT as another
   possible source of infection.
   #SIRS/sepsis-  Mental status and renal function improved.  She does not
   seem to have a bacteremia.  The coag neg staph in blood thought to be
   likely contaminant as only growing in [**11-24**] bottles.  The PICC line cx
   has had NGTD.  Infected/necrotic pseudocyst is possible explanation for
   her infection.  The gram stain and cultures are negative, but it was
   sampled after several days of ABX.  Overall, we do not have a definite
   cause of her SIRS.
   -cont. levofloxacin and flagyl to cover for possible bowel anaerobic
   infection in pseudocyst. (course 2 weeks)
   -Follow up with GI and [**Doctor First Name **] re: further management of pseudocyst.
   Surgery states CT A/P in approx 1 month post discharge and either
   follow up as outpatient with GI or [**Doctor First Name **].
   -MRI shows no infectious focus.
   -cx if spikes
   -tylenol (<2 g/d), cooling blanket PRN fever
   -would avoid demerol for rigors as may be epileptogenic
   -f/u Cx data, spec/sensitivities
   -continue on precautions for hx of VRE + swabs.
   #Fever
afebrile x2 days.  Possibly secondary to infected pseudocyst.
   other considerations include PNA, cerebral pathology.
   -cont. levoquin and flagyl.
   -repeat Cx, f/u spec/[**Last Name (un) 270**]
   #Mental status/NCSE:
   -MRI of brain today
shows changes consistent with toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   -f/u with neuro re: video EEG today results
   -cont. keppra
   -f/u neuro recs
   #HTN
 poor control with SBPs remain in the 160-170s
   -change amlodipine to home dose of 7.5 mg PO daily
   -increase metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   #ARF
 likely pre-renal azotemia
 resolving Cr. 1.2
   - renally dose vancomycin and levofloxacin.  If Cr drops further may
   need to adjust doses.
   #Anemia

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of hemochromatosis and ETOH abuse, presenting with septic shock and newly diagnosed non-convulsive status epilepticus. She has shown improvement clinically and has been found to have a pancreatic pseudocyst on CT after a recent episode of pancreatitis. The source of infection is unclear.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/90 to 109/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's mental status has improved, and she is able to focus attention more.

Laboratory results show white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 582 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 179 mg/dL, and sodium level of 142 mEq/L.

Imaging reveals multiple confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter of both frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, as well as involvement of the temporal lobes. This is indicative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) with diffuse changes in all cerebral lobes. No evidence of abnormal enhancement or underlying abscess"
