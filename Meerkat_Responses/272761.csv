196864.0,272761,2131-07-11 19:11:00,Physician ,Physician Attending Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: Bradycardia, syncope, hypotension
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Patient had elective hernia repair yesterday. Post-op exprienced
   syncope with a HR reported of 30-40. Was observed overnight in the
   hospital. This AM, BP dropped gradually and had a witnessed loss of
   consciousness for about 20 seconds. HR had dropped with a 15 sec pause
   after sinus brady; came out of this with sinus bradycardia.
   Denied chest pain. Had some nausea and diaphoresis. Was transferred to
   the ICU.
   In the ICU, has been in sinus bradycardia without additional symptoms.
   Patient had syncopal episode an airplane several months ago. No beta
   blockers or calcium blockers in his med list.
   Cardiac enzymes  negative X 2.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   BRADYCARDIA
   HYPOTENSION
   ===============================
   Patient with documented sinus arrest with hx that is suggestive of
   vasovagal syncope. Given the frequency and severity of the episodes, I
   suspect the patient will required a pacemaker. It is possible, however,
   that if there is significant vasodiation as part of these episodes,
   pacemaker alone is not always sufficient to prevent the hypotension.
   Continue to monitor closely overnight. ASA started. Will place
   transcutaneous pacer pads.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and post-operative hernia repair who experienced a syncopal episode on the surgical floor. He was transferred to the ICU for continuous cardiac monitoring. The patient has been diagnosed with bradycardia and an episode of asystole, which may be related to sick sinus syndrome. The plan is to consult with the electrophysiology (EP) team to further evaluate and manage this condition.

The patient is currently on several medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, famotidine, ASA 325mg (if approved by surgery), and lipitor for hyperlipidemia. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 124/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.3°C.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. However, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is slightly elevated at 26 mg/dL. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits.

An echocardiogram was performed, which revealed no structural cardiac cause of syncope. There is mild symmetric left"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of heart disease and post-operative hernia repair who experienced a syncopal episode on the surgical floor. He was transferred to the ICU for continuous cardiac monitoring due to a second bradycardic syncopal episode. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 124/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is comfortable, pleasant, and conversant.

The patient's lab results show normal levels for white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. The creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.9, while the potassium level is within the normal range at 4.0 mg/dL. The magnesium level is also normal at 2.0 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The echocardiogram reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, no significant valvular abnormality, and no resting or inducible outflow tract obstruction.

The patient's assessment includes syncope, likely vasovagal syncope but cannot rule out sick sinus syndrome. The plan is for an electrophysiologist (EP) to see"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension and post-operative hernia repair syncopal episode. He was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a second bradycardic syncopal episode on the surgical floor. The patient's current condition is stable, with vital signs within normal range. He is comfortable, pleasant, conversant, and in no apparent distress.

The patient has been diagnosed with syncope, and the attending physician believes it is likely vasovagal syncope but cannot rule out a cardiac problem such as sick sinus syndrome. The electrophysiologist (EP) recommends pacemaker placement, but the patient is refusing the procedure. The risks and benefits of pacemaker placement were discussed with the patient, and he understands the options. The patient can be discharged home if he does not want a pacemaker with EP follow-up.

The patient also has a history of left hernia repair, which was complicated by post-operative syncope. He is currently in the ICU for cardiac monitoring due to mild hypoxia likely caused by atelectasis seen on chest X-ray. Incentive spirometry has been ordered for bedside use, and pain management with tylenol/oxycodone as needed has been prescribed.

The patient has other medical conditions, including hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and familial essential hypertension (FEN). He is advised to follow a regular diet modified for diabetes (DM), keep magnesium (M"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and post-operative hernia repair. He experienced a syncopal episode on the surgical floor, leading to transfer to the ICU for continuous cardiac monitoring.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%.
- Physical examination shows that the patient is comfortable, pleasant, and conversant. His lungs are clear, heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and there is tenderness over the surgical area.
- Laboratory results indicate normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelets, electrolytes, and liver enzymes. Renal function is also within normal limits.
- An echocardiogram revealed no structural cardiac cause for the patient's syncope. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function was observed, along with no significant valvular abnormality or outflow tract obstruction.
- The patient has been prescribed aspirin 325 mg daily and is receiving prophylactic heparin injections and famotidine.
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending recommendations from the electrophysiologist. If no pacemaker is recommended, the patient may be discharged home; otherwise, he will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with bradycardia and hypotension but is currently feeling well with no dizziness or palpitations. The patient has refused a pacemaker and will be arranged for cardiology follow-up. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/74 to 168/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal physical examination findings. Lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes, except for slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are a few potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate can lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate perfusion of vital organs. This may result in symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, or even loss of consciousness.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate blood flow to the organs, potentially causing organ damage. It can lead to symptoms such as fainting, confusion, or organ dysfunction.

3. Syncope: Although the patient is currently doing well without recurrent symptoms, syncope refers to sudden loss of consciousness due to a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain. It"
