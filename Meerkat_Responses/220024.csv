   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old male with CAD, aortic stenosis, VT/VF arrest s/p ICD and
   ablation, CHF (EF 20%) s/p BiV pacer, Afib on coumadin, CRI who
   presents after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.
   .
   # VT: Has a history of VT arrest. ICD interrogation today by cards
   fellow show 2 episodes of VT on [**3-30**] episodes on [**4-2**]. One of the
   latter episodes was shocked after failed ATP, although the other
   episodes were successfully converted with pacing.
   - EP aware of patient
   - Cont mexilitine and metoprolol
   - Keep Mg>2.0, K>4.5
   - Holding digoxin given concern that it may induce arrhythmia
   - Hold amiodarone for now, but if continues to have frequent VT, will
   start gtt.
   - If patient is getting frequent shocks, may need intubation and
   sedation for comfort. If this occurs, will call attending to discuss
   goals of care.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr around 1.6, currently
   3.5. Most likely from his lisinopril, as this was increased a few days
   prior to discharge, with his creatinine subsequently trending up to
   2.0. Also consider overdiuresis from furosemide and spironolcatone,
   although he had been on the meds for approximately 1 week before
   discharge with no change in renal function.
   - Replete fluids as above
   - Hold diuretics and ACE-I
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Chest wall pain: Has a history of CAD, although cardiac cath done
   during recent admission was clean. Does have mildly elevated
   biomarkers, although may be from ICD shock and renal failure. EKG shows
   a paced rhythm. He denies pain currently, although has had significant
   c/o pain after receiving CPR during his recent admission.
   - Cont scheduled tylenol
   - Would use MS IR if pain worsens (responded well in past)
   .
   # Anxiety: Has been acutely worsened since receiving multiple shocks
   during his last admission. At that time, he also had diaphoresis,
   episodes of lightheadedness and palpitations, as well as thinking his
   ICD had fired, despite normal vital signs and no telemetry changes.
   Patient appears calm currently, but may require reassurance.
   - Cont seroquel scheduled and PRN
   - Cont citalopram and clonazepam
   .
   # DVT: Located in LUE per US.
   - Cont warfarin with goal INR 2-2.5 (h/o GI bleed)
   - Continue PPI and sucralfate
   - F/u US in [**3-15**] mos
   .
   # Chronic Systolic heart Failure: LVEF 20% on TTE [**10-19**]. Also has known
   AS, although at last admission refused AVR and valvuloplasty. He
   currently is likely intravascularly dry given his ARF and exam.
   - IVF: NS at 100cc/hr for 500cc for gentle volume resuscitation
   - Cont metoprolol, holding digoxin as above
   - Hold diuretics for now
   .
   # Anemia: Chronic, normocytic. Hct stable at recent baseline of high
   20s to low 30s.
   - Trend hct.
   .
   # CAD: Stable, clean cath [**3-20**].
   - Continue aspirin, statin, beta blocker.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia/Hyponatremia: Mildly hyperkalemic and hyponatremic.
   Would expect hyperK to improve as his renal function improves, and
   would avoid aggressive rx given his propensity for arrhythmias and only
   mild elevation. Difficult to assess EKG given ventricular pacing.
   Hyponatremia is likely from diuresis, possibly as well as poor PO
   intake.
   - NPO for now in case requires intubation. Once taking POs, may need
   mild free water restriction if Na remains low.
   - NS as above
   - Repeat K this pm and tx if >5.5.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity (LUE). The patient presents after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to the frequent episodes of VT, which have resulted in multiple ICD shocks. He is being treated with amiodarone and lidocaine infusions. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 114/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and troponin-T. His electrolytes are mildly imbalanced, with hyperkalemia and hyponatremia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), heart failure (EF 20%) with biventricular pacing, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presents with recurrent episodes of VT, failure to pace out of VT, and inability of the defibrillator to control the arrhythmia. The patient has been intubated for comfort due to recurrent ICD shocks. He also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, possibly related to diuretics, lisinopril, and poor forward flow from VT. Other issues include chest wall pain from previous CPR and shocks, anxiety from repeated shocks, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity, chronic systolic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, known aortic stenosis, anemia, and hyperkalemia/hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent VT/VF: The patient's history of VT/VF arrest and failure to respond to antiarrhythmics suggests a high risk for further episodes of life-threatening arrhythmias.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old male with CAD, aortic stenosis, VT/VF arrest s/p ICD and
   ablation, CHF (EF 20%) s/p BiV pacer, Afib on coumadin, CRI who
   presents after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.
   .
   # VT: Recurrent Vtach and defibrillator unable to pace him out of it.
   Failed multiple antiarrythmics during past admissions.  Goals of care
   addressed overnight.  Plan to turn off defibrillator and keep patient
   comfortable.
   .
   # Intubation: For comfort in setting of recurrent ICD shocks.
   - Continue vent
   - Neo gtt
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr around 1.6, currently
   2.6.  Possibly from diuresis and lisinopril and poor forward flow from
   Vtach.
   - Hold diuretics and ACE-I
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Chest wall pain: From previous CPR and shocks.  Intubated now but
   will aim to keep patient comfortable once extubated.
   .
   # Anxiety:  From repeated shocks.
   - Cont seroquel scheduled and PRN
   - Cont citalopram and clonazepam
   .
   # DVT: Located in LUE per US.
   - Cont warfarin with goal INR 2-2.5 (h/o GI bleed)
   - Continue PPI and sucralfate
   - F/u US in [**3-15**] mos
   .
   # Chronic Systolic heart Failure: LVEF 20% on TTE [**10-19**]. Also has known
   AS, although at last admission refused AVR and valvuloplasty. He
   currently is likely intravascularly dry given his ARF and exam.
   - Gentle IVF.
   - Cont metoprolol, holding digoxin as above
   - Hold diuretics for now
   .
   # Anemia: Chronic, normocytic. Hct stable at recent baseline of high
   20s to low 30s.
   - Trend hct.
   .
   # CAD: Stable, clean cath [**3-20**].
   - Continue aspirin, statin, beta blocker
   .
   # Hyperkalemia/Hyponatremia: Likely from volume down.
   - NS as above
   - Monitor K
   .
   # Ppx: Therapeutic INR, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PICC
   .
   # Comm: [**Name (NI) 53**] and wife, [**Name (NI) 16**] [**Name (NI) 5730**]
   .
   # Code: For now, shocks and intubation okay, but no chest compressions.
   Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] has discussed this with the patient and his wife.  However,
   given hospital course, will have to readdress with plan to keep patient
   comfortable.

 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, SUSTAINED: refractory VT in the setting of
   end-stage cardiomyopathy, CAD and valvular disease
   - goals of care clearly stated by patient before intubation - he wants
   no CPR
   - because no viable options exist for long-term management of his
   arrhythmia and his overall severe heart disease, he and his family
   prefer that he be made comfortable

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia (VT) / ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and ablation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% post biventricular pacing (BiV pacer), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin, and chronic renal failure (CRI). He presents after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to recurrent ICD shocks and failed multiple antiarrhythmics during past admissions. The goals of care have been discussed with the patient and his wife, and it has been agreed upon to turn off the defibrillator and keep the patient comfortable.

The patient's medical complications include acute on chronic renal failure, chest wall pain from previous cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks, anxiety from repeated shocks, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity (LUE), chronic systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, anemia, CAD, hyperkalemia/hyponatremia, and prophylaxis for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   73 year old male with CAD, aortic stenosis, VT/VF arrest s/p ICD and
   ablation, CHF (EF 20%) s/p BiV pacer, Afib on coumadin, CRI who
   presents after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.
   .
   # VT: Recurrent Vtach and defibrillator unable to pace him out of it.
   Failed multiple antiarrythmics during past admissions.  Goals of care
   addressed overnight.  Plan to turn off defibrillator and keep patient
   comfortable.
   .
   # Intubation: For comfort in setting of recurrent ICD shocks.
   - Continue vent
   - Neo gtt
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr around 1.6, currently
   2.6.  Possibly from diuresis and lisinopril and poor forward flow from
   Vtach.
   - Hold diuretics and ACE-I
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Chest wall pain: From previous CPR and shocks.  Intubated now but
   will aim to keep patient comfortable once extubated.
   .
   # Anxiety:  From repeated shocks.
   - Cont seroquel scheduled and PRN
   - Cont citalopram and clonazepam
   .
   # DVT: Located in LUE per US.
   - Cont warfarin with goal INR 2-2.5 (h/o GI bleed)
   - Continue PPI and sucralfate
   - F/u US in [**3-15**] mos

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia, and chronic renal failure. He presents with multiple episodes of VT resulting in ICD shocks, intubation, and sedation. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic renal failure, chest wall pain from previous CPR and shocks, anxiety from repeated shocks, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, anemia, and hyperkalemia/hyponatremia. The patient has been placed on comfort measures only with a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient's refractory VT may lead to further episodes of arrhythmia, potentially resulting in hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. If not managed properly, this can lead to further deterioration of renal function and potentially life-threatening electrolyte imbalances.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of a DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening if it occurs.
4. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's LVEF of 20% indicates severe systolic dysfunction. Continued"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old male with CAD, aortic stenosis, VT/VF arrest s/p ICD and
   ablation, CHF (EF 20%) s/p BiV pacer, Afib on coumadin, CRI who
   presents after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.
   .
   # VT: Has a history of VT arrest. ICD interrogation today by cards
   fellow show 2 episodes of VT on [**3-30**] episodes on [**4-2**]. One of the
   latter episodes was shocked after failed ATP, although the other
   episodes were successfully converted with pacing.
   - EP aware of patient
   - Cont mexilitine and metoprolol
   - Keep Mg>2.0, K>4.5
   - Holding digoxin given concern that it may induce arrhythmia
   - Hold amiodarone for now, but if continues to have frequent VT, will
   start gtt.
   - If patient is getting frequent shocks, may need intubation and
   sedation for comfort. If this occurs, will call attending to discuss
   goals of care.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr around 1.6, currently
   3.5. Most likely from his lisinopril, as this was increased a few days
   prior to discharge, with his creatinine subsequently trending up to
   2.0. Also consider overdiuresis from furosemide and spironolcatone,
   although he had been on the meds for approximately 1 week before
   discharge with no change in renal function.
   - Replete fluids as above
   - Hold diuretics and ACE-I
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Chest wall pain: Has a history of CAD, although cardiac cath done
   during recent admission was clean. Does have mildly elevated
   biomarkers, although may be from ICD shock and renal failure. EKG shows
   a paced rhythm. He denies pain currently, although has had significant
   c/o pain after receiving CPR during his recent admission.
   - Cont scheduled tylenol
   - Would use MS IR if pain worsens (responded well in past)
   .
   # Anxiety: Has been acutely worsened since receiving multiple shocks
   during his last admission. At that time, he also had diaphoresis,
   episodes of lightheadedness and palpitations, as well as thinking his
   ICD had fired, despite normal vital signs and no telemetry changes.
   Patient appears calm currently, but may require reassurance.
   - Cont seroquel scheduled and PRN
   - Cont citalopram and clonazepam
   .
   # DVT: Located in LUE per US.
   - Cont warfarin with goal INR 2-2.5 (h/o GI bleed)
   - Continue PPI and sucralfate
   - F/u US in [**3-15**] mos
   .
   # Chronic Systolic heart Failure: LVEF 20% on TTE [**10-19**]. Also has known
   AS, although at last admission refused AVR and valvuloplasty. He
   currently is likely intravascularly dry given his ARF and exam.
   - IVF: NS at 100cc/hr for 500cc for gentle volume resuscitation
   - Cont metoprolol, holding digoxin as above
   - Hold diuretics for now
   .
   # Anemia: Chronic, normocytic. Hct stable at recent baseline of high
   20s to low 30s.
   - Trend hct.
   .
   # CAD: Stable, clean cath [**3-20**].
   - Continue aspirin, statin, beta blocker.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia/Hyponatremia: Mildly hyperkalemic and hyponatremic.
   Would expect hyperK to improve as his renal function improves, and
   would avoid aggressive rx given his propensity for arrhythmias and only
   mild elevation. Difficult to assess EKG given ventricular pacing.
   Hyponatremia is likely from diuresis, possibly as well as poor PO
   intake.
   - NPO for now in case requires intubation. Once taking POs, may need
   mild free water restriction if Na remains low.
   - NS as above
   - Repeat K this pm and tx if >5.5.

The patient presented after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.

1. VT/VF: The patient has a history of VT arrest and recent episodes of VT, indicating an increased risk for recurrent arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring and management of the ICD are necessary to prevent further episodes.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was around 1.6, but it has increased to 3.5. This could be due to medications such as lisinopril, overdiuresis, or other factors. Replete fluids, holding diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and avoiding nephrotoxins are recommended.
3. Chest wall pain: The patient has a history of CAD, but recent cardiac catheterization was clean. Elevated biomarkers may be due to ICD shock or renal failure. Pain management with scheduled Tylenol and MS IR if needed is advised.

   73 year old male with CAD, aortic stenosis, VT/VF arrest s/p ICD and
   ablation, CHF (EF 20%) s/p BiV pacer, Afib on coumadin, CRI who
   presents after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.
   Goals of care: Patient had frequent episodes of vtach and multiple ICD
   shocks at time of admission. Goals of care have been addressed in
   detail between patient, wife, and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. It was decided yesterday
   to turn off the ICD and stop all meds other than fetnanyl/midazolam for
   comfort.
   VT: ICD off and pt off all meds. No recurrences of  vtach overnight. If
   remains free of arrhythmias for another day, will readdress plan with
   family and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - patient has not had arrythmias since ICD function turned off

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and ablation, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% following biventricular pacing (BiV pacer), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI).

The patient presented with recent discharge and multiple episodes of VT. The ICD was unable to pace him out of it, and he failed multiple antiarrhythmics during past admissions. The goals of care were addressed overnight, and the plan is to turn off the defibrillator and keep the patient comfortable.

The patient is currently intubated for comfort due to recurrent ICD shocks. He has acute-on-chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.6 and currently 2.6, possibly from diuresis and lisinopril and poor forward flow from VT. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors are being held, and renal dose medications are being avoided along with nephrotoxins.

The patient also has chest wall pain from previous CPR and shocks. Once extubated, the aim is to keep the patient comfortable. Anxiety is present due to repeated shocks, and medications such as seroquel, cital"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and ablation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% following biventricular pacemaker implantation, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He presents with recent discharge and multiple episodes of VT.

In the first 24 hours, the patient did not experience any further episodes of VT, and the ICD was turned off. The patient's medications were discontinued except for fentanyl and midazolam. The plan was to readdress the goals of care if the patient did not have any more VT within 48 hours. However, in the last 12 hours, the patient has had multiple episodes of self-resolving VT.

The current plan is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding further goals of care in the setting of multiple episodes of VT. Metoprolol will be continued for now, along with fentanyl and midazolam for sedation and comfort. The patient remains intubated for comfort due to recurrent ICD shocks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient's recurrent episodes of VT indicate a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 20% suggests compromised cardiac function. Any further deterioration in cardiac function can lead to acute decompensated heart failure, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.
3. Infection: Prolonged intubation and immobility increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
5. Medication Interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, including anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, and sedatives. Potential drug interactions may occur, leading to adverse effects or decreased efficacy of medications.
6. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency requires careful monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications to avoid further renal deterioration.
7. Psychological Factors: The patient's recent discharge and multiple ICD shocks may contribute to psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, or delirium, which can affect the overall recovery process."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia (VT) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and ablation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with biventricular pacemaker, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented with multiple episodes of VT after recent discharge. The patient's current condition includes being intubated for comfort, sedated with fentanyl and midazolam, and receiving heparin prophylaxis. He has had several self-resolving episodes of VT. The plan is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding further goals of care in the setting of recurrent VT. The patient will continue on metoprolol, fentanyl, and midazolam for now. The patient's code status is DNR/do not reintubate, and he is currently in the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent episodes of VT: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of VT, which can be life-threatening and require prompt management to prevent hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection that can lead to worsening respiratory status and systemic infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient in the ICU is experiencing multiple health issues. The patient attempted weaning from sedation and subsequently went into ventricular tachycardia (VT), which was resolved with increased sedation. The patient also had a second episode of VT around midnight, which was resolved with sedation. The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (180 bpm) and blood pressure (143/69 mmHg). The patient is on several medications, including fentanyl, pantoprazole, and metoprolol. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 832 mL and output of 1580 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a set tidal volume of 530 mL and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's blood gases are pending, but their oxygen saturation remains at 97%. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and their neurologic examination is incomplete. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (221 K/uL), hemoglobin (7.3 g/dL), potassium (2.6 mg/dL), and troponin-T (2404 U/L). The patient has chronic renal failure and has received blood products totaling 1580 mL. The patient's condition is currently stable but remains at risk for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and ablation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% post biventricular pacemaker (BiV pacer), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He presents after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.

24-hour events:
- The patient experienced two episodes of VT, which were resolved with increased sedation.
- He wanted to take metoprolol orally but could not due to a clogged oral gastric tube (OGT), so it was ordered intravenously instead.
- The patient had a second episode of VT around midnight, which was resolved with sedation.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's goals of care have been discussed in detail with the patient and his wife, and it was decided yesterday to turn off the ICD and stop all medications except for fentanyl and midazolam for comfort. The patient has not had any recurrent episodes of VT since the ICD function was turned off. He remains intubated for comfort in the setting of recurrent ICD shocks.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old male with CAD, aortic stenosis, VT/VF arrest s/p ICD and
   ablation, CHF (EF 20%) s/p BiV pacer, Afib on coumadin, CRI who
   presents after recent discharge with multiple episodes of VT.
   Goals of care: Patient had frequent episodes of vtach and multiple ICD
   shocks at time of admission. Goals of care have been addressed in
   detail between patient, wife, and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. It was decided to turn off
   the ICD and stop all meds other than fetnanyl/midazolam for comfort.
   VT: ICD off and pt off all meds. Patient has had several self resolving
   episodes of VT.
   - patient has not had arrythmias since ICD function turned off
   Intubation: Was intubated for comfort in setting of recurrent ICD
   shocks.
   - Continue vent with midazolam/fentanyl for comfort.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and ablation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% following biventricular pacing, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presents with recent discharge and multiple episodes of VT. The patient's goals of care have been discussed in detail with the patient and his wife, and it was decided to turn off the ICD and stop all medications except for fentanyl/midazolam for comfort. The patient has had several self-resolving episodes of VT since the ICD function was turned off. He was intubated for comfort due to recurrent ICD shocks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of VT, which can potentially lead to hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.
2. Ventricular Fibrillation: The patient's VF arrest indicates a risk of recurrent VF, which can result in sudden cardiac death.
3. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's CHF with an EF of 20% suggests a compromised cardiac function, increasing the risk of fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and worsening respiratory status.
4. Aortic Stenosis"
