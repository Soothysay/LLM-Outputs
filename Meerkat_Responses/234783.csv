   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch
   is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There
   is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or right
   ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. Compared with the findings of
   the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-10-22**], a
   small-to-moderate pericardial effusion is now present.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is intubated. The patient has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. His current condition includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possible pulmonary edema due to heart failure, and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medication. There is also a concern for possible Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) based on elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Other pending tests include blood cultures, urine cultures, and various viral and fungal markers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of bilateral airspace opacities on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypoxemia and may require mechanical ventilation support.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms and elevated BNP level raise the possibility of pulmonary edema due to heart failure. This condition can cause difficulty breathing and may worsen the patient's respiratory distress.

3. Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP): Elevated LDH levels and the patient's immunocompromised"

   s/p cord blood transplant, with h/o aspergillosis, bacillary
   angiomatosis & cardiomyopathy who presents with acute respiratory
   failure.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: Differential for ARDS includes
   viral/bacterial/fungal infection in chronically immunocomprimised pt
   vs. pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure.  Pt was intubated
   in field & being ventilated per ARDS parameters (e.g., TV @ 5-7 cc/kg
   and high RR).  Pt still requiring PEEP of 15 & FiO2 of 70%, unable to
   wean overnight.   CXR continues to show bilateral infiltrates. RSV
   negative, otherwise, all culture data is pending.  ECHO showed low
   normal LVEF at 50%, mildly elev LA & small to mod effusion, no sign of
   tamponade.  BNP elev at 6800, unclear baseline ?[**2176**], however, it
   appears unlikely that resp failure [**2-14**] pulm edema alone. Will attempt

   transplant, with no e/o active leukemia on D+100 bone marrow biopsy.
   Cyclosporine level was 165 on [**3-18**].  Am level still pending, hold am
   dose for now & adjust regimen prn.
   - continue with careful monitoring of cyclosporine level in the setting
   of ARF (if creatinine >3, give 25 mg IV p.m. dose)
   - continue Cellcept home regimen
   - continue PPx with acyclovir, voriconazole, treatment dose Bactrim +
   Prednisone for possible PCP
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE : presented with creatinine of 1.8, elev from
   baseline 1.2-1.4, consistent with acute on chronic renal failure.
   Etiology unclear, possibly ATN in the setting of hypoperfusion vs drug
   toxicity (possible agents include acyclovir, cyclosporine, vanc,
   voriconazole) Urine eos were negative & urine lytes [**3-18**] showed high
   sodium avidity. Pt did having marginally adequate UOP despite fluid
   resuscitation. Creatinine increased this am at 2.1, continue fluid
   resuscitation for now.

   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch
   is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There
   is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or right
   ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. Compared with the findings of
   the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-10-22**], a

   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch
   is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There
   is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or right
   ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. Compared with the findings of
   the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-10-22**], a
   small-to-moderate pericardial effusion is now present.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who failed multiple chemotherapy regimens and underwent a cord blood transplant. He also has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. The patient presents with acute respiratory failure and is intubated in the field. He is currently being ventilated according to ARDS parameters.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a FiO2 of 70%. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a normal S1 and S2, no murmurs or gallops, supple neck, and unable to appreciate jugular venous pressure (JVP). The respiratory examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds, no wheezes or crackles, and symmetric chest expansion. The abdominal examination shows a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The neurologic examination shows the patient is sedated and not responding to commands.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 50 K/uL, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) 120 days ago. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including coverage for influenza and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), as well as steroids.

The patient's condition is stable with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 99%, and blood pressure within normal limits. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory system compliance of 36.7 cmH2O/mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 15 cmH2O. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 173, and a base excess of -6.

The patient's cardiac status is monitored with an echocardiogram showing mild right atrial pressure elevation, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%, and moderate pericardial effusion. Chest X-ray reveals diffuse bilateral air space disease (ASD) and bilateral effusions. There is also an indwelling catheter in the superior vena cava (S"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) 120 days ago. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The differential diagnosis includes infection/ARDS, aspiration, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume strategy and is tolerating the ventilator settings. There is a concern for a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung on chest X-ray, which may require further investigation with a computed tomography (CT) scan. The patient's renal function has worsened slightly from admission levels, and there is a possibility of drug toxicity due to recent medication changes. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and elevated INR. His sodium levels are low, likely due to resuscitation-related factors, and he requires close monitoring and management. The patient's immune status is compromised due to AML and BMT, and he is on immunosuppressive medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has ARDS, which can be associated with infectious etiology. Broad coverage for bacterial, viral, and atypical pathogens should be continued until specific pathogens are identified.
2. Aspiration: The patient has a cough and acute onset of respiratory failure, raising concern for aspiration as a possible cause.
3. Pulmonary Edema:"

   Imaging: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**3-18**], there is
   substantial
   clearing of the widespread bilateral airspace consolidations.  This is
   most
   consistent with improvement in pulmonary edema, which is substantially
   less
   than on the previous study.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
   persists.
   The hemidiaphragms are again not seen, consistent with some pleural
   fluid and
   basilar atelectasis.  Tubes remain in place.
   IMPRESSION:  Improving pulmonary opacifications, most likely
   representing
   decreasing pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of leukemia, acute renal failure, Aspergillus infection, ARDS, community-acquired pneumonia, and bone marrow transplantation. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been intubated. The patient's condition is improving, with clearing of bilateral airspace consolidations on imaging. However, there is still enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and presence of pleural fluid and basilar atelectasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, he is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat this condition.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and prompt investigation of fever or other signs of infection are essential.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobilization and the hypercoagulable state associated with critical illness increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and low molecular weight heparin should be implemented to reduce the risk.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's pre-existing acute renal failure may worsen due to factors such as nephrotoxic drugs, hypoperfusion,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia who underwent a cord blood transplant. He presented with acute respiratory failure and was intubated in the field. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with PEEP of 15 and FiO2 of 60%. His oxygenation is still an issue, and more aggressive ARDS therapy may be warranted. The patient's acidosis is metabolic in nature, and there is no significant room for respiratory compensation. Emergent dialysis is required if the pH is below 7.2. The chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema, which is improving. The patient had a bronchoscopic examination yesterday with no remarkable findings. Microbiology results are pending.

The patient's medical history includes aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, levofloxacin, and voriconazole. Influenza DFA is negative, and empirical tamiflu is being discontinued. Empirical treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is being given until ruled out. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine cultures have been obtained.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia, who underwent bone marrow transplantation 120 days ago. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has multiple comorbidities including bacterial pneumonia, non-invasive aspergillus infection, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. The patient is mechanically ventilated and requires careful monitoring and management of his respiratory status. Renal function is also a concern, with elevated creatinine levels possibly due to cyclosporine toxicity. Other issues include hyponatremia, elevated INR, and potential ileus. The patient's overall condition remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to worsening respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting a concern for ongoing infection and sepsis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function, which can further worsen if not addressed.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hyponatremia: Low sodium levels can cause electrolyte imbalances and neurological symptoms.
6. Coagulopathy: Elevated INR"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) 120 days ago. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure, specifically acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's main issues include respiratory failure due to ARDS, which is likely related to an infectious process. Broad-spectrum coverage for potential infections, including Aspergillus infection, is being provided. The patient's renal function is also compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels, possibly due to cyclosporine toxicity. Thrombocytopenia and elevated INR are present, requiring close monitoring of coagulation status. Hyponatremia may be related to resuscitation fluids, and the patient has been placed on free water restriction. Given the patient's history of AML and BMT, he is immunosuppressed, and his current regimen includes acyclovir, voriconazole, and antibacterial coverage. The patient's ileus has led to the decision to hold feeds for now. In terms of ICU care, the patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, and receives prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is set to full code, and his disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of leukemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bacterial pneumonia, and bone marrow transplantation. He is currently in the ICU for acute renal failure and non-invasive aspergillus infection. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, acyclovir, voriconazole, Bactrim, and meropenem. He is also receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation, respectively. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 110/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a total intake of 5,403 mL and output of 2,815 mL since midnight. His urine output has been good, with 1,965 mL collected overnight. The patient's laboratory results show elevated potassium and phosphorus levels, as well as slightly low hemoglobin and platelet counts. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and spontaneous breathing efforts.

   Assessment and Plan:
   52 yo male with h/o AML failed multiple chemo regimens, now day #121
   s/p cord blood transplant, with h/o aspergillosis, bacillary
   angiomatosis & cardiomyopathy who presents with acute respiratory
   failure.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: Differential for ARDS includes
   viral/bacterial/fungal infection in chronically immunocomprimised pt
   vs. pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure.  Pt was intubated
   in field & being ventilated per ARDS parameters (e.g., TV @ 5-7 cc/kg
   and high RR).  Pt still requiring PEEP of 15 & FiO2 of 60%.  PO2 in
   80s, and oxygenation becomes an issue, more aggressive ARDS therapy may
   be warranted.   Not significant room to move w/ respiratory
   compensation.  Metabolic acidosis, may require emergent dialsysis if pH
   < 7.2.   CXR continues to show bilateral infiltrates. ECHO showed low
   normal LVEF at 50%, mildly elev LA & small to mod effusion, no sign of
   tamponade.  BNP elev at 6800, unclear baseline ?[**2176**], however, it
   appears unlikely that resp failure [**2-14**] pulm edema alone. Patient had
   bronch yesterday, w/ no remarkable findings, microbiology pending.
   Goal to [**Month (only) 38**] PEEP/FIO2
   - continue Broad spectrum Abx coverage with
   vanc,meropenem,levofloxacin, voriconazole
   -  Influenza DFA negative, d/c
d empiric tamiflu for now
   - empiric Bactrim + Prednsione treatment dose for PCP until rules out
   for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LDH [**Name9 (PRE) **] at 244, trended down to 156 this am, good neg predictive
   value for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u blood cultures, UA & urine cultures
   - CMV negative, f/u bartonella cultures & fungal markers
   - f/u ID & BMT recs
 H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE s/p cord blood transplantation: AML D+121 s/p
   transplant, with no e/o active leukemia on D+100 bone marrow biopsy.
   Cyclosporine level was 165 on [**3-18**].  Yesterday
s cyclosporine was toxix
   in 300s, PM dose was held, and dose decreased to 25mg IV q12.  Because
   of concern of illeus, cellcept changed to IV.
   - f/u morning cyclosporine level, and touch base w/ BMT to see how PM
   dose should be affected.
   - continue Cellcept home regimen
   - continue PPx with acyclovir, voriconazole, treatment dose Bactrim +
   Prednisone for possible PCP
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE : presented with creatinine of 1.8, elev from
   baseline 1.2-1.4, consistent with acute on chronic renal failure.
   Etiology unclear, possibly ATN in the setting of hypoperfusion vs drug
   toxicity (possible agents include acyclovir, cyclosporine, vanc,
   voriconazole) Urine eos were negative x 2 & urine lytes [**3-18**] showed high
   sodium avidity. Pt continues to have have marginally adequate UOP, but
   is not keeping up w/ significant fluid intake.  Non gap acidosis.
   Creatinine currently 2.6.  Etiology on whole believed to be [**2-14**] to
   cyclosporine toxicity.
   - will f/u [**Hospital1 **] lytes & renally dose all meds,  monitoring strict i/os

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia who underwent a cord blood transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is intubated on ARDS parameters. The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which indicate possible pulmonary edema or infection. He also has a low ejection fraction and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels, suggesting heart failure. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal treatment, and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. Aggressive ARDS therapy may be necessary.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low ejection fraction and elevated BNP levels suggest heart failure. Close monitoring of cardiac function and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels are elevated. Renal replacement therapy may be required.
4. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected infection. Cultures and microbiology results are pending.
5. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has high residuals with each feeding and hypoactive bowel sounds, indicating possible ileus. An abdominal CT scan may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently intubated and being ventilated according to ARDS parameters. The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia or pulmonary edema. He also has metabolic acidosis and renal failure, which could be due to various causes such as infection, drug toxicity, or hypoperfusion. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment. He is also on immunosuppressive therapy, including cyclosporine and Cellcept. The patient's platelet count is stable, but he has thrombocytopenia. He has a history of aspergillosis and is currently receiving voriconazole. He is also experiencing ileus with high residuals in tube feeds. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and potentially death if not managed appropriately.

2. Pneumonia: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of bilateral infiltrates, there is a possibility of pneumonia. Early identification and treatment are crucial to prevent further complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone a cord blood transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently intubated and ventilated according to ARDS parameters. The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are consistent with ARDS. His oxygenation is improving, but he still requires supplemental oxygen. The patient also has renal failure with elevated creatinine and potassium levels. His urine output is low, and he is not keeping up with fluid intake. There is a concern for cyclosporine toxicity. The patient's blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine cultures are negative. He has a history of aspergillosis, and his current medications include voriconazole, acyclovir, and treatment dose Bactrim with prednisone for possible Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his ARDS, renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications."

ARDS complicated by overall volume overload: Differential for ARDS
   includes viral/bacterial/fungal infection in chronically
   immunocomprimised pt vs. pulmonary edema in the setting of heart
   failure.  Pt was intubated in field & being ventilated per ARDS
   parameters (e.g., TV @ 5-7 cc/kg and high RR).  Pt still requiring PEEP
   of 15 & FiO2 of 60%.  PO2 109 today. Metabolic acidosis, may require
   emergent dialsysis if pH < 7.2. On HCO3 drip now.  CXR continues to
   show bilateral infiltrates and effusions. ECHO showed low normal LVEF
   at 50%, mildly elev LA & small to mod effusion, no sign of tamponade.
   BNP elev at 6800, unclear baseline ?[**2176**], however, it appears unlikely

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE : presented with creatinine of 1.8, elev from
   baseline 1.2-1.4, now at 2.6. Acute on chronic renal failure.  Etiology
   unclear, possibly ATN in the setting of hypoperfusion vs drug toxicity
   (possible agents include acyclovir, cyclosporine) Urine eos were
   negative x 2 & urine lytes [**3-18**] showed high sodium avidity. Pt continues
   to have have marginally adequate UOP, but is not keeping up w/
   significant fluid intake.  Non gap acidosis. Etiology on whole believed
   to be [**2-14**] to cyclosporine toxicity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has failed multiple chemotherapy regimens. He underwent a cord blood transplant and has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. The patient presents with acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 15 cmH2O and FiO2 of 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, PaO2 of 109 mmHg, and HCO3- of 20 mEq/L. The chest X-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates and effusions. An echocardiogram shows a low-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%, mildly elevated left atrium, and small to moderate effusion without signs of tamponade. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated at 6800. 

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, meropenem, levofloxacin, and voriconazole. Influenza DFA is negative, and empirical tamiflu will be discontinued. Empirical Bactrim will also be stopped due to low suspicion for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone multiple chemotherapy regimens and a cord blood transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. He is intubated and being ventilated according to ARDS parameters. Metabolic acidosis has improved, but the patient may require emergent dialysis if pH < 7.2. An echocardiogram shows low normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 50%, mildly elevated left atrium, and small to moderate effusion without signs of tamponade. It is unlikely that respiratory failure is due to pulmonary edema alone. The patient has bronchospasm with no remarkable findings, and microbiology results are pending. The goal is to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP down to 11.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis persists despite receiving 3 amps of bicarb. If pH < 7.2, emergent dialysis may be required.
2. Renal Failure: The etiology of the patient's acute renal failure is unclear, possibly due to hypoperfusion or drug toxicity (agents include acyclovir, cyclosporine, vanc,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent cord blood transplantation. He presents with acute respiratory failure and ARDS, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient also has metabolic acidosis, volume overload, renal failure, and hyperkalemia. He has a history of aspergillosis and is on voriconazole treatment. The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable, and he has resolved ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition of ARDS poses a significant risk, requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's persistent metabolic acidosis needs to be addressed, and further investigations should be done to determine the underlying cause.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires ongoing renal support, electrolyte management, and medication adjustments based on renal function.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels need careful monitoring and treatment to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Aspergillosis: Although the patient is on voriconazole treatment, there is still a risk of complications related to aspergillosis, such as worsening infection or dissemination.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's stable thrombocytopenia needs ongoing monitoring, and any signs of bleeding or increased risk"

   52 yo male with h/o AML failed multiple chemo regimens, now day 123 s/p
   cord blood transplant, with h/o aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis &
   cardiomyopathy who presents with acute respiratory failure.
   1. Resp failure with ARDS: PO2 86 today. Metabolic acidosis improving.
   CXR continues to show bilateral infiltrates and effusions. Patient had
   bronch, w/ no remarkable findings, microbiology pending.  Goal to
   decrease PEEP
   -  continue Broad spectrum Abx coverage with
   vanc,meropenem,levofloxacin, voriconazole, acyclovir
   -  Influenza DFA negative, d/c
d empiric tamiflu for now.
   -  empiric Bactrim will be continued as PO
 low suspicion for PCP with
   low LDH. F/u on dfa on BAL. Taper down solumedrol.
   -  LDH elev at 244, trended down to 156 this am, good neg predictive
   value for PCP

   - CMV negative, f/u bartonella cultures & fungal markers
   -  f/u ID & BMT recs
   2. AML: s/p cord blood transplantation: AML D+121 s/p transplant, with
   no e/o active leukemia on D+100 bone marrow biopsy. Cyclosporine level
   was 165 on [**3-18**].  Yesterday
s cyclosporine was toxix in 300s, PM dose
   was held, and dose decreased to 25mg IV q12.  Because of concern of
   illeus, cellcept changed to IV.
   - f/u cyclosporine trough.
   - continue Cellcept home regimen
   - continue PPx with acyclovir, voriconazole, atovaquone
    3. ARF: presented with creatinine of 1.8, elev from baseline 1.2-1.4,
   now at 3.0. Acute on chronic renal failure.  Etiology unclear, possibly
   ATN in the setting of hypoperfusion vs drug toxicity (possible agents
   include acyclovir, cyclosporine) Urine eos were negative x 2 & urine
   lytes [**3-18**] showed high sodium avidity. Good UOP on lasix drip. Non gap
   acidosis. Etiology on whole believed to be [**2-14**] to cyclosporine
   toxicity.
   - will f/u [**Hospital1 **] lytes & renally dose all meds,  monitoring strict i/os
   - continues to have worsening renal function, c/s renal.
   - rising Phos  5.4 and decreasing Ca, cannot take phos binder in

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who has failed multiple chemotherapy regimens. He underwent a cord blood transplant on day 123 and has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. The patient presents with acute respiratory failure and is now on day 123 post-transplant.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient has respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and metabolic acidosis. Bilateral infiltrates and effusions are seen on the chest X-ray. The goal is to decrease positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage will be continued, along with other medications.
2. The patient will be followed up for influenza DFA, bacterial cultures, and fungal markers.
3. The patient has acute myeloid leukemia post-cord blood transplantation. Cyclosporine levels need to be monitored, and the dose may need to be adjusted due to toxicity. Cellcept will be administered IV instead of orally due to concern for ileus.
4. The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. Etiology is unclear, possibly due to hypoperfusion or drug toxicity. Urine eos were negative, and urine lytes showed high sodium avidity. Lasix drip will be continued, and all medications will be renally dosed. Strict input/output monitoring will be performed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who failed multiple chemotherapy regimens. He underwent a cord blood transplant on day 123 and has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. The patient presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDS. He has metabolic acidosis, bilateral infiltrates, and effusions on chest X-ray. The patient is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), and a history of sinus aspergillosis. The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening or improvement. Decreasing PEEP and weaning off the ventilator as tolerated will be the goal.
2. Infection (ID): Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be continued to address possible infections. The patient's microbiology results should be closely monitored to guide further treatment decisions.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and the cause of acute renal failure should be investigated. Drug toxicity and hypoperfusion are possible contributing factors. Renal consult has been requested.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia who underwent a cord blood transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues including renal failure, aspergillus infection, thrombocytopenia, ileus, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient presents with acute respiratory failure, which has progressed to ARDS. This condition can be life-threatening and requires prompt management with mechanical ventilation and careful fluid balance.

2. Renal Failure: The patient exhibits signs of renal failure, characterized by elevated creatinine levels, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. This condition requires close monitoring and adjustment of medications, fluid intake/output, and electrolyte management.

3. Aspergillus Infection: The patient has a history of aspergillosis and is currently receiving voriconazole for treatment. Regular monitoring of fungal cultures and glucan levels will help assess the effectiveness of the antifungal therapy.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is experiencing thrombocytopenia, which is likely due to bone marrow suppression post-transplantation. Close monitoring of platelet counts and appropriate management, such as platelet transfusions, will be necessary.

5. Ileus: The patient had an episode of ileus, which is now resolving"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone a cord blood transplant. The patient presents with acute respiratory failure and is diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient has several medical complications, including renal failure, thrombocytopenia, ileus, and a history of aspergillus infection. The etiology of renal failure is unclear, but it could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypoperfusion or drug toxicity. The patient's renal function is currently improving with good urine output on Lasix gtt + chlorthiazide.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable at baseline, and his ileus is resolving. He is now able to tolerate oral medications and has had a bowel movement.

The patient has a history of aspergillus infection, for which he continues to take voriconazole. Other ongoing management includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, weaning off steroids, and monitoring of cyclosporine levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, further deterioration of renal function, development of new infections, and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. The patient's condition will need close monitoring, and appropriate interventions should be made as necessary."

   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**].
   4. ARF: presented with creatinine 1.8, elev from baseline 1.2-1.4, now
   trending down. Acute on chronic renal failure.  Etiology unclear,
   possibly ATN in the setting of hypoperfusion vs drug toxicity (possible
   agents include acyclovir, cyclosporine). Urine eos were negative x 2 &
   urine lytes [**3-18**] showed high sodium avidity. Good UOP on lasix drip +
   prn thiazide. Metabolic acidosis improving slowly. Renal consult
   requested.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone a cord blood transplant. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and is experiencing multi-organ dysfunction.

1. Respiratory Failure with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's CXR shows bilateral infiltrates and effusions, indicating possible ARDS. The patient is hypoxemic and not yet ready to wean from mechanical ventilation. Recruitment trial with increased PEEP will be performed.

2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, levofloxacin, voriconazole, and acyclovir. Empiric treatment for influenza, tamiflu, has been discontinued as DFA negative. Bactrim will be continued as oral therapy due to low suspicion for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with low LDH levels. Taper down of solumedrol will be done.

3. AML status post cord blood transplantation: The patient's bone marrow biopsy on day 100 showed no evidence of active leukemia. Cyclosporine levels were elevated, leading to a decrease in dosage. The patient is on cellcept and atovaquone for prophylaxis against PCP.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient presented with a creatinine level of 1."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent cord blood transplantation. He is currently on day 125 post-transplant and presents with acute respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient has been intubated and is being ventilated according to ARDS parameters. There is still a significant component of volume overload. The patient's echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%, making it unlikely that respiratory failure is due to pulmonary edema alone, but it is likely a secondary process from aggressive fluid resuscitation and acute renal failure.

The patient had bronchoscopy on [**3-19**] with no remarkable findings, and all microbiology tests are negative. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem, and voriconazole), completed 5 days of levofloxacin, and was on Bactrim but discontinued yesterday. Influenza DFA negative, and d/c'd tamiflu. The patient is also on atovaquone for Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis. Methylprednisolone weaning to 20mg q24hrs yesterday, will decrease to 10mg daily today. Repeat PCP aspirate and viral swabs (RSV, Para, Adeno) are pending. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine cultures are also pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with h/o AML failed multiple chemo regimens, now day 125 s/p
   cord blood transplant, with h/o aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis &
   cardiomyopathy who presents with acute respiratory failure.
   1. Resp failure with ARDS:  CXR continues to show bilateral infiltrates
   and effusions but somewhat improved, with better pO2. Will decrease
   PEEP to 10. Patient had bronch, w/ no remarkable findings, microbiology
   pending. Continues to be hypoxemic. Will do recruitment trial with
   increased PEEP. Will continue to diures.
    2. ID: continue broad spectrum Abx coverage with vanc,meropenem,
   voriconazole. Non-neutropenic.
   -  Influenza DFA negative, d/c
d empiric tamiflu for now.  Low
   suspicion for PCP with low LDH. On atovaq proph. Off solumedrol now.
   Acyclovir proph was d/c
   3. AML: s/p cord blood transplantation: with no e/o active leukemia on
   D+100 bone marrow biopsy. Cyclosporine level was 165 on [**3-18**].
   Cyclosporine levels elevated in 300s, dose decreased. On cellcept..
   4. ARF: presented with creatinine 1.8, elev from baseline 1.2-1.4, now
   trending down. Acute on chronic renal failure.  Etiology unclear,
   urine sediment bland. Cyclosporin in setting of calcineuron inhibitor
   with baseline renal insufficiency may have contributed. Urine eos were
   negative x 2 & urine lytes [**3-18**] showed high sodium avidity. Good UOP on
   lasix drip + prn thiazide. Metabolic acidosis improving slowly. Renal
   consult appreciated.
   5. Hx of aspergillus infection / sinus aspergillosis - on voriconazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who failed multiple chemotherapy regimens and underwent a cord blood transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 120/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and voriconazole. Other medications include furosemide, fentanyl, midazolam, lansoprazole, and atovaquone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's presentation of acute respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. ARDS is a serious complication characterized by inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired oxygenation.
2. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplantation and is currently on day 127 post-transplant. The patient presents with acute respiratory failure/ARDS. The differential diagnosis for ARDS includes viral/bacterial/fungal infection in chronically immunocompromised patients, likely causing pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 50%, making it unlikely that respiratory failure is due to pulmonary edema alone. However, a secondary process might be present, possibly secondary to aggressive fluid resuscitation and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient has been diuresing well on Lasix gtt and was weaned down to PEEP of 10 with good oxygenation. The plan is to continue weaning PEEP today and consider a pressure support trial. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is being continued with vancomycin, meropenem, and voriconazole for 5 more days. Influenza DFA is negative, and tamiflu has been discontinued. PCP is also negative, and atovaquone will be continued for prophylactic purposes. Steroid wean has been completed, and blood cultures and urine cultures will be followed up. Viral swabs for RSV, Para, and Adeno will be monitored, as well as CMV viral load, which will be checked"

   presents with acute respiratory failure/ARDS.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: Diff Dx for ARDS includes
   viral/bacterial/fungal infection in chronically immunocomprimised pt
   likely c/b pulm edema [**2-14**] heart failure.  ECHO on adm showed LVEF at
   50%, it is unlikely that resp failure [**2-14**] pulm edema alone, but likely
   a secondary process c/b aggressive fluid resuscitation and ARF. Pt has
   been diuresing well on Lasix gtt.  s/p bronch on [**3-19**] with no remarkable
   findings, microbiology all negative to date.  Pt weaned down to PEEP of
   12 & oxygenating well.  Will continue to wean PEEP & FiO2 today.
   - continue broad spectrum Abx coverage Day 7 of  vanc,meropenem,
   voriconazole. (compl 5 days of Levo)

   with pm dosing.  F/u am level & adjust pm dose according
   - continue with daily cyclosporine level monitoring, dose per level
   with BMT recs
   - continue Cellcept, PPx with acyclovir, voriconazole
   - continue Atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1512**].
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE : Etiology unclear, possibly ATN in the setting
   of hypoperfusion vs drug toxicity.  Pt with resolving metabolic
   acidosis & intermittent hyperkalemia.  Pt having good UOP on Lasix gtt
   and creatinine came down overnight.
   - urine lytes c/w pre-renal etiology, renal suggests cyclosporine
   toxicity as etiology for ARF
   - f/u [**Hospital1 **] lytes & renally dose all meds.  Hyperkalemia improved w/
   improved renal fxn and lasix gtt.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure/ARDS. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for seven days, indicating a concern for bacterial infection. Additionally, the patient has a history of aspergillosus and is on voriconazole, suggesting a possible fungal infection. There are also ongoing tests for viral infections such as influenza, RSV, para influenza, adenovirus, and CMV.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an unclear etiology. It could be due to hypoperfusion or drug toxicity, particularly from cyclosporine. Close monitoring of renal function and medication dosages will be necessary.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia at baseline, which may require careful monitoring for bleeding complications.

4. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient had an ileus that has since resolved, and there is ongoing tolerance of tube feedings. Stool studies are pending to rule out Clostridium difficile infection.

5. Respiratory issues: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support with a low tidal volume strategy. Weaning of PEEP and FiO2 is planned.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 152/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, set respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has a history of allergies to Benadryl and is receiving multiple medications including Ambisome (Amphotericin B Liposome), Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl), and various antibiotics such as Acyclovir, Voriconazole, Vancomycin, Atovaquone, and Meropenem.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), but decreased creatinine (Cr) and blood glucose levels. Other lab values including electrolytes, liver function tests (ALT/AST), kidney function tests (BUN/creatinine), and cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) are within normal limits or show no significant changes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient has respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as evidenced by bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The plan is to decrease PEEP to 8 and wean to pressure support ventilation (PSV) if tolerated.
2. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage including Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Voriconazole due to his immunocompromised state and history of aspergillosis.
3. The patient had a cord blood transplant for AML and is showing improvement with no evidence of active leukemia on day 100 bone marrow biopsy.
4. The patient is experiencing acute on chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels. The etiology is unclear, and a renal consult has been appreciated.
5. The patient has a history of aspergillus infection and sinus aspergillosis and is currently on Voriconazole home regimen.
6. The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of approximately 50,000/mm3.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure and ARDS pose a high risk for further deterioration in lung function, requiring careful management and monitoring.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of healthcare-associated infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or bloodstream infections.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if the underlying cause is not identified and treated appropriately.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or trauma.
5. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy may predispose him to cardiac complications, including arrhythmias or heart failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant and has been on multiple chemotherapy regimens. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an infection caused by Aspergillus, bacillary angiomatosis, cardiomyopathy, thrombocytopenia, acute on chronic renal failure, and a history of sinus aspergillosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure with ARDS: The patient's condition is characterized by bilateral infiltrates and effusions on chest X-ray. The healthcare team plans to decrease PEEP to 8 and wean to pressure support ventilation (PSV) if tolerated. This indicates a potential risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, including vancomycin, meropenem, and voriconazole. This suggests an ongoing infection that needs to be managed. The healthcare team also mentions low suspicion for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and is monitoring the patient's LDH levels. 

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure superimposed on chronic renal failure. The etiology of the acute renal failure is unclear, but it may be related to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent cord blood transplantation. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new fevers, and volume overload.

The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, with an unclear etiology. All infectious workup has been unrevealing to date. The patient is immunocompromised and presented with volume overload and acute renal failure (ARF), making it unlikely that respiratory failure alone caused the ARF.

The patient has been diuresing well and weaned to PEEP of 5 yesterday, although his pO2 remains at 69 despite increasing FiO2 to 50%. The patient was febrile overnight, pancultured, and all cultures are negative.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Recheck ABG later today after increasing PEEP to 10.
2. Repeat blood/urine/sputum cultures.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, meropenem, and voriconazole.
4. Start levofloxacin and Flagyl today.
5. Follow up blood, urine, and Bartonella cultures.
6. Follow up BMT recommendations.
7. Goal I/Os 500 to 1L negative.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the progress note are:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of AML, immunocompromise, and previous aspergillosis. He is currently febrile with negative cultures, suggesting a possible ongoing infection. Possible sources include Hickman line site infection, sinus infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or Clostridium difficile infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which may progress or not improve despite current management.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to either hypotension or drug toxicity. Monitoring of electrolytes and adjustment of medication dosages are important for management.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia at baseline, which needs to be monitored closely.

5. Other possible complications may include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), sinusitis, and recurrent aspergillosis.

The patient's overall condition requires close monitoring and management by the ICU team, including regular reassessment of vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies as indicated."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a cord blood transplant. He presented with acute respiratory failure and ARDS, and all infectious workup has been unrevealing so far. The patient is immunocompromised and has been experiencing fevers, volume overload, and acute renal failure. He has been diuresing well and weaned to PEEP of 5, although his pO2 is still low despite increased FiO2. The patient was febrile overnight and pancultured, with all cultures being negative. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, inflammation, or trauma. It is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs, leading to impaired oxygenation.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection acquired while on a ventilator. The patient's fevers and positive Gram stain results may suggest an infectious etiology.

3. Drug Toxicity: The patient's renal failure could be related to drug toxicity, particularly cyclosporine toxicity. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant commonly used in post-transplant patients and can cause nephrotoxicity.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's recent onset of hypernatremia is likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. It is important to monitor fluid balance closely and adjust electrolyte management accordingly.

5. Aspergillosis: The patient has a history of aspergillosis and is currently on voriconazole therapy. Close monitoring for any signs or symptoms of aspergillosis recurrence is necessary.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's stable thrombocytopenia needs to be monitored regularly, as it can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

7. Illeus: The patient's resolved ileus requires continued monitoring of bowel function and stool studies to rule out any complications such as Clostridium difficile infection.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be required to confirm or rule out these complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cord blood transplantation who presents with acute respiratory failure/ARDS. The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions including pneumonia, renal failure, hypernatremia, and thrombocytopenia. He is currently receiving multiple medications and treatments for his conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is tolerating feeds well. However, he continues to have fevers and is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. This is a common complication in critically ill patients and can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to drug toxicity or hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications are necessary to prevent further complications.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has developed hypernatremia, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. This condition can lead to neurological complications if not managed properly.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet counts and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

5. Infection: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with h/o AML failed multiple chemo regimens, now day 128 s/p
   cord blood transplant, with h/o aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis &
   cardiomyopathy who presents with acute respiratory failure.
   1. Resp failure with ARDS:  CXR improved overall but continues to have
   O2/peep requirements. Bronch w/ no remarkable findings, microbiology
   negative. Will continue to keep even to negative.
   2. Fever/ ID: continue broad spectrum Abx coverage with vanc,
   meropenem. On home dose voriconazole. Non-neutropenic. Cultures
   negative, cdiff pending. Would consider adding back atypical coverage.
   Reasonable to start empiric flagyl while cdiff pending. Low suspicion
   for PCP with low LDH. On atovaq proph. Off solumedrol. Acyclovir proph.
   CXR not c/w VAP. Line does not look infected. Agree with head CT to
   check sinuses.  Will add chest CT looking at parenchyma, effusions. F/u
   on all cultures.
   3. AML: s/p cord blood transplantation: with no e/o active leukemia on
   D+100 bone marrow biopsy. Cyclosporine levels elevated on admission,
   dose decreased. On cellcept.
   4. ARF: creatinine much improved with good u/o. Acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Etiology unclear, urine sediment bland. Cyclosporin in

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone a cord blood transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory failure with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's oxygenation requirements remain high despite positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) adjustments. Chest X-ray shows improvement but still shows signs of ARDS. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis is negative for any infectious agents.
2. Fever and Infection: The patient continues to have a fever, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. Cultures are negative, and C. difficile testing is pending. Atypical coverage may be considered, and empirical treatment for C. difficile should be initiated given the high suspicion.
3. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): The patient has undergone cord blood transplantation and is currently on cyclosporine. Cyclosporine levels were elevated on admission, and the dose has been decreased. The patient is also on cellcept.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have improved, and urine output"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent cord blood transplantation for AML. He is currently day #128 post-transplant and presents with acute respiratory failure/ARDS, new fevers, and sinusitis. The patient's respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) etiology remains unclear, with all infectious workup unrevealing to date. The patient is immunocompromised and presented with volume overload and ARF, making it unlikely that respiratory failure is due to pulmonary edema alone.

The patient has been diuresing well but continues to be febrile for more than 48 hours, and all cultures are negative. The patient has a history of aspergillosus infection and is currently on voriconazole home regimen. The patient's renal failure is resolving, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension versus drug toxicity.

The patient has stable thrombocytopenia at baseline. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren Renal 40cc/hr, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and monitoring of lines. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention with boots, stress ulcer prevention with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head-of-bed elevation and mouth care.

The patient's disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent cord blood transplantation for AML and is currently on day 129 post-transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure/ARDS, new fevers, and volume overload. The etiology of ARDS is unclear, and all infectious workup has been unrevealing to date. The patient is immunocompromised and has been receiving various antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is already experiencing ARDS, and the underlying cause is still unclear. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and providing appropriate ventilatory support.

2. Infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient remains febrile. Further investigation and cultures should be obtained to identify the source of infection. The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of opportunistic infections.

3. Sinusitis and Pneumonia: A CT scan suggests evidence of sinusitis and multifocal pneumonia. These conditions should be treated appropriately with targeted antibiotics if necessary.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the LE Doppler is negative for DVT, it is still important to monitor the patient's lower extremities for signs of thrombosis.

5. Renal Failure: The patient had acute renal failure, likely due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent cord blood transplantation. He is currently on day 129 post-transplant and presents with acute respiratory failure/ARDS, new fevers, and volume overload. The etiology of the respiratory distress syndrome is unclear, as all infectious workup results have been negative. The patient has been diuresing well but continues to be febrile for over 48 hours, with cultures showing no growth. A CT scan suggests multifocal pneumonia, but sputum is negative. The patient's Hickman line site is non-tender, and there are no new infiltrates on the chest X-ray. A leg Doppler test is negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and the CT scan shows evidence of sinusitis and multifocal pneumonia. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been negative twice, and all stool cultures are negative. The patient's renal failure is resolving, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension or drug toxicity. The patient's calcium replacement, strict intake/output monitoring, and Lanthanum phosphate binder will be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is experiencing ARDS, which can be a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. The etiology of ARDS in"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone cord blood transplantation. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient has had a complicated post-transplant course, including bacillary angiomatosis, acute appendicitis, and aspergillus sinusitis. He is experiencing fever, and his CT scan shows evidence of sinusitis and multifocal pneumonia. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. He is receiving respiratory support through mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O. His blood cultures were taken at 09:59 AM on 03/26/2184, and he has received various doses of antibiotics since then. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 124/70 mmHg to 141/75 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 3.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 44 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL, and other abnormalities. Imaging studies reveal a left sphenoid air-fluid level on CT sinus and bibasilar infiltrates, scattered areas of ground glass, and moderate bilateral effusions on CT chest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to various causes, including pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or complications from the AML and transplantation.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and evidence of sinusitis and multifocal pneumonia on CT scan, indicating a possible infection. The choice of antibiotics and antifungals should be reassessed based on the culture results and clinical response.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and platelet transfusion may be necessary.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests renal impairment. Renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to manage this complication.
5. Thrombotic events: Although the patient had a negative leg ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), he is still at risk for thrombotic events due to his critical illness and immobilization. Prophylactic measures should be continued.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, possible infections, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and potential thrombotic events. Close monitoring and aggressive management are required to address these complications and improve the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant 130 days ago. He presented with acute respiratory failure and ARDS, and has been experiencing fevers. His current condition includes low cyclosporine levels, desaturation events, low-grade fevers, and mucus plugging. He has been on multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The etiology of ARDS is unclear, and all infectious workup has been unrevealing to date. The patient is immunocompromised and presented with volume overload and ARF, making respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema unlikely. The patient has been diuresing well but continues to be febrile for more than 48 hours, with cultures pending.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has trended down slightly but remains stable at baseline.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient had acute renal failure, likely secondary to either hypotension or drug toxicity. However, the patient's renal function is resolving, and the creatinine level has returned to baseline.
4. History of Aspergillosus Infection: The patient has a history of sinus aspergillosis and is currently on Voriconazole.
5. Sinusitis: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent cord blood transplantation and is currently on day 130 post-transplant. He presented with acute respiratory failure/ARDS, new fevers, and volume overload. The etiology of ARDS is unclear, with all infectious workup being unrevealing to date. The patient has been diuresing well but continues to be febrile for more than 48 hours, with cultures negative to date. Imaging suggests multifocal pneumonia, but sputum is negative. A bronchoscopy was performed, with microbiology pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient presented with ARDS, which can lead to severe lung dysfunction and respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: Despite negative cultures so far, the patient's persistent fever indicates the possibility of an ongoing infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic treatment are necessary.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's initial presentation included volume overload, which needs to be carefully managed to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema.
4. Renal Failure: The patient experienced acute renal failure, likely due to either hypotension or drug toxicity. Close monitoring of renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly are essential.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending down slightly but remains stable at baseline."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent cord blood transplantation 130 days ago. He has had a complicated post-transplant course, including bacillary angiomatosis, acute appendicitis, and aspergillus sinusitis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure of unclear etiology. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. His vital signs are stable, but he has low-grade fever and a trace amount of right pleural effusion. Laboratory results show leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, with normal kidney and liver function. Imaging reveals a bibasilar infiltrate/effusion on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infection: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to a pulmonary infection, as indicated by the presence of a bibasilar infiltrate/effusion on chest X-ray and negative BAL gram stain results. Further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Cyclosporine lung toxicity: The patient's respiratory failure could also be caused by cyclosporine lung toxicity. This possibility is being considered, and the dose of cyclosporine has been decreased per BMT recommendations.
3. Renal failure: The patient had resolving renal failure, but"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone cord blood transplantation. He presents with respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient has experienced a complicated post-transplant course, including bacillary angiomatosis, acute appendicitis, and aspergillus sinusitis. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. His blood gases show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 110 and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41 mmHg. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) within normal limits, respiratory rate (RR) set at 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 4.8 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count (Plt) of 40 K/uL, and normal kidney function with creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 1.3 to 1.4 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. Imaging reveals a bibasilar infiltr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent cord blood transplantation 130 days ago. He presented with acute respiratory failure and ARDS, new fevers, and volume overload. The etiology of ARDS is unclear, and all infectious workup has been unrevealing. The patient has been diuresing well but continues to be febrile for more than 48 hours. A CT scan suggests multifocal pneumonia, and sputum is negative to date. Bronchoscopy was performed yesterday, and the results are pending. The patient's BMT is concerned that cyclosporine may be responsible for ARDS, as there have been case reports in the literature.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition suggests ARDS, which is a serious condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli. This can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient has been febrile for more than 48 hours, and all cultures are negative so far. There is a concern for a possible infection, especially considering the patient's immunocompromised state due to the cord blood transplantation. Multifocal pneumonia is suspected based on the CT scan, and the results of the bronchoscopy are pending.
3. Renal Failure: The patient had acute renal failure, which is likely due"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant 130 days ago.
- He presented with acute respiratory failure and ARDS, and has been experiencing new fevers.
- All infectious workup has been unrevealing to date, and the patient is immunocompromised.
- The patient has been diuresing well but continues to be febrile for more than 48 hours.
- A CT scan suggests multifocal pneumonia, and sputum is negative to date.
- Bronchoscopic evaluation with microbiological sampling is pending.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 254, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on 50% FiO2.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
- Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress.
- Laboratory tests show leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 4.3 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 35 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.4 mg/dL, and elevated lactate acid level of 1.1 mmol/L.
- The patient has a history of leukemia and is currently on immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine.
- He also has a history of sinus aspergillosis and is on voriconazole therapy.
- The patient's renal function is improving, and his urine output (UOP) is good with lasix diuresis.
- The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which has been negative twice, and all stool cultures are negative to date.
- Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with boots, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head-of-bed (HOB) elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up, and respiratory system assessment by bedside nurse (RSBI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been experiencing acute respiratory failure, and ARDS is a potential complication in this case.
2. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and multifocal pneumonia seen on CT scan suggest a possible ongoing infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with h/o AML failed multiple chemo regimens, now day 128 s/p
   cord blood transplant, with h/o aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis &
   cardiomyopathy who presents with acute respiratory failure.
   1. Resp failure with ARDS:  unclear etiology, question of aspiration vs
   infection (all cx neg) vs less likely cyclosporine. CXR improved
   overall but continues to have O2/peep requirements. Bronch w/ no
   remarkable findings, microbiology negative. Will continue to keep even
   to negative and wean peep. SBT today.
   2. Fever/ ID: continue broad spectrum Abx coverage with vanc,
   meropenem, flagyl. On home dose voriconazole. Non-neutropenic. Cultures
   negative. Reasonable to start empiric flagyl while cdiff pending. Low
   suspicion for PCP with low LDH. On atovaq proph. Off solumedrol.
   Acyclovir proph. CXR not c/w VAP. Line does not look infected. Agree
   with head CT to check sinuses.  Will add chest CT looking at
   parenchyma, effusions. F/u on all cultures.
   3. AML: s/p cord blood transplantation: with no e/o active leukemia on
   D+100 bone marrow biopsy. Cyclosporine levels elevated on admission,
   dose decreased. On cellcept.
   4. ARF: creatinine much improved with good u/o. Acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Etiology unclear, urine sediment bland. Cyclosporin in
   setting of calcineuron inhibitor with baseline renal insufficiency may
   have contributed. Urine eos were negative x 2 & urine lytes [**3-18**] showed
   high sodium avidity.  Renal input appreciated.
   5. Hx of aspergillus infection / sinus aspergillosis - on voriconazole
   home regimen.
   6. Thrombocytopenia: at baseline, ~50.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who failed multiple chemotherapy regimens and underwent a cord blood transplant on day 128. He has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. The patient presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a controlled mode ventilation (CMV)/assist mode, set with a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood pressure is 107/59 mmHg, heart rate is 75 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on the ventilator.

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin, due to fever and suspicion of infection. His cultures have been negative so far. He is also on voriconazole for prophylaxis against aspergillosis.

The patient's renal function has improved with good urine output, but he still has acute on chronic renal failure. His platelet count is at baseline, around 50,000. He has a history of sinus aspergillosis and is currently on voriconazole home regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone multiple chemotherapy regimens and a cord blood transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. He is experiencing fever, and his ID team is providing broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. His blood cultures are negative, and he has been started on atovaquone for Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires mechanical ventilation. The etiology of ARDS is unclear, and there is a question of aspiration versus infection. The CXR has shown overall improvement but continues to have oxygenation requirements. Bronchoscopy with no remarkable findings and negative microbiology suggests that the cause may not be infection-related. Cyclosporine toxicity could also be a contributing factor. Weaning off positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be important in determining the next steps for respiratory management.

2. Fever/Infectious Disease: The patient has persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. His ID team should continue to"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone a cord blood transplant. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition is unclear etiology, with questions of aspiration versus infection or less likely cyclosporine. Although the chest X-ray has improved overall, he continues to require supplemental oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Bronchoscopy results were unremarkable, and microbiology tests are negative. The plan is to continue weaning off PEEP and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today.

2. Fever and infection: The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and Flagyl. Additionally, he is on voriconazole for suspected aspergillosis. All cultures are currently negative. It is recommended to continue the current antibiotic regimen and obtain further input from the infectious disease team.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, but his renal function remains compromised. The etiology of acute renal failure is unclear, and the presence of calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may have contributed to the renal insufficiency."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent cord blood transplantation on day 131 post-transplant. He presented with acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite diuresis and respiratory support, the patient remains intermittently febrile, and all cultures are negative to date. Imaging suggests multifocal pneumonia, but bronchoscopic examination did not reveal any significant findings. The patient's renal function has improved, and he is now expected to recover from acute renal failure. The patient's blood culture showed no growth, and tests for Legionella and Pneumocystis jirovecii were negative. The acid-fast smear was also negative. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and the healthcare team is awaiting further results from ongoing investigations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient presented with acute respiratory failure and was diagnosed with ARDS. This condition can lead to severe respiratory distress and may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: Despite the negative bronchoscopic examination, imaging suggests multifocal pneumonia. If left untreated, pneumonia can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of secondary infections.

3. Drug fever: The patient has been febrile intermittently since March 25th. Drug fever should be considered as a possible cause, especially if the Hickman line site is non-tender and there are no signs of infection. Stopping"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a cord blood transplant. He presented with acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is still ongoing. The etiology of ARDS is unclear, and all infectious workup has been unrevealing to date. The patient is immunocompromised and has been experiencing volume overload and acute renal failure (ARF). 

The patient has been diuresing well and has been afebrile for more than 48 hours. He has pancultured, and all cultures are negative to date. A CT scan suggests multifocal pneumonia, but sputum is negative. The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**3-27**], and the results are pending. The BMT is concerned that cyclosporine may be responsible for ARDS, as there have been case reports in the literature. They have stopped the cyclosporine on [**3-29**]. The patient has been unable to wean to a PEEP of 5 overnight and will attempt again today. The goal is to work towards extubation, and the respiratory system's blood gas index (RSBI) is 29. 

The patient has been on antibiotics since day 13 (Vanc/Meropenem) and day 5 Levofloxacin and Flagyl. He is also on his home regimen of Acyclovir and At"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent cord blood transplantation on day 131. He presented with acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and his etiology remains unclear. The patient has been diuresing well and continues to be intermittently febrile. All cultures have been negative to date, and a CT scan suggests multifocal pneumonia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**3-27**], with pending results. The patient's immunocompromised state, volume overload, and acute respiratory failure make it unlikely that pulmonary edema alone is responsible for his respiratory failure.

The patient has been on antibiotics for 13 days, including vancomycin and meropenem, as well as levofloxacin and Flagyl for 5 days. He is also on his home regimen of acyclovir and atovaquone, as well as voriconazole. Cyclosporine has been discontinued due to concerns about its potential role in causing ARDS. The patient has been unable to wean to PEEP of 5 overnight but will attempt again today. The respiratory support mode is currently CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL and spontaneous Vt of 490 mL. The plateau pressure is 18 cmH2O, and the respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 29.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with h/o AML failed multiple chemo regimens, now day 131 s/p
   cord blood transplant, with h/o aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis &
   cardiomyopathy who presents with acute respiratory failure.
   1. Resp failure with ARDS:  appears to be improving. Remains vent
   dependent. Will try to wean aggressively today with possible
   extubation. RSBI 29. SBT today.
   Initial ARDS precipitant is unclear. There is a question of aspiration
   vs infection (all cx neg) vs less likely cyclosporine.
   Bronch w/ no remarkable findings, microbiology negative. Will continue
   to keep even to negative.
   2. Fevers/ ID: continue broad spectrum Abx coverage with vanc,
   meropenem, flagyl, levo. On home dose voriconazole. Non-neutropenic.
   All cultures negative. On atovaq PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. Off solumedrol. Acyclovir
   proph. F/u on all cultures. Will d/c meropenem. Consider non-infectious
   process for fevers.[**3-26**] LENIs negative. BAL x 2 no growth.
   Sphenoid process on sinus CT minimal.  On vori/levo/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/vanco/flagyl.
   ENT has assessed - nasal sample pending.  Appreciate ID's help and
   recommendations.
   3. AML: s/p cord blood transplantation: with no e/o active leukemia on
   D+100 bone marrow biopsy. Cyclosporine levels elevated on admission,
   dose decreased, now likely to be stopped and transitioned to high dose
   steroids. On cellcept.
   4. ARF: creatinine improving with good u/o.
   Acute on chronic renal failure.  Etiology unclear, urine sediment
   bland. Cyclosporin in setting of calcineuron inhibitor with baseline
   renal insufficiency may have contributed.
   5. Hx of aspergillus infection / sinus aspergillosis. Now with sphenoid
   sinus air/fluid level
 on broad spectrum Abx including vori.
   6. Thrombocytopenia: decreased, baseline is  ~ 50

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone multiple chemotherapy regimens and a cord blood transplant. The patient's current condition is critical, and he is admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. 

The patient's medical history includes failed chemotherapy regimens, a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. He presents with acute respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSI) of 29. The initial cause of ARDS is unclear, with possibilities including aspiration, infection, or less likely cyclosporine. Bronchoscopy with no remarkable findings and negative microbiology results have been performed. 

The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, Flagyl, and Levofloxacin. He is also on voriconazole prophylaxis for possible fungal infection. Acyclovir prophylaxis has been started due to concerns about viral infections. Cultures are pending, and the patient's fevers are being monitored. 

The patient's renal function is improving, with decreasing creatinine levels. The etiology of acute on chronic renal failure is unclear, but cyclosporine may have contributed to the renal insufficiency.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history includes acute leukemia, acute renal failure, non-invasive aspergillus infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and a history of bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

The patient was extubated successfully and placed on a fact tent but developed urethral pain and grossly bloody urine. The Foley catheter was changed, and the patient received 6 liters of crystalloid intravenous fluid, with hemoglobin concentration stable over the next three hours. However, the pain worsened in the morning, and no urine output was observed for two hours. A possible clot was identified, and the Foley catheter was discontinued. The patient had more than 300 cc of urine output.

The patient is scheduled to start taking Tacrolimus in the morning as a replacement for cyclosporine. The patient has allergies to Benadryl, Ambisome, and Flomax. The last doses of antibiotics given were Vancomycin on 03/29/2184 at 08:00 PM, Meropenem on 03/30/2184 at 06:00 AM, and Levofloxacin on 03/30/2184 at 02:00 PM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/62 to 151/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 105.2 kg, with a decrease from admission weight of 115 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 575 mL and 65 mL since 12 AM, with total output of 4140 mL and 1245 mL. The patient received 335 mL of IV fluids and had 3900 mL of urine output.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and CPAP mode on the ventilator. Oxygen delivery is set at 50% FiO2, with a peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 154, and ventilation rate of 10.2 L/min.

Physical examination reveals trace bilateral peripheral edema and symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds. Neurological examination is not assessed due to the patient being intubated.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 3.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 39 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 40 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and glucose of 134 mg/dL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent cord blood transplantation. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers, and various cultures have been negative. He has also been diagnosed with renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and is undergoing diuresis. The patient's platelet count is low, but it has slightly increased overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has persistent opacifications at the bases of the lungs, suggesting the possibility of developing pneumonia. This can be confirmed through further imaging and assessment.
2. Drug-induced fever: The patient has been intermittently febrile since [3-25], and it is important to consider the possibility of drug-induced fever, especially since Meropenem was stopped yesterday.
3. Hematuria: The patient developed urethral pain and grossly bloody urine after Foley catheter placement. This could be due to elevated INR secondary to cyclosporine toxicity. The patient's blood clots in the Foley catheter should be monitored, and BK virus should be checked.
4. Sinusitis: The patient has a history of aspergillosis and developed new fevers along with CT findings of left sphenoid sinusitis. This needs to be evaluated"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with h/o AML failed multiple chemo regimens, s/p cord blood
   transplant, with h/o aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis &
   cardiomyopathy who presents with acute respiratory failure.
   1. Resp failure with ARDS:  extubated and doing well. Still has O2
   requirements but without resp distress.
   Initial ARDS precipitant was unclear. There is a question of aspiration
   vs infection (all cx neg) vs less likely cyclosporine.
   Will continue to keep even to negative.
   2. Fevers/ ID: continue broad spectrum Abx coverage with vanc, flagyl,
   levo. On home dose voriconazole. Non-neutropenic. All cultures
   negative. On atovaq PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. Off solumedrol. Acyclovir proph. F/u on
   all cultures. Meropenem d/c'd [**3-30**]. Consider non-infectious process for
   fevers. [**3-26**] LENIs negative. BAL x 2 no growth.
   Sphenoid process on sinus CT minimal.  ENT has assessed - nasal sample
   pending.  Appreciate ID's help and recommendations.
   3. AML: s/p cord blood transplantation: with no e/o active leukemia.
   Cyclosporine levels elevated on admission, dose decreased, now likely
   to be stopped and transitioned to high dose steroids. On cellcept.
   4. ARF: creatinine improving. Acute on chronic renal failure.  Etiology
   unclear, urine sediment bland.
   5. Hx of aspergillus infection / sinus aspergillosis:no with sphenoid
   sinus air/fluid level
 on broad spectrum Abx including vori.
   6. Thrombocytopenia: back to baseline of  ~ 50
   7. Hematuria - d/t trauma. Watch u/o, consider reinserting foley.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a cord blood transplant. He has a history of aspergillosis, bacillary angiomatosis, and cardiomyopathy. The patient presented with acute respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. He was extubated yesterday and is currently on supplemental oxygen. The initial cause of ARDS was unclear, but it may have been due to aspiration, infection, or less likely cyclosporine.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure with ARDS: The patient has experienced respiratory failure and developed ARDS. He was extubated and is still requiring supplemental oxygen but without respiratory distress. The cause of ARDS is still unclear and may have been due to aspiration, infection, or less likely cyclosporine.
2. Fevers/Infectious Disease: The patient has fevers, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated. Cultures have been negative, and he is on voriconazole for suspected aspergillosis. He is also on atovaq for Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis and off solumedrol. Acyclovir prophylaxis is being given, and all cultures are being followed up on. Meropenem was discontinued on 3/30.
3. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): The patient had AML and underwent a cord blood transplantation. There"
