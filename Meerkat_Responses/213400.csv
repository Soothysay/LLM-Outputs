","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a medical history of type 1 diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease status post right popliteal artery bypass, and two-vessel coronary artery disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placed to the right coronary artery. She is currently intubated, on pressors, with a balloon pump in place. The patient presented with STEMI and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to inferior MI and severe coronary artery disease.
2. Vasodilatory shock due to the use of vasodilators in the management of DKA.
3. Hemodynamic instability requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment of fluid and pressor support.
4. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
5. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Hyperglycemia and DKA requiring continuous insulin infusion.
7. Potential complications related to the balloon pump, such as bleeding or cardiac tamponade.
8. Renal dysfunction due to hypotension and use of nephrotoxic medications.
9. Potential arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
10. Infection at the site of arterial sheath placement.
11. Pulmonary edema"

","The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a medical history of type 1 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent successful PCI of the RCA with bare metal stent placement. She is currently on a balloon pump, intubated, and receiving dopamine to maintain MAP>60.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 127/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. Her physical examination reveals a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and S2 sounds and no murmurs, S3, or S4. She has cold feet but warmth up to her ankles, along with trace LE edema and a Charcot foot.

Her laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly low Hct levels, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low magnesium level. Her cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) are elevated, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Her glucose level is significantly elevated at 552 mg/dL, consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, SaO2 of 100%, and HCO3- of 27 mEq/L. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is low at 88%. Her chest X-ray reveals no acute abnormalities.

The patient's current medications include midazolam, heparin, insulin, and dopamine infusions. She is also receiving famotidine, dextrose, and ASA. The plan includes weaning off dopamine, continuing heparin, ASA, and Plavix. The patient's IABP will be continued, and an echocardiogram will be obtained.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of STEMI and ongoing myocardial injury, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock due to impaired cardiac function.

2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's significantly elevated glucose level and presence of ketones would indicate DKA, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.

3. Infection: The patient is intubated and on pressors, making her at higher risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.

5. Hypotension: The patient requires dopamine to maintain blood pressure, indicating potential hypotension.

6. Arrhythmias"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease status post right popliteal bypass, two-vessel coronary disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placed to RCA. She was previously on a balloon pump, which was successfully removed yesterday. She is currently intubated and off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of two-vessel coronary disease and had an inferior STEMI with a bare metal stent placed to RCA. There is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis.
2. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and underwent a right popliteal bypass. There is a risk of graft failure or development of new peripheral vascular complications.
3. Charcot foot: The patient has severe Charcot foot deformities. There is a risk of further foot deformity progression, infection, or ulceration.
4. Diabetes: The patient has type 1 diabetes with complications including neuropathy and retinopathy. There is a risk of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), or other diabetic emergencies.
5. Balloon pump complications: Although the balloon pump was successfully removed, there is a risk of complications such as cardiac tamponade, arrhythmias,"

s examination.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 3446**]
   suffered an inferior wall myocardial infarction from a 100% proximal
   RCA occlusion that was treated with a BMS.  Her course was complicated
   due to respiratory dependence from acute respiratory failure and
   requirements for an IABP due to cardiogenic shock.  She has made a
   steady recovery.  She is currently off pressures and the IABP has been
   removed.  We will wean her from the ventricular today and institute a
   standard post STEMI protocol.

","The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the ICU after an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) and was treated with a bare metal stent placement to the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient experienced respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to cardiogenic shock. She has since recovered and is now off of pressures and the IABP has been removed. The plan is to wean her from the ventilator today and start a standard post STEMI protocol.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring for signs of infection and maintaining proper ventilation techniques can help prevent these complications.
2. Cardiac complications: As the patient had an MI and received a stent placement, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure. Close monitoring of cardiac function and timely intervention if necessary can help prevent these complications.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has type 1 diabetes, and hyperglycemia was initially concerning for DKA. Close monitoring of blood sugar levels and appropriate insulin management is essential to prevent DKA.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary emb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and intubation following an inferior myocardial infarction. The patient had a balloon pump in place, which was successfully removed yesterday. She was on dopamine gtt but was able to wean off of it overnight. The patient's current condition includes euvolemia, EF >55%, normal sinus rhythm, hyperglycemia, and a history of multiple sclerosis and depression.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Respiratory issues: Since the patient is intubated, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Elevating the head of the bed (HOB) can help reduce this risk.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes and is currently experiencing hyperglycemia. Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin gtt are necessary to maintain blood sugar levels within the target range.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at an increased risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures, such as"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive in the cath lab and required intubation and initiation of dopamine gtt. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain MAP>60.

2. Fluid Balance: The patient's total fluid input exceeds the output, resulting in a positive fluid balance. This may require adjustment of fluid administration to prevent fluid overload and subsequent complications"

- The patient has an altered mental status, which is not delirium.
- The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack).
- The patient is diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
- The patient has impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/51 mmHg to 152/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving various medications through infusions and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose levels, and liver enzymes. The results also indicate abnormal electrolyte levels and kidney function.

The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including the placement and removal of catheters, invasive ventilation, administration of antibiotics, and insertion of IV lines. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. Additionally, the presence of impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers or wound infections.

2. Cardiovascular complications: Given the patient's"

Restart dopamine gtt if needed to tolerate MAP>55, bolus 200 ccs for RA pressures <[**11-14**], continue ASA 325mg po daily and now (post plavix load of 600mg) continue plavix 75mg po daily for 1 year, restart metoprolol tartrate 25mg po bid, now that dopamine weaned off and BPs doing well, consider Lisinopril tomorrow if BP tolerates, continue simvastatin 80mg po daily, CKs down-trending, no further CEs.
2. PUMP: PCWP 26 in cath lab. Currently appears euvolemic. Goal MAP 55-60.
3. RHYTHM: Currently NSR. Monitor on telemetry.
4. Hyperglycemia: Type 1 diabetic, followed at [**Last Name (un) **]. Anion Gap of 23 initially, concerning for DKA, closed with fluids. Overnight, sugars on the lower side (80s, 90s) and then in 200s this AM following institution of nutrition around midnight. Continue insulin gtt to maintain sugars in 200s, when without tube feeds as preparation for extubation, cute insulin dose in half, appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs, IV fluids as above, titrate to RA pressures, switch to daily chem 7, K repletion prn.
5. Oxygenation: Wean as tolerated and extubate if tolerates. ABG today, decrease sedation to prepare for extubation, attempt extubation today, if appropriate, pull PA catheter today once alternate peripheral access established.
6. Multiple sclerosis: Continue outpatient regimen of dextroamphetamine, oxcarbazepine, primidone, oxybutynin.
7. Depression: Continue celexa.

The patient was successfully extubated and experienced hypertension with an elevated heart rate, leading to an increase in Metoprolol dosage from 25mg to 37.6mg TID. The patient appears fluid overloaded, but their blood pressure is in the 90s with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s. Lasix 20mg IV was administered as an extra dose tonight.

The patient has allergies to Captopril and Macroglossia/A. The last dose of antibiotics, Ciprofloxacin, was given on [**2176-11-2**] at 06:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving insulin (Regular) at a rate of 2 units/hour, famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), and dextrose 50%.

There are no changes reported in the patient's medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

   66-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes x (HbA1c 7.6 in [**8-7**],
   complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and
   severe Charcot foot deformities), peripheral vascular disease status
   post right popliteal-->DP bypass from [**6-6**], two-vessel
   coronary disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent
   placed to RCA, intubated, no longer on pressors, no longer with balloon
   pump in place.
   .
   # Hypoxic episode:  Given CXR
   - Diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV today
   - Vancomycin/Cefepime/Ciprofloxacin to cover for VAP, renally dosed
   - CXR tomorrow to monitor interval change
   # CORONARIES:  Inferior MI, s/p bare metal stent placed to RCA. Patient
   previously on a balloon pump, removed yesterday successfully (no longer
   on heparin gtt). Was hypotensive in the cath lab, intubated, and
   started on dopamine gtt (came off dopamine gtt overnight and doing well
   with BP since then).
   -restart dopamine gtt if needed to tolerate MAP>55
   -bolus 200 ccs for RA pressures <[**11-14**]
   -Continue ASA 325mg po daily and now (post plavix load of 600mg)
   continue plavix 75mg po daily for 1 year.
   -Dobhoff if pt cannot take ASA, plavix
   -restart metoprolol tartrate 25mg po bid, now that dopamine weaned off
   and BPs doing well
   -consider Lisinopril tomorrow if BP tolerates
   -continue simvastatin 80mg po daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic episode and underwent invasive ventilation and PA catheter placement. The patient had an inferior myocardial infarction with bare metal stent placement in the right coronary artery and was on a balloon pump. She was hypotensive in the cath lab, intubated, and started on dopamine gtt. The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled since then.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, ASA, Plavix, simvastatin, and insulin gtt for hyperglycemia management. She is also on diuresis with Lasix IV due to fluid overload and has been extubated successfully. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 140/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelets. The patient's kidney function is within normal limits. She has an elevated anion gap, likely due to her type 1 diabetes.

","The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a medical history of type 1 diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease status post right popliteal artery bypass, and two-vessel coronary disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placement in the RCA. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic episode and is currently extubated, off pressors, and no longer on a balloon pump.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxic episode: The patient experienced a hypoxic episode, which was initially managed with oxygen supplementation and diuresis. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and further intervention may be required.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray showed signs of worsening pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring and diuretic therapy may be necessary to manage this condition.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including an inferior STEMI. Ongoing monitoring of cardiac function and adherence to antiplatelet therapy (ASA and Plavix) are crucial.
4. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation included hypotension and the need for dopamine infusion, indicating a potential episode of cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, along with appropriate hemodynamic support, is essential.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Initially, the patient had an elevated anion gap,"

   the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment plan.
   CC = heart attack
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 3446**] suffered an inferior wall myocardial infarction from a 100%
   proximal RCA occlusion complicated by an RV infarct and cardiogenic
   shock that was treated with a BMS.  Her course was complicated due to
   respiratory dependence from acute respiratory failure and requirements
   for an IABP.
   She has made a steady hemodynamic recovery.  She is better
   neurologically.
   Our plan includes continued diuresis, aggressive pulmonary toilets and
   stimulation of her cough.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI), which required a bare metal stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient also had a right popliteal artery bypass and two-vessel coronary disease. She underwent balloon pump support and was extubated on day 5.

24-hour events include an ultrasound that showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), blood cultures and urine culture collected, and the development of fever with a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's allergies include Captopril and macroglossia. She received antibiotics, insulin, furosemide (Lasix), and heparin sodium prophylaxis.

Physical examination findings include congested-sounding lungs with anterior auscultation, positive bowel sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and 1+ dependent edema bilaterally. Vital signs show a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 147/39 to 106/38 mmHg, heart rate between 73-88 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 15-35 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease status post right popliteal artery bypass, and two-vessel coronary disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placed to RCA. The patient was previously on a balloon pump but it was successfully removed yesterday. She was also intubated and started on dopamine gtt due to hypotension in the cath lab, but is no longer on gtt and has been extubated.

The patient has been experiencing hypoxic episodes and has shown signs of pulmonary edema on a recent chest X-ray. She has been treated with diuretics and antibiotics. Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and she has been diagnosed with hyperglycemia. She requires insulin gtt to maintain sugar levels in the target range. 

The patient's cardiac function is good with an EF >55%. She needs to be monitored on telemetry and continue with her cardiac medications. Her oxygenation has improved since being extubated, with SpO2 in the 90s. She is also receiving tube feeds and glargine at night.

Other medical conditions include multiple sclerosis and depression, for which she is continuing her outpatient regimens.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and severe Charcot foot deformities. She also has peripheral vascular disease and has undergone a right popliteal-to-distal perfusion (DP) bypass. Additionally, she has two-vessel coronary disease and has experienced an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) for which a bare metal stent was placed in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient was previously on a balloon pump but it was successfully removed yesterday. She was hypotensive during the catheterization, intubated, and started on dopamine. Now, she is no longer on pressors and has been extubated.

The patient is currently being treated for hypoxia with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, which were started on November 3rd. This antibiotic regimen is being continued for 8 days (14 days if MRSA). The goal is to achieve negative fluid balance by providing around 500cc to 1 L of fluids today, along with bolus Lasix. Blood gas analysis, repeat chest X-ray, and chest tube insertion are planned.

The patient's coronary arteries were affected by an inferior MI, which resulted in the placement of a bare metal stent in the RCA. She was previously on a balloon pump and is now off heparin. The plan is to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placement in the RCA. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension during catheterization, intubation, and dopamine infusion. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, hyperglycemia, elevated creatinine, and potential pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's recent hypoxic episode and CXR findings suggestive of pulmonary edema indicate a possible complication of heart failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and ICU stay, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is why she has been started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient's lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT, she is still being treated with diuretics and antibiotics as a precautionary measure.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels require careful monitoring and management with insulin therapy.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating fluid overload, which may contribute to her respiratory difficulties.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6984**] today and I concur with
   the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment plan.   My
   examination is consistent with the physical examination adopted in the
   above note.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 3446**] has MS and suffered an inferior wall myocardial
   infarction from a 100% proximal RCA occlusion.  She was treated with a
   BMS and her course had been complicated by a presumpted aspiration
   pneumonia and hypoxemia and manifest by a fever and leukocytosis.
   She is undergoing intensive diuresis to remove lung water and she is
   obtained the appropriate antibiotics for her presumpted pneumonia.
   Through all this, she has maintained a good sense of humor and
   outlook.
   Treatment plan was discussed with the patient.

   on:[**2176-11-5**] 20:10 ------
","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease status post right popliteal bypass from 6/6, two-vessel coronary disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placed to RCA. She is extubated, no longer on pressors, and no longer with a balloon pump in place.

The patient is currently febrile with an elevated white blood cell count, decreased oxygen saturation in the low 90s, and showing signs of hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The goal is to achieve negative fluid balance and wean off oxygen support.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including an inferior myocardial infarction treated with a bare metal stent. She was previously on a balloon pump but was successfully weaned off it yesterday. She was also hypotensive during the catheterization lab procedure and required intubation and dopamine infusion, but is now extubated.

She has a pump EF >55% and is being diuresed to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500cc to 1 L today. She is also on lasix drip to reach a goal of -1 L/day and started on hydralazine 5mg IV tid.

Her rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm and will be monitored on telemetry.

The patient has hyperglycemia due to type 1 diabetes, with an initial anion gap of 23 concerning for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which has closed with fluids. She is on glargine and insulin gtt to maintain sugars in the 150-200 range.

She has multiple sclerosis and is being continued on outpatient regimen oxcarbazepine and primidone.

She also has depression and is being continued on celexa.

ICU care includes nutrition through tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pulmonary edema, progression of VAP, worsening hypoxia, development of further infections, and potential cardiac issues due to her history of coronary artery disease."

She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Fever: The patient has a fever with a temperature of 101.2°F. This could indicate an infection or inflammatory process.

2. Hypoxic episode: The patient had a hypoxic episode, which may be related to pulmonary edema. She is being treated with diuretics and antibiotics.

3. Coronary artery disease: The patient had an inferior myocardial infarction and underwent stenting of the right coronary artery. She also had a balloon pump in place but was successfully weaned off it.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient is a type 1 diabetic, and her blood glucose levels were initially high, indicating possible diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Fluids were administered to correct this, and she is now being maintained on insulin to keep her blood sugar levels in the target range.

5. Oxygenation: The patient's oxygen saturation levels decreased to the low 90s, but they have improved with chest physiotherapy and supplemental oxygen. Monitoring of her SpO"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and severe Charcot foot deformities, as well as peripheral vascular disease status post right popliteal-DP bypass and two-vessel coronary disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placed to RCA. She was previously on a balloon pump, removed yesterday successfully, and extubated. She has been febrile with elevated white blood cell count, decreased oxygen saturation in the low 90s, and worsening respiratory symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's decreased oxygen saturation in the low 90s and worsening respiratory symptoms indicate potential hypoxia. Further assessment and management are needed to improve oxygenation.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest X-ray on [**11-3**] is concerning for pulmonary edema, and the CXR on [**11-5**] is worrisome for focal consolidations/pulmonary edema. These findings suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. Treatment with diuretics and careful fluid management is necessary.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory symptoms, there is a risk of VAP. Appropriate antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and the patient's sputum culture should be followed up to determine the speciation and guide further treatment"

   Disposition: CCU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with a medical history of type 1 diabetes, complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and severe Charcot foot deformities, as well as peripheral vascular disease status post right popliteal-->DP bypass and two-vessel coronary disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placed to RCA. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

The patient's recent events include a decrease in oxygen saturation levels to 92-93% on high flow face mask and NC, likely indicating respiratory fatigue. She has been coughing up grey/green sputum, which was sent for culture. The patient also had an increase in white blood cell count and fever, suggesting an infection.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.0 C (100.4 F)
- Heart rate: 88 bpm (76-180 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 131/46 mmHg (119/23-177/93 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (12-49 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL and potassium level of 5.2 mEq/L. Her blood glucose level has been fluctuating between 103 and 123 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Ciprofloxacin), diuretics (Furosemide), beta-blockers (Metoprolol), antihypertensives (Hydralazine), and insulin for glycemic control.

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Hypoxia: The patient continues to have low oxygen saturation levels and has been febrile. Chest X-rays have shown pulmonary edema and focal consolidations.
- Coronaries: The patient had an inferior myocardial infarction and underwent bare metal stenting of the RCA. She was previously on a balloon pump but it was removed successfully.
- Pump: The patient's ejection fraction is greater than 55%. Diurese as needed to achieve negative fluid balance and initiate Lasix drip to goal -1L/day.
- Rhythm: The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm. Monitor on telemetry.
- Hyperglycemia: The patient is a type 1 diabetic with initial anion gap of 23, concerning for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which closed with fluids. Continue insulin gtt to maintain sugars in the 150-200 range.
- Multiple sclerosis: Continue outpatient regimen of oxcarbazepine and primidone.
- Depression: Continue celexa.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to the possibility"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including type 1 diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and a history of an inferior myocardial infarction (heart attack) with a bare metal stent placed in the right coronary artery. The patient was previously on a balloon pump but it has been removed.

The patient presented to the ICU with hypotension and was intubated. She is currently extubated and no longer on pressors. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been low, ranging from 92-96%, and she is on high flow face mask with nebulized albuterol. The sputum culture is pending for speciation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated potassium levels. Her renal function tests are within normal limits. Her liver function tests are also within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating but are being managed with insulin.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, furosemide (Lasix), metoprolol, heparin, famotidine, and oxcarbazepine/primidone for multiple sclerosis. The patient is also receiving tube feeds due to difficulty swallowing.

The patient's plan includes continuing the current antibiotics for ventil"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including type 1 diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, severe Charcot foot deformities, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. She underwent right popliteal artery bypass surgery and had a bare metal stent placed in her right coronary artery following an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypoxia, febrile, elevated white blood cell count, and decreased oxygen saturation levels. She was previously on mechanical ventilation and a balloon pump but has been extubated and no longer requires pressors. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The chest X-ray findings on [**11-3**] and [**11-5**] are concerning for pulmonary edema. This condition can be caused by fluid overload, heart failure, or an infection.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and decreased oxygen saturation suggest an infection. The decision to start vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin is appropriate for covering VAP.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's type 1 diabetes and high anion gap initially raise concern for DKA. However, the anion"

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6984**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.   My examination is consistent with the physical
   examination adopted in the above note.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 3446**] 66 year old woman
   who diabetes mellitus and MS who suffered an inferior wall myocardial
   infarction from a 100% proximal RCA occlusion.  She was treated with a
   BMS and her course had been complicated by a presumed aspiration
   pneumonia and hypoxemia and manifest by a fever and leukocytosis.
   She is undergoing continued diuresis to remove lung water and she is
   obtained the appropriate antibiotics for her presumed pneumonia.  We
   are also working on getting her to increase her pulmonary toilet and
   tidal volumes.  Her WBC count is still elevated at 20K but her fever is
   improved.   She has developed a small pneumothorax in the left lower
   lobe
 we will manage her conservatively with oxygen therapy.  A CT
   chest will be obtained with clinical deterioration or increase in her
   fever and leukocytosis.
   We will proceed with cautious oral intake as tolerated.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and severe Charcot foot deformities. She also has two-vessel coronary disease and had an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with a bare metal stent placed to the right coronary artery (RCA). 

The patient was previously on a balloon pump and intubated due to hypotension during the cardiac catheterization. She was started on dopamine and eventually extubated. Her CK (creatine kinase) levels have peaked and are no longer following the expected trend.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxia, elevated white blood cell count, and decreased oxygen saturation levels in the low 90s. There is concern for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as evidenced by fever and focal consolidations on chest X-ray. Antibiotics have been initiated, and sputum cultures are being followed. The goal is to maintain strict glycemic control and fluid balance, with a target negative fluid balance of 500cc to 1 liter today.

The patient's coronary arteries show an inferior MI, which was treated with a bare metal stent. Her ejection fraction is >55%, and she will continue with diuretics as needed to achieve a negative fluid balance. She is also on medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and simvastatin.

The patient has multiple medical conditions that need to be managed, including hypoxia, potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), coronary artery disease, and hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema or VAP, further deterioration of cardiac function, and uncontrolled hyperglycemia.

The patient's current treatment plan includes antibiotics for VAP, diuretics to manage fluid balance, and adjustments to her insulin regimen to maintain glycemic control. The patient will continue to be monitored closely for any changes in her condition and appropriate interventions will be taken as needed."

   RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1.) PO trials of pureed solids and nectar thick liquids with NGT for
   primary nutrition.
   2.) Meds crushed in puree
   3.) Q4 oral care
   4.) 1:1 supervision with all PO intake to assist with feeding,
   alternate small bites and sips, and encourage slow hard swallows
   5.) Please consult Nutrition to monitor caloric intake and sugar
   levels, since the pt is diabetic and many nectar thick liquids have
   high sugar content

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and severe Charcot foot deformities. She also has peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and a history of inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with bare metal stent placement in the right coronary artery.

The patient was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia and respiratory distress, with decreased oxygen saturation levels. She had a CT chest showing widespread areas of airspace opacification involving the right lung, which has slightly improved over time. A new focal area of atelectasis has developed in the inferior lingular segment adjacent to the left basilar pneumothorax.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/39 mmHg to 142/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, regular respirations, and bilateral rhonchi.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Imaging studies reveal findings consistent with pulmonary edema and a basilar pneumothorax.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

   concur with the history, physical examination, and Medical Decision
   Making.   I examined Ms. [**Known lastname 3446**] with the housestaff.
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 3446**] 66 year old woman who diabetes mellitus and MS who suffered
   an inferior wall myocardial infarction from a 100% proximal RCA
   occlusion.  She was treated with a BMS and her course had been
   complicated by a presumed aspiration pneumonia and hypoxemia and
   manifest by a fever and leukocytosis.
   She has taken a turn for the worse over the past 12 hours due to
   progressive lung infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress
   syndrome (ARDS).   In close collaboration with her caregivers, primary
   physician and cardiology the decision was made to not perform CPR in
   the event of a cardiac arrest.
   Her condition is worsening with hypotension, bradycardia, and
   difficulty with oxygenation, and supportive care will be given.
   We will proceed with cautious oral intake as tolerated.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress with decreased oxygen saturation levels. This could indicate a worsening of the lung condition, possibly leading to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient's chest X-ray shows an area of lucency at the left lung base, suggestive of a basilar pneumothorax. If not monitored closely, the pneumothorax could progress and require intervention, such as chest tube placement.

3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-rays show widespread areas of airspace opacification involving the right lung, which may suggest pulmonary edema. This condition can worsen and lead to respiratory distress if not managed properly.

4. Infection: The patient has a history of fever, leukocytosis, and worsening lung infiltrates, which may indicate an infection. This could progress to sepsis or severe pneumonia if not treated promptly and effectively.

5. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of inferior myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. There is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, which can impact the patient's overall stability and prognosis.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient is a type 1 diabetic, and there is an ongoing concern for hyperglycemia. Poorly controlled blood sugar levels can contribute"

   An area of lucency is identified at the left lung base adjacent to the
   costophrenic sulcus, suggestive of a basilar pneumothorax. Widespread
   areas of airspace opacification involving the right lung to a greater
   degree than the left appear slightly improved in the interval. A new
   focal area of atelectasis has developed in the inferior lingular
   segment adjacent to the left basilar pneumothorax.

   worrisome for focal consolidations/pulmonary edema.   Pt had low grade
   fever overnight, worsening leukocytosis, decreased oxygen sats
   overnight.  PICC in place for abx.  ?Pneumothorax on CXR yesterday, CT
   surgery consulted and recommended monitoring with [**Hospital1 **] CXR, no need for
   chest tube at this time.
   - CT chest today to evaluate for ?pneumothorax and reason for worsening
   hypoxia
   - Vancomycin/Cefepime/Ciprofloxacin (start date [**11-3**]) to cover for VAP,
   renally dosed.  Will plan to continue for 14 days course for MRSA.
   - Continue Lasix drip for goal -1.5-2L today
   -Chest PT
   -Intubate if needed to maintain sats

   # CORONARIES:  Inferior MI, s/p bare metal stent placed to RCA. Patient
   previously on a balloon pump.  Was hypotensive in the cath lab,
   intubated, and started on dopamine gtt. No longer on gtt and extubated,
   pressures stable. CK has peaked, no longer following.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix (x1 year), Metoprolol (50mg tid), Simvastatin
   (80mg daily)
   - No ACE inhibitor due to allergy (angioedema)

   initially, concerning for DKA, closed with fluids.  Also on tube feeds
   as found to be too sedated/sleepy to swallow appropriately PO, speech
   and swallow recs as above, but NPO for now for tenuous respiratory
   status and possible need for intubation if pt becomes more hypoxic.
   -Continue insulin gtt

   Additional comments:
   Newly recognized AF
   S/P PCI of LCX - was felt to be tight and not revascularized OM grafts
   Now back in SR
   Would favor initiation of Sotalol 80 [**Hospital1 **] with plans to increase to 120

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. Some of these include:

1. Pneumothorax: The patient's chest X-ray on 11/6 showed an area of lucency at the left lung base adjacent to the costophrenic sulcus, which is suggestive of a basilar pneumothorax. This can lead to respiratory distress and decreased oxygen saturation levels.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-rays on 11/3 and 11/5 were worrisome for focal consolidations/pulmonary edema. If left untreated, this can progress to severe respiratory distress and acute respiratory failure.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown worsening leukocytosis, decreased oxygen saturation levels, and low-grade fever. These symptoms are concerning for the development of VAP.

4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes, and initially had an anion gap of 23, which is concerning for DKA. Although the anion gap closed with fluids, close monitoring of blood glucose levels and acid-base balance is necessary to prevent the recurrence of DKA.

5. Hypotension: The patient was previously hypotensive in the cath lab and required the initiation of dopamine gtt. Hypotension can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and increase the risk of"
