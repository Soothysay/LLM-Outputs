   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital).
   .
   .
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI in
   conjunction with poorly controlled HTN. Based on Lesions on MRI most
   likely differential includes lymphoma, viral (toxoplasmosis), and PML.
   Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) also in the
   differential as well, although less likely. LP CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85
   lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162, and normal glucose in
   the 70s which makes bacterial/fungal sources highly unlikely.
   .
   --f/up neurology recs
   --continue Tylenol
   --follow-up final MRI read
   --consider full NSG consult / ? biopsy for firm diagnosis
   --keep goal SBP between 130-160s on NTG drip
   --consider MR spectroscopy for further assessment of the lesions & felt
   he would likely need biopsy for firm diagnosis.
   .
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**]
   .
   --f/up final MRI read
   --collect chemistries/LDH/CBC with differential (unable to get labs in
   ED)
   --call formal Oncology consult and f/up Heme/Onc recs in a.m.
   --consider biopsy/NSG consult for tissue biopsy to confirm if mass is
   lymphoma--> d/w Heme/Onc
   --intracranial edema noted, will discuss mannitol and increase
   glucocorticoids with NSG/neuro
   .
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons(likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Although not classical for PRES, given
   the possibility neurology team recommending goal SBP < 160 for tighter
   BP control. Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.
   .
   --continue NTG gtt with goal SBPs 130s-160s range
   --continue usual carvedilol, clonidine
   --will consider diuresis with mannitol as above, or additional ACE or
   CCB as he is weaned off NTG if needed
   .
   #Renal transplant: His creatinine was 1.7 yesturday near usual baseline
   of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression.
   .
   --consult renal transplant service
   --avoiding nephrotoxic medications
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --continue on Prednisone daily with Rapamune 2mg every other day
   --f/up sirolimus level
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   .
   --continue home lantus dose ( need to verify w/wife -dose?)
   --[**Name2 (NI) **] fingersticks with SSI coverage for now
   --continue diabetic/cardiac diet
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**]. No chest pain,
   EKG with no ischemic changes. He remains asymptomatic currently in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Aspirin on hold due to IT chemotherapy per OMR.
   .
   --repeat EKG
   --continue carvedilol
   --holding ASA, statin for now

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Malignant hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently experiencing worsening hypertension urgency. If left untreated or poorly controlled, this can lead to serious complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, or heart failure.

2. Bihemispheric white matter lesions: The presence of extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on the patient's brain MRI raises concerns for possible lymphoma, viral infection (such as toxoplasmosis), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Further evaluation, such as a lumbar puncture (LP) and follow-up imaging studies, is needed to determine the underlying cause of these lesions.

3. Headaches: The patient has been experiencing worsening headaches, which are likely due to multiple lesions noted on the brain MRI and poorly controlled hypertension. It is important to closely monitor and manage the patient's pain and blood pressure to prevent further complications.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone 3-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2013. Although currently asymptomatic, it is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's cardiac status, especially considering the use of chemotherapy"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and a history of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypertensive urgency, worsening headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Malignant hypertension (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency): The patient's blood pressure has been intermittently in the 170s over the last month, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This condition requires immediate medical attention to prevent end-organ damage.

2. Central nervous system involvement: The patient's symptoms, such as headaches and the presence of extensive white matter lesions on MRI, suggest central nervous system involvement. Differential diagnoses include lymphoma, viral (toxoplasmosis), and PML. Further evaluation, such as repeat MRI and CSF analysis, is necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

3. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Although less likely, PRES should be considered given the patient's poorly controlled hypertension and neurological symptoms. Immediate management of blood pressure and consideration of mannitol for intracranial edema may be required.

4. Renal transplant complications: The patient has a history of renal transplant and is on immunosuppressive medications. Monitoring renal function, avoiding nephro"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current assessment, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Malignant hypertension (hypertensive crisis/hypertensive emergency): The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypertension, with intermittent SBPs in the 170s. This puts him at risk for hypertensive crisis or emergency, which could lead to end-organ damage. The goal is to maintain SBP between 130-160s using nifedipine (NTG) drip.

2. Biopsy of the left parietal lobe: The patient is scheduled for a biopsy with possible revascularization (REVD) planned for the next day. This procedure carries the risk of bleeding, infection, or complications related to anesthesia.

3. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Although less likely, the presence of extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI and poorly controlled hypertension raises the possibility of PRES. This neurological disorder requires close monitoring and management.

4. B-cell lymphoma: The patient has a history of B-cell lymphoma, which may have contributed to his renal failure. Further evaluation and follow-up with oncology services are recommended.

5. Renal transplant complications: The patient's creatinine level is near his baseline range, indicating potential renal function deterioration. Close monitoring of renal function and avoiding nephrotoxic medications is crucial.

6. Coronary artery disease: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital).
   .
   .
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI in
   conjunction with poorly controlled HTN. Based on Lesions on MRI most
   likely differential includes lymphoma, viral (toxoplasmosis), and PML.
   Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) also in the
   differential as well, although less likely. LP CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85
   lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162, and normal glucose in
   the 70s which makes bacterial/fungal sources highly unlikely.
   .
   --f/up neurology recs
   --continue Tylenol
   --follow-up final MRI read
   --consider full NSG consult / ? biopsy for firm diagnosis
   --keep goal SBP between 130-160s on NTG drip
   --consider MR spectroscopy for further assessment of the lesions & felt
   he would likely need biopsy for firm diagnosis.
   .
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**]
   .
   --f/up final MRI read
   --collect chemistries/LDH/CBC with differential (unable to get labs in
   ED)
   --call formal Oncology consult and f/up Heme/Onc recs in a.m.
   --consider biopsy/NSG consult for tissue biopsy to confirm if mass is
   lymphoma--> d/w Heme/Onc
   --intracranial edema noted, will discuss mannitol and increase
   glucocorticoids with NSG/neuro
   .
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons(likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Although not classical for PRES, given
   the possibility neurology team recommending goal SBP < 160 for tighter
   BP control. Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.
   .
   --continue NTG gtt with goal SBPs 130s-160s range
   --continue usual carvedilol, clonidine
   --will consider diuresis with mannitol as above, or additional ACE or
   CCB as he is weaned off NTG if needed
   .
   #Renal transplant: His creatinine was 1.7 yesturday near usual baseline
   of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression.
   .
   --consult renal transplant service
   --avoiding nephrotoxic medications
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --continue on Prednisone daily with Rapamune 2mg every other day
   --f/up sirolimus level
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   .
   --continue home lantus dose ( need to verify w/wife -dose?)
   --[**Name2 (NI) **] fingersticks with SSI coverage for now
   --continue diabetic/cardiac diet
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**]. No chest pain,
   EKG with no ischemic changes. He remains asymptomatic currently in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Aspirin on hold due to IT chemotherapy per OMR.
   .
   --repeat EKG
   --continue carvedilol
   --holding ASA, statin for now
   .
   #Phantom limb pain: continue tylenol as needed, recently stopped taking
   Vicodin.
   .
   #GERD: continue protonix [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Access:  PIVs  x 2
   .
   #Full Code status, confirmed with patient

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma status post 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The patient is also a renal transplant recipient on immunosuppression medications.

The patient presents with worsening hypertension urgency, throbbing headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI. The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, viral (toxoplasmosis), and PML. The patient's CSF analysis shows elevated protein but normal glucose levels, making bacterial/fungal sources unlikely.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, blood pressure ranging from 150/48-185/106 mmHg, heart rate of 73 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is alert, oriented, and in no acute distress.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, supple neck, and warm well-perfused extremities. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and blood glucose levels.

The patient has multiple medical issues that need to be addressed, including malignant hypertension, headaches, potential lymphoma or other intracranial pathology, and renal transplant"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital).
   .
   .
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI in
   conjunction with poorly controlled HTN. Based on Lesions on MRI most
   likely differential includes lymphoma, viral (toxoplasmosis), and PML.
   Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) also in the
   differential as well, although less likely. LP CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85
   lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162, and normal glucose in
   the 70s which makes bacterial/fungal sources highly unlikely.
   .
   --f/up neurology recs
   --continue Tylenol
   --follow-up final MRI read
   --consider full NSG consult / ? biopsy for firm diagnosis
   --keep goal SBP between 130-160s on NTG drip
   --consider MR spectroscopy for further assessment of the lesions & felt
   he would likely need biopsy for firm diagnosis.
   .
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**]
   .
   --f/up final MRI read
   --collect chemistries/LDH/CBC with differential (unable to get labs in
   ED)
   --call formal Oncology consult and f/up Heme/Onc recs in a.m.
   --consider biopsy/NSG consult for tissue biopsy to confirm if mass is
   lymphoma--> d/w Heme/Onc
   --intracranial edema noted, will discuss mannitol and increase
   glucocorticoids with NSG/neuro
   .
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons(likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Although not classical for PRES, given
   the possibility neurology team recommending goal SBP < 160 for tighter
   BP control. Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.
   .
   --continue NTG gtt with goal SBPs 130s-160s range
   --continue usual carvedilol, clonidine
   --will consider diuresis with mannitol as above, or additional ACE or
   CCB as he is weaned off NTG if needed
   .
   #Renal transplant: His creatinine was 1.7 yesturday near usual baseline
   of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression.
   .
   --consult renal transplant service
   --avoiding nephrotoxic medications
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --continue on Prednisone daily with Rapamune 2mg every other day
   --f/up sirolimus level
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   .
   --continue home lantus dose ( need to verify w/wife -dose?)
   --[**Name2 (NI) **] fingersticks with SSI coverage for now
   --continue diabetic/cardiac diet
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**]. No chest pain,
   EKG with no ischemic changes. He remains asymptomatic currently in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Aspirin on hold due to IT chemotherapy per OMR.
   .
   --repeat EKG
   --continue carvedilol
   --holding ASA, statin for now
   .
   #Phantom limb pain: continue tylenol as needed, recently stopped taking
   Vicodin.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease (status-post 3V CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, and a renal transplant. He presents with worsening hypertension urgency, headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI. The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, viral (toxoplasmosis), and PML, as well as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
- Hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency): Goal SBP between 130-160s on NTG drip, consider full NSG consult/biopsy for firm diagnosis.
- Heme/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed, patient s/p 6 cycles of chemotherapy, follow-up final MRI read, collect chemistries/LDH/CBC with differential, call formal Oncology consult and f/up Heme/Onc recs in a.m., consider biopsy/NSG consult for tissue biopsy to confirm if mass is lymphoma.
- Hypertension: Continue NTG gtt with goal SBPs 130s-160s range, continue usual carvedilol, clonidine, consider diuresis with mannitol as above, or additional ACE or CCB as he is weaned off NTG if needed.
- Renal transplant: Consult renal transplant service, avoid nephrotoxic medications, trend BUN/Cr, continue on Prednisone daily with Rapamune 2mg every other day, f/up sirolimus level.
- Diabetes mellitus II: Continue home Lantus dose (need to verify w/wife -dose?), [**Name2 (NI) **] fingersticks with SSI coverage for now, continue diabetic/cardiac diet.
- Coronary artery disease: Repeat EKG, continue carvedilol, holding ASA, statin for now.
- Phantom limb pain: Continue Tylenol as needed, recently stopped taking Vicodin.

- Access: PIVs x 2.
- Full Code status, confirmed with patient.
- Disposition - [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] while control BP and switch to PO medications, then consider transfer to OMED service.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Malignant hypertension leading to hypertensive encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, or hypertensive heart failure.
2. Worsening of renal function due to hypertensive crisis or nephrotoxic medications.
3. Development of further neurological deficits or seizures due to the extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI.
4. Infection or bleeding complications from the planned neurosurgery or biopsy procedure.
5. Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias due to poorly controlled hypertension or discontinuation of aspirin and statin therapy.
6. Poor glycemic control leading to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and increased risk of clot formation.
8. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged use of stress ulcer prophylaxis medications.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and immobility."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital).
   .
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI in
   conjunction with poorly controlled HTN. Based on lesions on MRI most
   likely differential includes lymphoma, viral (toxoplasmosis), and PML.
   Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) also in the
   differential as well, although less likely. LP CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85
   lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162, and normal glucose in
   the 70s which makes bacterial/fungal sources highly unlikely.
   .
   --f/up neurology recs
   --continue Tylenol PRN pain
   --follow-up final MRI read
   --brain biopsy pending
   --keep goal SBP between 130-160s, will start carvedilol today
   .
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**]
   .
   --appreciate oncology input
   --f/up final MRI read
   --brain biopsy pending, heme onc recs methotrexate with dialysis if
   metastatic lymphoma
   --intracranial edema noted, no mannitol or steroids indicated at this
   time
   .
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons(likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Although not classical for PRES, given
   the possibility neurology team recommending goal SBP < 160 for tighter
   BP control. Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.
   .
   --hold nitro for now
   --continue usual carvedilol, clonidine
   .
   #Renal transplant: His creatinine was 1.7 yesturday near usual baseline
   of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression.
   .
   --consult renal transplant service
   --avoiding nephrotoxic medications
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --continue on Prednisone daily with Rapamune 2mg every other day
   --f/up sirolimus level
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   .
   --continue home lantus dose ( need to verify w/wife -dose?)
   --[**Name2 (NI) **] fingersticks with SSI coverage for now
   --continue diabetic/cardiac diet
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**]. No chest pain,
   EKG with no ischemic changes. He remains asymptomatic currently in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Aspirin on hold due to IT chemotherapy per OMR.
   .
   --repeat EKG
   --continue carvedilol
   --holding ASA, statin for now
   .
   #Phantom limb pain: continue tylenol as needed, recently stopped taking
   Vicodin.
   .
   #GERD: continue protonix [**Hospital1 **]

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma status post chemotherapy, and renal transplant. The patient presents with worsening hypertension urgency, headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency): The patient's blood pressure has been intermittently in the 170s over the last month. The goal is to keep systolic blood pressure between 130-160s. Carvedilol will be started today, and lisinopril and lasix will be held.

2. Heme/Oncology: The patient has a history of B-cell lymphoma diagnosed on [**1-/2185**] and has undergone 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Brain biopsy is pending. Methotrexate with dialysis may be considered if metastatic lymphoma is present.

3. Renal transplant: The patient's creatinine was 1.7 yesterday, near his usual baseline range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for immunosuppression. Consult renal transplant service and avoid nephrotoxic medications. Continue on Prednisone daily with Rapamune 2mg every other day, and follow-up sirolimus level.

   Assessment and Plan
   HYPERTENSION -- underlying HTN disease.  Improved control.  Now on
   clonidine alone, will add b-blocker.
   HEADACHE -- attributed predominately to hypertension.  Opening pressure
   elevated.  Concern raised for intracranial abnormalities (based on MRI
   new white matter lesions) -- possible lymphoma.  No evidence for
   meningitits or encephalitis by CSF analysis.
   CNS ABNORMALITIES -- predominately white matter abnormality, bilateral
   by asymetri (ex. right frontal and left posterior).  Neurology and
   Neurooncology services following.  Awaiting further CSF testing
   results.  Recommendation for further imaging
 head MRI and head CT.
   For Biopsy today.
   VENTRICULAR ECTOPY --  non-malignant.  Consider resuming b-blocker for
   improved control.
   NIDDM -- continue usual insulin.  Monitor glucose.  Maitain <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of hypertension, which is being treated with clonidine. There are concerns about intracranial abnormalities, specifically possible lymphoma, as indicated by new white matter lesions on the head MRI. However, there is no evidence of meningitis or encephalitis based on CSF analysis. The patient also has CNS abnormalities with predominately white matter abnormalities, and further CSF testing results are awaited. A recommendation for additional imaging, such as head MRI and head CT, has been made, along with a suggestion for a biopsy.

The patient has experienced ventricular ectopy, which is non-malignant, and it is being considered to resume a beta-blocker for improved control. The patient also has NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and will continue usual insulin therapy while monitoring glucose levels to maintain them below 150 mg/dL.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and has multiple lines inserted. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prevention with an H2 blocker and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and systemic anticoagulation. The patient's head of bed (HOB) elevation is being used to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of their various medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital).
   .
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI in
   conjunction with poorly controlled HTN. Based on lesions on MRI most
   likely differential includes lymphoma, viral (toxoplasmosis), and PML.
   Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) also in the
   differential as well, although less likely. LP CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85
   lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162, and normal glucose in
   the 70s which makes bacterial/fungal sources highly unlikely.
   .
   --f/up neurology recs
   --continue Tylenol PRN pain
   --follow-up final MRI read
   --brain biopsy pending
   --keep goal SBP between 130-160s, will start carvedilol today
   .
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.

   --brain biopsy pending, heme onc recs methotrexate with dialysis if
   metastatic lymphoma
   --intracranial edema noted, no mannitol or steroids indicated at this
   time
   .
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons(likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Although not classical for PRES, given
   the possibility neurology team recommending goal SBP < 160 for tighter
   BP control. Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pressures improved with nitro and gtt
   dc
   .
   --hold nitro for now given stable pressures
   --continue usual clonidine, restart carvedilol
   .
   #Renal transplant: His creatinine was 1.7 yesturday near usual baseline
   of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression.
   .
   --consult renal transplant service
   --avoiding nephrotoxic medications
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --continue on Prednisone daily with Rapamune 2mg every other day
   --f/up sirolimus level
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   .
   --continue home lantus dose ( 22 U glargine)
   --qid fingersticks with SSI coverage for now
   --continue diabetic/cardiac diet
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**]. No chest pain,
   EKG with no ischemic changes. He remains asymptomatic currently in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Aspirin on hold due to IT chemotherapy per OMR.
   .
   --repeat EKG
   --continue carvedilol
   --holding ASA, statin for now
   .
   #Phantom limb pain: continue tylenol as needed, recently stopped taking

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL.
   .
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI rather
   than poorly controlled HTN.  Biopsy is concerning for tumor spread. LP
   CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162,
   and normal glucose in the 70s which makes bacterial/fungal sources
   highly unlikely.
   .
   --f/up neurology recs
   --continue Tylenol PRN pain
   --f/u final results of brain biopsy
   --keep goal SBP < 140 per neurosurg recs, will switch from
   nitroprusside to labetalol drip given risk of cyanide toxicity with
   continued use of nitroprusside
   --Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H, will hold prednisone for now but will need
   to restart once dexamethasone is dc
   .
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**]
   .
   --appreciate oncology input, will clarify recs regarding methotrexate
   and dialysis
   --steroids for intercranial edema
   .
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons(likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Although not classical for PRES, given
   the possibility neurology team recommending goal SBP < 140 for tighter
   BP control. Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pt arrived from the ED on nitro gtt.
   .
   --switch from nitroprusside gtt to labetalol for control of BPs
   --continue usual clonidine, hold carvedilol for now while on drip, plan
   to restart on DC if indicated
   .
   #Renal transplant: His creatinine was 1.7 yesturday near usual baseline
   of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression.
   .
   --appreciate renal transplant recs, will clarify use of CVVHD vs HD
   --IR consulted for eval for line placement
   --avoiding nephrotoxic medications
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --continue with Rapamune 2mg every other day
   --hold prednisone while on dexamethasone, will restart when
   dexamethasone course complete
   --follow  sirolimus level
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   .
   --continue home lantus dose ( 22 U glargine), may need to increase in
   the context of steroid use
   --qid fingersticks with SSI coverage for now
   --continue diabetic/cardiac diet
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**]. No chest pain,
   EKG with no ischemic changes. He remains asymptomatic currently in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Aspirin on hold due to IT chemotherapy per OMR.
   .
   --repeat EKG
   --continue carvedilol
   --holding ASA, statin for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma status post chemotherapy and kidney transplant. He presented with worsening hypertension urgency, headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, likely representing progression of his NHBCL. The patient underwent a brain biopsy which showed tumor spread. He also has a history of phantom limb pain and coronary artery disease status post 3V CABG. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant hypertension (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency)
2. Tumor spread to the brain
3. Potential risks associated with chemotherapy (e.g., infection, bone marrow suppression)
4. Complications related to kidney transplant (e.g., rejection, infection)
5. Complications related to coronary artery disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, unstable angina)
6. Complications related to diabetes mellitus II (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia)
7. Complications related to chronic kidney disease (e.g., uremia, electrolyte imbalances)
8. Potential risks associated with immunosuppression medications (e.g., opportunistic infections, increased susceptibility to malignancy)

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of lymphoma (cancer) who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypertensive crisis. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure, with readings ranging from 112/43 mmHg to 177/89 mmHg. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but their heart rate and respiratory rate are slightly elevated. Oxygen saturation is at 97%.

The patient has received various medications including acyclovir, Bactrim, nitroprusside, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,185 mL and output of 760 mL since 12 AM.

Physical examination findings are incomplete due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other parameters. Lab results indicate abnormal levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and other parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate a hypertensive crisis. If left uncontrolled, this can lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.

2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and presence of antibiotics suggest a possible infection. This could be related to the patient's immunocompromised state due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   HYPERTENSION -- underlying HTN disease.  Improved control.  Now on
   clonidine alone, will add b-blocker.
   HEADACHE -- attributed predominately to hypertension.  Opening pressure
   elevated.  Concern raised for intracranial abnormalities (based on MRI
   new white matter lesions) -- possible lymphoma.  No evidence for
   meningitits or encephalitis by CSF analysis.
   CNS ABNORMALITIES -- predominately white matter abnormality, bilateral
   by asymetri (ex. right frontal and left posterior).  Neurology and
   Neurooncology services following.  Awaiting further CSF testing
   results.  Recommendation for further imaging
 head MRI and head CT.
   For Biopsy today.
   VENTRICULAR ECTOPY --  non-malignant.  Consider resuming b-blocker for
   improved control.
   NIDDM -- continue usual insulin.  Monitor glucose.  Maitain <150.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for hypertension, headache, CNS abnormalities, ventricular ectopy, and NIDDM. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/43 mmHg to 177/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on multiple medications including nitroprusside, pantoprazole, and clonidine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with clonidine. There is a need for improved control, and a beta-blocker may be added. It is important to closely monitor the patient's blood pressure levels and adjust medication dosages accordingly to prevent complications related to uncontrolled hypertension.

2. Headache and Elevated Opening Pressure: The patient's headache is attributed to hypertension. The elevated opening pressure raises concern for intracranial abnormalities, specifically possible lymphoma. Further CSF testing results are pending, and additional imaging such as head MRI and head CT are recommended. Monitoring for signs of meningitis or encephalitis is also important.

3. CNS Abnormalities: The patient has predominately white matter abnormalities, which are bilateral and asymmetric. Neurology and Neurooncology services are following up, and further"

   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx on CVVHD to
   initiate chemotherapy.
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI rather
   than poorly controlled HTN.  Biopsy is concerning for tumor spread. LP
   CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162,
   glucose in the 70s.

   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.

   --Will consult with oncology due to difficulties in getting urine pH
   7.5
   --continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV q 6 hour steroids for intercranial
   edema
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons(likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Although not classical for PRES, given
   the possibility neurology team recommending goal SBP < 140 for tighter
   BP control. Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pt arrived from the ED on nitro gtt.
   --Continue labetolol gtt with 130<SBP<160 per neurosurgery recs.
   --continue usual clonidine, hold carvedilol for now while on drip, plan
   to restart on DC if indicated
   #Renal transplant: On CVVHD. His creatinine was 1.7 yesturday near
   usual baseline of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression. On CVVHD, 1.6L positive in past 6 hours, now with

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He has undergone a kidney transplant and is on immunosuppressive medications. The patient presents with worsening hypertension urgency, two weeks of throbbing headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, suggestive of tumor spread from his non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. 

The patient's current medications include sirolimus, prednisone, labetalol, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, pantoprazole, and an insulin regimen for his diabetes. He is also on CVVHD for renal support.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 112/46 mmHg to 172/65 mmHg, heart rate between 77 and 103 beats per minute, respiratory rate around 14-16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. His temperature is within normal limits.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while kidney function tests indicate impaired renal function. The urine analysis shows a specific gravity of 1.004, pH 6.5, and the presence of proteins and glucose.

The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of infection or distress. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves,"

 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx on CVVHD to
   initiate chemotherapy.
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI rather
   than poorly controlled HTN.  Biopsy is concerning for tumor spread. LP
   CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162,
   glucose in the 70s.

   --f/u final results of brain biopsy
   --keep goal 130<SBP<160  per neurosurg recs\
   --Consider discontinuing Labetolol drip and transition to Po meds
   --Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H, continue to hold prednisone
   discuss with NeuroOnc on course for Dexa.
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**]
   [**Name (STitle) 7093**] to start methotrexate once urine alkalization completed using
   CVVHD (now clotted off)
   --Will consult with oncology due to difficulties in getting urine pH
   7.5
   --continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV q 6 hour steroids for intercranial
   edema, f/u c neuro/onc
   --discuss heparin SC tid for DVT prophylaxis
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons(likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Although not classical for PRES, given
   the possibility neurology team recommending goal SBP < 140 for tighter
   BP control. Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pt arrived from the ED on nitro gtt.
   --consider changing labetolol gtt to PO equivalent with 130<SBP<160 per
   neurosurgery recs.
   --continue usual clonidine, hold carvedilol for now while on drip, plan
   to restart on DC if indicated
   #Renal transplant: On CVVHD. His creatinine was 1.7 yesturday near
   usual baseline of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression. On CVVHD, 1.6L positive in past 6 hours, now with
   new cough concerning for pulmonary edema [**3-14**] fluid overload.
   --10mg lasix IV x 1
   --Will continue with CVVHD, however will discuss with renal re:
   troubleshooting clotting
   --q2hour chem 10, ABG

   --continue with Rapamune 2mg every other day
   --hold prednisone while on dexamethasone, will restart when
   dexamethasone course complete
   --follow  sirolimus level
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   --calculate new lantus dose based on 24 hour insulin usage ( 22 U

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal transplant, and CNS lymphoma. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Key events and interventions include the placement of a dialysis catheter, initiation of continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHD) with bicarbonate to alkalinize urine, and conversion to CRRT due to clotted CVVHD circuit and new-onset chills. The patient has been receiving labetalol infusion at 0.5 mg/min for blood pressure control and calcium gluconate at 1.4 grams/hour for CRRT.

Laboratory results show stable kidney function with a serum creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, but elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 159 to 358 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating between 70-97 thousand/mm3, and his white blood cell count has been within normal range.

Physical examination findings include stable vital signs with blood pressure ranging from 112/46 to 172/65 mmHg, heart rate between 77-103 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU for hypertension, CNS abnormalities, and renal transplant. The patient has a history of diabetes, allergies to adhesive tape, and rashes. They are currently receiving multiple medications including labetalol, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and others. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly low blood pressure. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive intake of 2,207 mL and output of 2,160 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery but has an ABG indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient's labs show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, and leukocyte count, along with low platelet count and hemoglobin. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with high potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, CNS abnormalities consistent with lymphoma, and renal transplant requiring dialysis post-MTX to avoid renal toxicity. The patient is being managed with dexamethasone, chemo decisions being made, and considering dialysis. The patient's NIDDM is being managed with usual insulin and monitoring glucose levels. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension due to overaggressive blood pressure control.
2. Renal dysfunction or failure due to medications or underlying conditions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch male with a chief complaint of hypertension. The patient has been receiving dialysis since August 12th and has experienced several complications, including CVVHD clots, chills, and cough. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9 C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/46 to 172/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 2LPM. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received multiple infusions of medications such as labetalol and calcium gluconate (CRRT). The patient's labs show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and glucose, along with decreased levels of Plt and Cr. The patient has a history of renal transplant, hypertension, CNS lymphoma, NIDDM, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency or encephlopathy due to uncontrolled hypertension.
2. Infection or sepsis due to chills and cough, which could indicate a possible infection in the bloodstream or lungs.
3. Renal complications due to CVVHD clots, which may lead to further deterioration of renal function.
4. Thrombocytopenia, which could increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Hyperglycemia indicated by elevated glucose levels, requiring careful monitoring and management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, CNS lymphoma, renal transplant, thrombocytopenia, and NIDDM. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 112/46 mmHg, SpO2 of 94% on 2LPM, and sinus rhythm. The patient has extreme trace edema, and laboratory results show anemia, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is receiving CVVHD to avoid MTX renal toxicity and is on sirolimus and dexamethasone. The plan is to advance diet, maintain blood pressure control, start chemotherapy for CNS lymphoma, and monitor glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently low, which may require further management and monitoring.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the use of CVVHD and indwelling lines.
3. Bleeding: Thrombocytopenia puts the patient at risk for bleeding complications.
4. Renal dysfunction: Elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction, which may require adjustment of medications and further management.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels need to be monitored and managed to prevent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual who is currently in the ICU. They have a history of headache and lymphoma. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/46 to 182/74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including chemotherapy, antihypertensive drugs, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH level of 7.46, suggesting alkalinization of urine. The patient's physical examination is mostly within normal limits, with no signs of conjunctival pallor, scleral icterus, or edema. However, there is a mention of regular rhythm and normal rate, with preserved sensation throughout and 5/5 strength throughout. The patient's lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab values appear to be within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's high levels of potassium, phosphorus, and uric acid, along with low calcium, indicate the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome. This condition occurs due to the rapid breakdown of tumor cells during chemotherapy, releasing large amounts of potassium, phosphorus, and"

   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx on CVVHD to
   initiate chemotherapy.
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI rather
   than poorly controlled HTN.  Biopsy is concerning for tumor spread. LP
   CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162,
   glucose in the 70s.

   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes.  His usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons (likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Of note, he also had borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pt arrived from
   the ED on nitro gtt.

   D/C if indicated
   #Renal transplant: On CVVHD. His creatinine was 1.7 yesterday near
   usual baseline of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression. On CVVHD, 1.6L positive in past 6 hours, now with

 .H/O LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx on CVVHD to
   initiate chemotherapy.
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI rather
   than poorly controlled HTN.  Biopsy is concerning for tumor spread. LP
   CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162,
   glucose in the 70s.
   --f/up neurology recs
   --continue Tylenol PRN pain
   --f/u final results of brain biopsy
   --keep goal 130<SBP<160  per neurosurg recs\
   --Consider discontinuing Labetolol drip and transition to Po meds
   --Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H, continue to hold prednisone
   discuss with NeuroOnc on course for Dexa.
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**]
   [**Name (STitle) 7093**] to start methotrexate once urine alkalization completed using

   --continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV q 6 hour steroids for intercranial
   edema, f/u c neuro/onc
   --discuss heparin SC tid for DVT prophylaxis
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons(likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Although not classical for PRES, given
   the possibility neurology team recommending goal SBP < 140 for tighter
   BP control. Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pt arrived from the ED on nitro gtt.
   --consider changing labetolol gtt to PO equivalent with 130<SBP<160 per
   neurosurgery recs.
   --continue usual clonidine, hold carvedilol for now while on drip, plan
   to restart on DC if indicated
   #Renal transplant: On CVVHD. His creatinine was 1.7 yesturday near
   usual baseline of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression. On CVVHD, 1.6L positive in past 6 hours, now with
   new cough concerning for pulmonary edema [**3-14**] fluid overload.
   --10mg lasix IV x 1
   --Will continue with CVVHD, however will discuss with renal re:

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He has undergone chemotherapy and kidney transplantation and is currently in the ICU for worsening hypertension and headaches. The patient's medical history includes extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, consistent with tumor spread. He has received 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 2 cycles of intrathecal ara-C. The patient is on immunosuppressive medications for his renal transplant and has a history of phantom limb pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been intermittently in the 170s, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This can lead to end-organ damage, such as stroke or heart attack.
2. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma, which can cause tumor lysis syndrome. This condition occurs when cancer cells release their contents into the bloodstream, leading to electrolyte imbalances and kidney dysfunction.
3. Infection: Immunosuppression from chemotherapy and immunosuppressive medications can increase the risk of infection, including urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, and bloodstream infections.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's recent cough and fluid overload suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can be caused by heart failure or fluid overload.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, currently admitted to the ICU. They have a medical history of hypertension, CNS lymphoma, renal transplant, thrombocytopenia, and NIDDM. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and immunosuppressants. They are being supported with respiratory assistance via a nasal cannula and have been receiving CRRT with calcium gluconate and potassium chloride. The patient's vital signs show hypertension but otherwise stable parameters. Their flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which requires close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive therapy.
2. CNS Lymphoma: The patient's CNS lymphoma needs to be treated with chemotherapy, and there is a concern about the potential side effects and complications associated with the treatment.
3. Renal Transplant: The patient's renal transplant requires careful management to avoid complications such as rejection or toxicity from immunosuppressive medications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count needs to be monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent bleeding complications.
5. NIDDM: The patient's diabetes should be closely monitored to maintain glycemic control and prevent complications related to hyperglycemia.
6. ICU Care: The patient's ICU care involves managing their"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual with a weight of 8.7 g/dL. They have been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, CNS lymphoma, renal transplant, thrombocytopenia, and NIDDM. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments such as calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, acyclovir, pantoprazole, and others. They are also undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and CVVHD to avoid methotrexate (MTX) renal toxicity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 175/69 mmHg. If not managed properly, it could lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.
2. CNS Lymphoma: The patient has been diagnosed with CNS lymphoma, which is a type of cancer that affects the brain and spinal cord. If left untreated or not managed effectively, it can cause further neurological symptoms and progression of the disease.
3. Renal Transplant: As the patient is a renal transplant recipient, they are at risk of complications related to the transplant itself, such as rejection or infection. Close monitoring and immunosuppressive therapy are necessary to prevent these complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low (60 K/uL), indicating thrombocytopenia. This condition"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hypertension, CNS lymphoma, renal transplant, diabetes mellitus type 2, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications including antibiotics, acyclovir, pantoprazole, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and methotrexate (MTX).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature within normal range, heart rate of 80 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure reading 175/69 mmHg, and oxygen saturation at 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented but confused about time. Physical examination shows a well-healing biopsy wound, clear lungs, benign abdomen, and no edema in the extremities.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels have improved, with values ranging from 138 to 194 mg/dL. Kidney function tests show normal results. Other lab values including electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac markers are within normal range.

The patient's medical conditions include hypertension, which has improved with medication, CNS lymphoma, renal transplant, diabetes mellitus type 2, and thrombocytopenia. The plan is to continue managing these conditions with appropriate medications and interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypertension, infection due to immunosuppressive therapy for CNS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of renal transplant and is being treated for hypertension, CNS lymphoma, NIDDM, and thrombocytopenia. They are receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, immunosuppressants, and chemotherapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature within normal range, heart rate slightly elevated but within acceptable limits, blood pressure requiring medication management, and oxygen saturation at 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery. Fluid balance shows an intake of 8,902 mL and output of 7,383 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,519 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.48, which is slightly alkalotic. The patient's physical examination reveals an alert but confused state, clear lungs, and no edema in the extremities. Laboratory results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and Glucose, while other values are within normal limits. The patient is receiving CVVHD to avoid MTX renal toxicity and is scheduled for weaning off dexamethasone and restarting prednisone. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with plans for continued ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication management. If not properly"

   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy), s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx on CVVHD to
   initiate chemotherapy.
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI rather
   than poorly controlled HTN.  Biopsy is concerning for tumor spread. LP
   CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162,
   glucose in the 70s.
   --appreciate neurology/neurosurg recs
   --will discuss re-starting aspirin with neurosurg
   --continue Tylenol PRN pain
   --f/u final results of brain biopsy
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**]
   -- s/p methotrexate, continue to monitor urine pH (goal pH < 7.5)
   --d/ced dexamethasone, prednisone restarted
   --sirolimus level pending
   --check methotrexate q 24 hrs
   --q 4 urine pH, adjust bicarb as indicated
   -- f/u with renal transplant and BMT service regarding length of CVVHD
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes.  His usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons (likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Of note, he also had borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pt arrived from
   the ED on nitro gtt.
   --keep goal 130<SBP<160  per neurosurg recs
   --continue po labatelol and clonidine; off of labetolol gtt, will add
   hydralizine if BPs are not controlled, avoid gtt if possible
   #Renal transplant: On CVVHD for dialysis of methotrexate. His
   creatinine nl, good UOP. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression. Goal is fluid neutral per renal recs.  Unfortunately
   CVVHD has repeatedly clotted off.
   --Will continue with CVVHD, discuss with renal/BMT optimal length of
   treatment and possibility of switching to HD
   --switched from q4 to q 12 hr labs today, will confirm with renal
   --avoiding nephrotoxic medications
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --continue with Rapamune 2mg every other day

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU for worsening hypertension and headaches. The patient underwent a kidney transplant in the past and is on immunosuppressive medications. He received chemotherapy for his lymphoma but experienced complications leading to his current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient has high blood pressure readings ranging from 170s over the last month, indicating possible malignant hypertension. This requires immediate medical attention to prevent end-organ damage.

2. White matter lesions on MRI: The presence of extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on the brain MRI suggests possible tumor spread or other neurological conditions. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

3. CVVHD complications: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) for methotrexate removal. However, the CVVHD has repeatedly clotted off, which can lead to inadequate fluid removal and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and adjustments in the treatment are required.

4. Renal function: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored due to his history of chronic kidney disease, recent chemotherapy, and ongoing CVVHD. Changes in creatinine levels and urine output should be evaluated to ensure proper kidney function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of lymphoma and hypertension, currently admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to acute kidney injury. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to renal failure. He has been hypertensive and his blood pressure is being managed with clonidine and labetalol. The patient's methotrexate levels are high, and CVVHD is being used for fluid removal and medication clearance. The patient missed a dose of leucovorin, which is recommended by BMT to reduce methotrexate toxicity. The patient has an allergy to adhesive tape, resulting in a rash. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is consistently elevated, and there is a need to closely monitor and manage his hypertension to prevent complications such as intracranial hemorrhage, aortic dissection, or myocardial infarction.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is currently on CRRT. It is crucial to monitor his renal parameters and adjust the treatment accordingly to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
3. Methotrexate toxicity: The patient's methotrexate levels are high, and if not managed appropriately, it can lead to methotrexate toxicity, which may cause myelosuppression, mucositis, liver toxicity, or renal dysfunction.

   -- f/u with renal transplant service regarding length of CVVHD
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes.  His usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons (likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Of note, he also had borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pt arrived from
   the ED on nitro gtt.
   --labetolol gtt transitioned to PO equivalent with 130<SBP<160 per

   D/C if indicated
   #Renal transplant: On CVVHD. His creatinine was 1.7 yesterday near
   usual baseline of 1.6-1.7 range. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression. On CVVHD, 1.6L positive in past 6 hours, now with
   new cough concerning for pulmonary edema [**3-14**] fluid overload.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, coronary artery disease (status-post 3V CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHBCL) post-chemotherapy, and renal transplant. He presents with worsening hypertension urgency, headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, most likely representing progression of his NHBCL.

The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHD) due to renal failure. His blood pressure has been intermittently in the 170s over the last month, and his usual medications for hypertension (lisinopril and lasix) have been discontinued. He is also experiencing headaches and has a history of malignant hypertension.

Additionally, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had undergone 3-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2013. He is currently asymptomatic with no chest pain or ischemic changes on EKG.

The patient also has a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, for which he has received 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 2 cycles of intrathecal ara-C. His immunosuppression medications for renal transplant may have played a role in the development of malignancy risk.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 174/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. His general appearance is pleasant, well appearing, and in no acute distress. His neurological examination is essentially unremarkable, except for occasional confusion and disorientation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels are within normal limits. The PT/PTT/INR levels are slightly elevated, while the rest of the lab values are within normal range.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing Tylenol for headaches, following up with neurology recommendations, final results of brain biopsy, and keeping systolic blood pressure goal between 130-160 per neurosurgery recommendations. He will continue with po labetalol and clonidine, and off of labetolol gtt. Dexamethasone will be discontinued today. The patient's immunosuppression medications (sirolimus and prednisone) will be continued.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's intermittent blood pressure readings in the 170s indicate uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to hypertensive crisis if not managed properly.
2. Renal failure: The patient is currently on CVVHD due to renal failure. There"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of headaches, hypertension, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's current condition includes a high temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F) and a blood pressure of 134/50 mmHg. He is receiving intravenous fluids and has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with calcium gluconate at a rate of 1.8 grams per hour. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, maintaining an SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab parameters, such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium levels, are within normal ranges.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's high fever could indicate an underlying infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis or other infectious complications is warranted. Additionally, the patient's low blood pressure may necessitate further evaluation and management, possibly including additional fluid resuscitation or vasopressor support.

The patient's ongoing chemotherapy treatment for non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma puts him at risk for immunosuppression and opportunistic infections. Frequent monitoring of his immune parameters and vigilance for any signs of infection are crucial.

Overall, the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He presented with worsening hypertension urgency, two weeks of throbbing headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, which are most likely due to the progression of his non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. The patient is currently undergoing chemotherapy and has a history of renal transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's intermittent SBPs in the 170s over the last month indicate a risk for hypertensive emergency, which can lead to end-organ damage.
2. Tumor spread: The presence of multiple lesions on brain MRI and biopsy results are concerning for tumor spread, indicating possible central nervous system involvement.
3. CVVHD clotting: The patient's CVVHD has repeatedly clotted off, which may lead to inadequate dialysis and potential complications related to fluid and electrolyte imbalance.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to chemotherapy and renal transplant increases the risk of infection, including hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Medication interactions: The patient is taking multiple medications for different conditions, and there may be potential drug interactions that need to be monitored and managed.
6. Diabetic complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus II needs"

   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy), s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric

   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons (likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Of note, he also had borderline

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU due to worsening hypertension and headaches. The patient has been diagnosed with extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, most likely representing progression of his non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. 

The patient's current medications include sirolimus, prednisone, leucovorin, and various other medications for his medical conditions. He is also on CVVHD for dialysis of methotrexate. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing neck pain overnight, which is concerning for possible infection or abscess. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. His electrolytes are within normal range, and his glucose level is low. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing CVVHD until methotrexate level is less than 0.05, monitoring urine pH and adjusting bicarb as necessary, checking methotrexate levels every 24 hours, and continuing prednisone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and neck pain could indicate an underlying infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions and treatments. These include:

1. Infection: The presence of fever and positive urine culture for Enterococci suggests a possible urinary tract infection. The patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy and immunosuppressive medications increases the risk of infections.

2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient has a history of hypertension and intermittent blood pressures in the 170s. Discontinuation of antihypertensive medications (lisinopril and lasix) may contribute to this condition. The elevated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on TTE also indicates potential cardiac involvement.

3. Malignant hypertension emergency: Given the patient's severe hypertension and symptoms like headache, there is a concern for malignant hypertension, which can lead to end-organ damage.

4. CNS involvement: The extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI and the worsening headaches raise concerns about central nervous system (CNS) involvement, potentially due to tumor spread or other causes.

5. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and being on dialysis suggests ongoing kidney dysfunction. The clotted CVVHD and fluctuating creatinine levels indicate challenges in maintaining adequate fluid balance and managing methotrexate levels.

6. Cardiovascular disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous CABG surgery puts him at risk for cardiovascular complications"

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O HEADACHE
 .H/O LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy), s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx on CVVHD to
   initiate chemotherapy.
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**].  Will plan to continue CVVHD until methotrexate
   level is <0.05
   -- s/p methotrexate, continue to monitor urine pH (goal pH < 7.5) and
   adjust bicarb as necessary
   --continue prednisone
   --sirolimus level low at 3.6, pharmacy to redose
   --check methotrexate q 24 hrs
   --q 4 urine pH, adjust bicarb as indicated
   --continue leucovorin for total 12 doses
   .
   #Neck pain: Patient with new neck pain overnight in the paraspinous
   region.  Neck plain films were unremarkable.  Concern for MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
   infectious process, however pt does not have markedly increased temp or
   WBC.  Less concerned for meningitis given physical exam.  Pt does have
   dialysis catheter in place which could be contributing to his pain as
   well.  MRI of the neck would be helpful to assess for abcess however
   this is difficult while pt is on CVVHD.
   -continue to follow WBC, fever curve
   -will discuss with neurosurg
   -MRI if pt still symptomatic after CVVHD complete
   -benzos, oxycodone for pain
   .
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI rather
   than poorly controlled HTN.  Biopsy is concerning for tumor spread. LP
   CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162,
   glucose in the 70s.
   --appreciate neurology/neurosurg recs
   --continue Tylenol PRN pain
   --f/u final results of brain biopsy
   .
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes.  His usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons (likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Of note, he also had borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pt arrived from
   the ED on nitro gtt.
   --keep goal 130<SBP<160  per neurosurg recs
   --continue po labatelol and clonidine; off of labetolol gtt, will add
   hydralizine if BPs are not controlled, avoid gtt if possible
   #Renal transplant: On CVVHD for dialysis of methotrexate. His
   creatinine nl, good UOP. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression. Goal is fluid neutral per renal recs.  Unfortunately
   CVVHD has repeatedly clotted off.
   --Will continue with CVVHD until methotrexate level is <0.05
   --q6 labs
   --avoiding nephrotoxic medications
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --pharmacy to redose Rapamycin
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   --minimal insulin requirements o/n, will follow and increase standing
   insulin if indicated
   --continue ISS
   --continue diabetic/cardiac diet
   # Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**]. No chest pain,
   EKG with no ischemic changes. He remains asymptomatic currently in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Aspirin on hold due to IT chemotherapy per OMR.
   --continue PO labetalol, clonidine, add hydralizine if pressures remain
   poorly controled
   --holding ASA, statin for now.
   #Phantom limb pain: continue tylenol as needed, recently stopped taking
   Vicodin.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He presents with worsening hypertension and a two-week history of throbbing headaches. The patient has undergone six cycles of chemotherapy and two cycles of intrathecal ara-C. He also has a history of renal transplant and is on immunosuppressive medications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/53 to 201/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on CVVHD for dialysis of methotrexate, and his creatinine level is within normal limits with good urine output.

The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant and well-appearing individual with no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. His neck is no longer painful to palpation, and there are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops heard on cardiac examination. Lung auscultation reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. There is no peripheral edema or calf pain, and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2+.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHL), and kidney transplant. He presents with worsening HTN urgency, two weeks of throbbing headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI. The patient has been on immunosuppression medications for his renal transplant, which may have played a role in the development of malignancy. He has completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 2 cycles of intrathecal (IT) ara-C. His methotrexate level was below 0.05, leading to the discontinuation of CVVHD. He also has new enterococcus in his urine and consolidations on CXR, which are concerning for edema, infection, or methotrexate toxicity. The patient is currently on sirolimus and prednisone for immunosuppression, and his creatinine is within normal limits with good urine output. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a new enterococcus infection in his urine and consolidations on CXR, indicating a possible infection. It is crucial to treat the UTI promptly and monitor for any signs of systemic infection.
2. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's intermittent SBPs in the 170s over the last month and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on TTE suggest a hypertensive emergency. It is"

He has undergone chemotherapy and kidney transplantation and is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient presents with worsening hypertension, throbbing headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, which are most likely representing progression of his non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. The patient also has a dialysis catheter in place, which could be contributing to his neck pain.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.9°F, blood pressure ranging from 155/53 mmHg to 201/67 mmHg, heart rate between 75-95 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals neck pain upon palpation of the paraspinous muscles, regular rhythm with normal rate, clear lungs bilaterally, soft abdomen, and no edema or calf pain in the extremities.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a pleasant and well-appearing individual in the ICU for headache monitoring and chemotherapy. They have a history of lymphoma and hypertension. The patient developed a fever of 101.9°F and had blood cultures drawn from the dialysis line and arterial line. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.9°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/53 mmHg to 201/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 9,622 mL with outputs totaling 5,828 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of 7.47/45/76 with a PaCO2 of 31/8. Physical examination reveals neck pain upon palpation, regular heart rhythm, clear lungs, and no rashes or lesions. Neurological assessment is deferred. Laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's condition is complicated by hypertension and malignant hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest a possible infection, which could be related to the central venous catheters or other sources.
2. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's blood pressure readings are significantly high,"

 .H/O HEADACHE
 .H/O LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy), s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx on CVVHD to
   initiate chemotherapy.
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**].  Will plan to continue CVVHD until methotrexate
   level is <0.05
   -- s/p methotrexate, continue to monitor urine pH (goal pH < 7.5) and
   adjust bicarb as necessary
   --continue prednisone
   --sirolimus level low at 3.6, pharmacy to redose
   --check methotrexate q 24 hrs
   --q 4 urine pH, adjust bicarb as indicated
   --continue leucovorin for total 12 doses
   .
   #Neck pain: Patient with new neck pain overnight in the paraspinous
   region.  Neck plain films were unremarkable.  Concern for MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
   infectious process, however pt does not have markedly increased temp or
   WBC.  Less concerned for meningitis given physical exam.  Pt does have
   dialysis catheter in place which could be contributing to his pain as
   well.  MRI of the neck would be helpful to assess for abcess however
   this is difficult while pt is on CVVHD.
   -continue to follow WBC, fever curve
   -will discuss with neurosurg
   -MRI if pt still symptomatic after CVVHD complete
   -benzos, oxycodone for pain
   .
   #Headaches: Likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI rather
   than poorly controlled HTN.  Biopsy is concerning for tumor spread. LP
   CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162,
   glucose in the 70s.
   --appreciate neurology/neurosurg recs
   --continue Tylenol PRN pain
   --f/u final results of brain biopsy
   .
   #Hypertension: In regards to his HTN, it appears his SBPs have been
   intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes.  His usual
   lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons (likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Of note, he also had borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.  Pt arrived from
   the ED on nitro gtt.
   --keep goal 130<SBP<160  per neurosurg recs
   --continue po labatelol and clonidine; off of labetolol gtt, will add
   hydralizine if BPs are not controlled, avoid gtt if possible
   #Renal transplant: On CVVHD for dialysis of methotrexate. His
   creatinine nl, good UOP. He is on sirolimus and prednisone for
   immunosuppression. Goal is fluid neutral per renal recs.  Unfortunately
   CVVHD has repeatedly clotted off.
   --Will continue with CVVHD until methotrexate level is <0.05
   --q6 labs
   --avoiding nephrotoxic medications
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --pharmacy to redose Rapamycin
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   --minimal insulin requirements o/n, will follow and increase standing
   insulin if indicated
   --continue ISS
   --continue diabetic/cardiac diet
   # Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**]. No chest pain,
   EKG with no ischemic changes. He remains asymptomatic currently in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Aspirin on hold due to IT chemotherapy per OMR.
   --continue PO labetalol, clonidine, add hydralizine if pressures remain
   poorly controled
   --holding ASA, statin for now.
   #Phantom limb pain: continue tylenol as needed, recently stopped taking
   Vicodin.

   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx and MTX
   chemotherapy.
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**].  Methotrexate level <0.05 yesterday, therefore

   --continue leucovorin for total 12 doses, will touch base with BMT in
   regards to duration of tx (originally planned for 12 doses total)
   # Fever/elevated WBC: Pt with ampicillin sensitive enterococcus in
   urine.  On speaking with wife, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 3741**] has had 2 UTI
s, treated with
   ampicilin in past month, last treatment completed late [**Month (only) **].  Pt also
   has new consolidations on CXR concerning for edema vs infection vs
   methotrexate toxicity.
   - Continue Ampicillin
   - repeat sputum culture
   - follow WBC and fever curve
   #Thrompocytopenia: HIT negative, thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy
   unlikely due to timing.  Per renal, possibility that serolimus could be
   causing thrombocytopenia
 discuss with renal who mentioned possibility
   of switching to prograf.
   - Ok to resume heparin based on HIT, but would be cautious since
   platelets=25 and bleeding risk possible.

   #Headaches: Improved, likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI
   rather than poorly controlled HTN.  Biopsy is concerning for tumor
   spread. LP CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated
   protein of 162, glucose in the 70s.

   #Hypertension: Switched from Labetolol to Cardevilol yesterday due to
   low blood pressures (SBP in 100

   hours due to hold parameters.  On cardevilol 12. 5mg [**Hospital1 **] and Clonidine
   0.1mg [**Hospital1 **], now hypertensive.  As outpatient, previously on lisinopril
   and lasix, but have been discontinued for unclear reasons (likely
   related to his chemotherapies). Of note, he also had borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.
   --goal BPs 120s/80s
   --continue cardevilol and clonidine. Consider increasing cardevilol to
   improve blood pressure.
   #Renal transplant: Creatinine level rising, now 1.5, however baseline
   around 1.5-2. Considering he was on [**Last Name (LF) 446**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] expect creatinine to
   return to baseline.  UOP 30cc/h, on average, is adequate. He is on
   sirolimus and prednisone for immunosuppression.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma status post chemotherapy and kidney transplant. The patient presents with worsening hypertension urgency, two weeks of throbbing headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, likely representing progression of his non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.

The patient has multiple complications and comorbidities, including fever, elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, anemia, neck pain, headaches, hypertension, renal transplant, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and phantom limb pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an underlying infection. The presence of ampicillin-sensitive enterococcus in the urine also suggests a urinary tract infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 25,000/mm3, which increases the risk of bleeding. The use of heparin should be cautious due to this risk.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease and received a blood transfusion. Close monitoring of the hematocrit levels is necessary, and transfusion may be required if the levels drop below 21.
4. Headaches and brain lesions: The patient's"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma s/p chemotherapy and kidney transplant. The patient presents with worsening HTN urgency, two weeks of throbbing headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, most likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx and MTX chemotherapy.

The patient's current condition includes fever (101.3), hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neck pain. The patient's neck pain has resolved, likely due to MS in origin. The patient's headaches have improved, likely due to multiple lesions noted on brain MRI rather than poorly controlled HTN. Biopsy is concerning for tumor spread. LP CSF with 2WBC, 1RBC, 85 lymphocytes, 15 monos, elevated protein of 162, glucose in the 70s.

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including fever/elevated WBC (ampicillin-sensitive enterococcus in urine), thrombocytopenia (HIT negative), anemia (of chronic disease), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus II.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.3, blood pressure ranging from 164/69 to 99/32 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate"

   63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma
   s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy), s/p kidney transplant (on
   Rapamune & Prednisone) who presents with worsening HTN urgency and 2
   weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric
   white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital), most
   likely representing progression of his NHBCL now s/p bx and MTX
   chemotherapy.
   #HEME/Oncology: B-cell lymphoma diagnosed [**1-/2185**], patient is now s/p 6
   cycles of chemotherapy (R-[**Hospital1 **] x5, R-CHOP x1) and 2 cycles of IT ara-C
   with last dose given on [**2185-7-13**] per OMR. No radiation therapy. Patient
   had been on immunosuppression meds for many years for renal transplant
   which may have played role in malignancy risk. Followed here by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6604**] & Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3337**].  Methotrexate level <0.05 yesterday, therefore

   --appreciate BMT following
   --continue prednisone
   --Due to worsening thrombocytopenia, renal service recommends changing
   sirolimus to Tacrolimus.  Pt previously on tacrolimus but switched due
   to vasospasm? Will d/c sirolimus and start Tacrolimus 1 mg PO bid per
   renal recommendations.
   # Fever/elevated WBC: Pt with ampicillin sensitive enterococcus in
   urine.  On speaking with wife, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 3741**] has had 2 UTI
s, treated with
   ampicilin in past month, last treatment completed late [**Month (only) **].  Pt also
   had new consolidations on CXR ([**8-17**]) concerning for edema vs infection
   vs methotrexate toxicity.  Considering that UA
s have had no
   leukocytes, will consider other sources of infection if continues to be
   febrile.  Other sites include temporary R IJ hemodialysis catheter,
   proctatitis, or PNA due to cough.
   - Continue Ampicillin
   - repeat sputum culture
   - consider taking out foley due to positive culture
   - follow WBC and fever curve
   #Thrompocytopenia: HIT negative, thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy
   unlikely due to timing.  Per renal, possibility that serolimus could be
   causing thrombocytopenia
 discuss with renal who mentioned possibility
   of switching to prograf.
   -          Will not resume heparin based on HIT neg since platelets=25
   and bleeding risk possible.
   -          Switch rapamune to prgraf per renal recs
   -          Monitor platelet count daily
   -          Monitor for bleeding
   #Anemia:  Pt with anemia of chronic disease.  Received 1 unit PRBCs
   last night, hematocrit stable.  Guaiac negative, no active bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He underwent a kidney transplant and has been on immunosuppression medication. The patient presented with worsening hypertension, headaches, and was found to have extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, indicating progression of his non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. He has been receiving chemotherapy but continues to experience complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of urinary tract infections and enterococcus in the urine. He is also febrile, which may indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to chemotherapy or immunosuppression. This increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease and received a blood transfusion. Close monitoring of hematocrit levels is necessary.
4. Headaches: The patient's headaches have improved but may recur due to the multiple lesions noted on brain MRI.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is difficult to control, and he requires multiple medications to manage his hypertension.
6. Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is rising, indicating possible decline in renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters is necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHL) status post chemotherapy and kidney transplant.
- He presents with worsening HTN urgency, two weeks of throbbing headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, likely representing progression of his NHL.
- He has been on immunosuppressive medications for his renal transplant, which may have increased his risk for malignancy.
- The patient's neck pain has resolved, likely due to MS.
- His headaches have improved, possibly due to multiple lesions on brain MRI rather than poorly controlled HTN.
- A biopsy is concerning for tumor spread, and the patient will undergo further evaluation.
- He has thrombocytopenia, which could be caused by chemotherapy or sirolimus.
- His creatinine level is rising, but considering he was on methotrexate, it is expected to return to baseline.
- He has anemia of chronic disease and received 1 unit of PRBCs last night, with a stable hematocrit.
- He has a history of coronary artery disease and had a CABG in 2013. No chest pain, EKG with no ischemic changes.
- He also has phantom limb pain.
- The patient is on multiple medications, including flagyl for C. diff, famotidine, and other ICU medications."

   -- chronic H/As [**3-14**] brain metastases, controlled with oxycodone prn
   # Fever/elevated WBC: C. difficile toxin positive yesterday.  Pt with
   ampicillin sensitive enterococcus in urine.  On speaking with wife, Mr.
   [**Name13 (STitle) 3741**] has had 2 UTI
s, treated with ampicilin in past month, last
   treatment completed late [**Month (only) **].  Pt also had new consolidations on CXR
   ([**8-17**]) concerning for edema vs infection vs methotrexate toxicity.
   Considering that UA
s have had no leukocytes, will consider other
   sources of infection if continues to be febrile.  Other sites include
   temporary R IJ hemodialysis catheter, proctatitis, or PNA due to cough.
   - Continue Ampicillin (day [**3-26**]) for complicated UTI
   - d/c foley
   -recommend prostate US/ biopsy after acute issues resolve to f/u source
   of recurrent UTIs
   - continue flagyl (day 2)
   - follow WBC and fever curve
   #Thrompocytopenia: HIT negative, thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy
   unlikely due to timing.  Per renal, possibility that serolimus could be
   causing thrombocytopenia
 discuss with renal who mentioned possibility
   of switching to prograf.
   - Will not resume heparin based on HIT neg since platelets=25 and
   bleeding risk possible.
   - Switch rapamune to prgraf per renal recs, level pending
   - Monitor platelet count daily
   - transfuse 1 unit platelets now to pull IJ line and place picc line
   #Anemia:  Pt with anemia of chronic disease.  Received 1 unit PRBCs
   last night, hematocrit stable.  Guaiac negative, no active bleeding.
   -follow crit
   -transfuse for crit<21
   -active type and screen
   #Neck pain: Patient
s neck pain has resolved.   Likely MS in origin.
   Will continue PRN
s for pain.
   -- benzos, oxycodone for pain
   #Hypertension: On home medications of carvedilol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and
   clonidine 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **].  As outpatient, previously on lisinopril and
   lasix, but have been discontinued for unclear reasons (likely related
   to his chemotherapies). Of note, he also had borderline pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension on [**5-/2185**] TTE.
   --goal BPs 120s/80s
   --continue cardevilol and clonidine.  Transitioned PO clonidine to
   transdermal clonidine for better control
   -- HTN episodes seem more related to uncontrolled pain than inadequate
   BP medications
   -- d/c arterial line once adequate IV access available
   #Renal transplant: Creatinine level rising, now 1.5, however baseline
   around 1.7 Considering he was on [**Last Name (LF) 446**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] expect creatinine to
   return to baseline.  UOP 30cc/h, on average, is adequate. He is on
   sirolimus and prednisone for immunosuppression.
   --trend BUN/Cr
   --started rapamycin, level pending
   --d/c dialysis catheter today after platelet transfusion
   # Diabetes mellitus II: Etiology of his renal failure per OMR. Usually
   on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale. Followed by [**Hospital 294**] Clinic.
   Pt had episode of hypoglycemia on labs again this morning, however,
   change in glargine dosing was not updated in nursing [**Month (only) **].
 amp D50
   given.
   --d/c glargine secondary to repeat hypoglycemic episodes in the setting
   of poor PO intake
   -- continue SSI
   --continue diabetic/cardiac diet
   # Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**]. No chest pain,
   EKG with no ischemic changes. He remains asymptomatic currently in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Frequent PVCs on telemetry but patient is asymptomatic.  Aspirin
   on hold due to IT chemotherapy per OMR.
   --continue BP managment
   --holding ASA, statin for now.
   #Phantom limb pain: continue tylenol as needed
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: regular/ diabetic diet with supplements

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma status post chemotherapy and kidney transplant. The patient presents with worsening hypertension urgency, throbbing headaches, and extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI, likely representing progression of his NHL. 

The patient has been experiencing fever, elevated WBC count, and positive C. difficile toxin. He also has thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy, but it could be caused by sirolimus as well. The patient's neck pain has resolved, likely due to MS origin. His hypertension is being managed with carvedilol and clonidine. The patient's renal function is stable, and he is on sirolimus and prednisone for immunosuppression. He has diabetes mellitus type II and coronary artery disease. 

The patient has been experiencing phantom limb pain and has been given Tylenol as needed. He is currently in the ICU and is stable, ready for transfer to the floor."
