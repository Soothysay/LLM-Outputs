   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Had respiratory/cardiac (PEA) arrest on floor, was down for about [**3-24**]
   minutes, intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**], currently balancing
   single access with mild hypotension induced by sedation, currently
   responding to fluids
   - on fentanyl/midazolam boluses, instead of propofol
   - likely extubation tomorrow
   - pt. s/p head CT for anisocoria--> no acute findings
   - will need to f/u with oncology since it looks like his myeloma has
   returned, given his renal failure, electrolyte disturbances and
   increased kappa:lambda ratio
   - pt. still full code after initial family meeting, will need more
   formal onc input prior to next meeting

   Assessment and Plan
   S/P PEA ARREST
   PEA arrest likely precipitated by pulmonary arrest given rapidity with
   which normal heart function returned, no epinephrine. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-20**]
   secretions and mucus plugging, compromised airway in setting of
   decreased sensorium and altered mental status. Good oxygenation on
   arrival suggests this was not a primary pulmonary event; consistent
   with mucus plug/airway occlusion.
   - continued good oxygenation, patient weaned to PS overnight, with
   RSBI=64
   - hopeful extubation this morning
   - continue good suction
   - concern for further diminished mental status with difficulty
   controlling his secretions
   - treat C diff w flagyl/po vanc; pan-culture; follow micro closely
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Has had consultation and follow-up from neuro, with head imaging.
   Initial concern for infection causing his AMS, had a UTI on admission,
   however MS did not improve with treatment.  Neurology input with no
   clear cause, started on carbidopa-levidopa given his rigidity and
   tremor, which per neuro is not typical of essential tremor.  Had an LP
   that was negative for infection.  EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   but no signs of seizure.  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] was found to have
   anisocoria which is not documented in prior notes, most likely
   physiologic. However, in setting of AMS, difficult to rule out CVA.
   Infection vs hyperviscosity vs debility in setting of metabolic demand
   in an elderly patient, vs medications vs. possible parkinsons.
   - patient has continued to fail speech/swallow evals
   - treating C. diff; UTI was treated; re-send cultures in setting of
   decompensation
   C. DIFFICILE INFECTION
   Flagyl and PO vanc started.
   -          continue
   -          pan-cx for potential other sources of infection in addition
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA
   Getting 20 mg dexamethasone daily for 4 days. Patient with multiple
   markers of myeloma progression.
   - Getting tumor lysis labs given hyperphosphatemia
   - continuing dex
   - Primary oncologist not currently available; w/e onc fellow is
   emailing to try to get his involvement as early as possible; check in
   with onc team, make sure they follow while in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   - Anemia likely related to MM, and acute drop overnight from IV fluid
   administration, pt. received 5L o/n
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours
   given period of hypoperfusion; however, decrease of gammaglobulin
   production is likely only measure that is likely to help.
   -          f/u w primary oncologist
   -          appreciate renal f/u and recommendations
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   RVR briefly on arrival. Now in sinus.
   -          continue dilt
   -          monitor on telemetry

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient experienced a respiratory/cardiac arrest on the floor and was intubated. They are currently in the ICU with mild hypotension induced by sedation, but responding to fluids. The patient's myeloma has returned, along with renal failure and electrolyte disturbances. An oncology consultation is needed, and the patient's code status remains full code. The patient's altered mental status has not improved despite treatment for a possible urinary tract infection. Neurological input suggests possible Parkinson's disease or another cause for the rigidity and tremor. An EEG showed encephalopathy but no signs of seizure. The patient also has anisocoria, which could be physiological or due to a stroke. The patient failed speech and swallow evaluations and has been treated for Clostridium difficile infection. They are receiving dexamethasone for multiple myeloma progression. The patient's anemia and hyperphosphatemia are likely related to multiple myeloma. Renal failure is also suspected to be a result of multiple myeloma. The patient was briefly in atrial fibrillation but has returned to sinus rhythm. They are currently NPO due to failed speech and swallow evaluations. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU pending extubation and continued stabilization."

   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with history of multiple myeloma and with altered mental
   status complicating current hospitalization.  He was transferred to
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] ICU with PEA arrest with rapid return to spontaneous circulation
   with CPR alone and 2 minute event time.  He has had rapid move to
   extubation and did not have persistent hypotension but has maintained
   altered mental status across time.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   -Patient extubated without event in the setting of favorable
   oxygenation and limited impairment in ventilation
   -Good tolerance of extubation with maintenance of stable saturations
   and ventilation
   2)Altered Mental Status-Definative and single source not clearly seen
   despite extensive investigations.
   -Sinemet treatment in place
   -Thiamine
   -He does have altered pupil reflex
   -Will have to follow up on CT scan
   -Need neurology to evaluate patient and consider further interventions
   and imaging
   3)MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)--Clear worsening by
   parameters (Kappa/Lambda increased,  Increased Ca++) and concern for
   limited therapeutic options raised.
   -Dexamethasone to be completed today
   -Will need to discuss future treatment plan and prognosis with primary
   oncology team and family to guide therapeutic choices going forward.
   -Will transfuse PRBC today
   4)PEA Arrest-Trigger for this does appear to be most likely a
   respiratory source and perhaps triggered by hypoxia with bradycardia
   and progression to PEA arrest as the reversal was quite rapid with
   airway obstruction with secretions quite prominent following
   intubation.  CXR, eletrolytes all reassuring even immediately after
   event.
   -Will need to establish adequate plan for maintenance of patent airway
   -Will take humidified air to keep secretions movable
   -Will suction PRN
   -Will maintain npo
   5)C. Diff Infection-
   -Flagyl to continue
   6)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Persistent
   -Likely related to Myeloma for chronic insult

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, respiratory failure, and C. diff infection.
- He experienced a PEA arrest but was successfully resuscitated and extubated without event.
- The patient has maintained altered mental status, which has not improved across time.
- His respiratory failure is acute but not ARDS, and he tolerated extubation well.
- The altered mental status is definitive and single-source, but the exact cause is unclear.
- The patient has worsening multiple myeloma, with increased kappa/lambda levels and elevated calcium levels.
- There are limited therapeutic options for the cancer.
- The patient's PEA arrest was likely triggered by a respiratory source and hypoxia.
- The patient has an ongoing C. diff infection and acute renal failure, which may be related to his myeloma.
- ICU care includes maintaining a patent airway, providing nutrition, managing glycemic control, and administering medications for prophylaxis and treatment of infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there are complications related to his underlying conditions or if his airway becomes obstructed.
2. Altered Mental Status - The cause of the patient's altered mental status needs to be further investigated, and it may require additional interventions and imaging.
3. Multiple Myeloma - The patient's multiple myeloma is worsening, and there are limited"

      <10 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS.
      QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
      Further incubation required to determine the presence or absence of
      commensal respiratory flora.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH.
         MOLD.    RARE GROWTH.
   Imaging:
   CT Head ([**9-20**]): No acute intracranial process
   Chest X-ray ([**9-20**]): Small bilateral pleural effusions are new and left
   lower lobe atelectasis is worsened, pulmonary vasculature is engorged
   but there is probably not pulmonary edema. Heart size normal.
   Mediastinum not widened. ET tube and right subclavian infusion port are
   in standard placements and a feeding tube passes into a severely
   distended stomach and out of view.
   Assessment and Plan
   S/P PEA ARREST
   PEA arrest likely precipitated by pulmonary arrest given rapidity with
   which normal heart function returned, no epinephrine. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-20**]
   secretions and mucus plugging, compromised airway in setting of
   decreased sensorium and altered mental status. Good oxygenation on
   arrival suggests this was not a primary pulmonary event; consistent
   with mucus plug/airway occlusion.  Additionally large volume of
   secretions in the back of his throat and large mucus plug post
   intubation suction leads to a mucus plug being the most likely etiology
   - continue good suction
   - concern for further diminished mental status with difficulty
   controlling his secretions
   - treat C diff w flagyl/po vanc-though unlikely related to AMS
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Has had consultation and follow-up from neuro, with head imaging.
   Initial concern for infection causing his AMS, had a UTI on admission,
   however MS did not improve with treatment.  Neurology input with no
   clear cause, started on carbidopa-levidopa given his rigidity and
   tremor, which per neuro is not typical of essential tremor.  Had an LP
   that was negative for infection.  EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   but no signs of seizure.  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] was found to have
   anisocoria, which is resolving, per neuro as long as his pupils remain
   reactive no further scans needed.  Infection vs hyperviscosity vs
   debility in setting of metabolic demand in an elderly patient, vs
   medications vs. parkinsons progression
   - per primary team neuro diagnosed him with Parkinson
s, will contine
   carbidopa-levidopa
   - patient has continued to fail speech/swallow evals, but will c/s
   nutrition for dobhoff feeds
   - treating C. diff; new cultures all negative
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA
    Patient with multiple markers of myeloma progression.
   - completed 4 days of dexamethasone
   - Primary oncologist not currently available; will try to set up a
   family meeting early the week to discuss further goals of care and
   overall prognosis with MM as per family
s request
   - Anemia likely related to MM, and acute drop overnight from IV fluid
   administration, pt. received 5L over the weekend, will transfuse 1unit
   PRBC
s since his HCT had been dropping prior to transfer
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
   Concern by the primary team for possible HIT since his platelets have
   dropped from 253 now down to 36 today, which makes HIT less likely.
   Also concern that since his multiple myeloma has been progressing that
   his bone marrow is infiltrated with malignancy and unable to produce
   platelets appropriately.
   - Most likely related to multiple myeloma, no current signs of bleeding
   so no platelet transfusions at this time
   - HIT negative
   - will hold SQ heparin b/c his platelet count is so low
   - if patient will need any procedures then he will need platelet
   transfusions
   C. DIFFICILE INFECTION
   -Continue IV Flagyl and add po vanc
   -Will recheck lactate and if it has become elevated will get a repeat
   CT scan
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours
   given period of hypoperfusion; however, decrease of gammaglobulin
   production is likely only measure that is likely to help.
   - will start allopurinol given increased uric acid and IVF with bicarb
   to alkalinize his urine
   - appreciate renal f/u and recommendations
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   RVR briefly on arrival. Now in sinus.
   -          continue dilt

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, Parkinson's disease, and recent PEA arrest. He has been intubated and is currently in the ICU. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has difficulty controlling his secretions. His laboratory results show elevated creatinine and phosphate levels, indicating renal failure. He also has anemia and thrombocytopenia. The patient is being treated for C. difficile infection and has been started on carbidopa-levodopa for Parkinson's disease. Imaging studies show small bilateral pleural effusions and worsening left lower lobe atelectasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the worsening left lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions, there is a risk of further respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory effort is essential.
2. Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine and phosphate levels suggest acute renal failure. This may be related to multiple myeloma, hypoperfusion, or other factors. Continuous renal monitoring and further evaluation by the renal team are necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has significantly dropped, indicating thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and considering platelet transfusions if necessary.
4. Infection: The patient has been treated for C. difficile infection. Close"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, and allergies to aspirin, nausea/vomiting, and metronidazole. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely caused by mucus plugging and airway obstruction. The patient has since been extubated and is now on supplemental oxygen via a face tent.

The patient's current conditions include altered mental status (AMS), C. difficile infection, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyperphosphatemia, and anemia. AMS may be related to infection, hyperviscosity, debility, metabolic demand, medications, or possible Parkinson's disease. The patient has multiple markers of myeloma progression and is receiving dexamethasone for multiple myeloma treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 139/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine, phosphorus, potassium, and uric acid levels, as well as a low platelet count.

   ====================
   Hemodynamics stable post arrest. Oxygenation stable following
   extubation. In retrospect, PEA arrest presumed secondary to hypoxemia
   from mucus plug.
   Continues treatment for C Diff with flagyl. With evidence of colitis on
   prior CT and what may be peristent abdominal pain, will start on oral
   vanco.
   Creat stable. Mild acidosis likely due to renal failure. Disease
   probably secondary to myeloma. Allopurinol started.
   Hct 25 following transfusion. No evidence of acute bleeding. Not at
   transfusion threshold now.
   Platelets continue to fall. HIT antibody pending. Not at transfusion
   threshold.
   Heart rate well controlled on diltiazem.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, renal failure, anemia, acidosis, and C. diff infection. He presented to the ICU with cardiac arrest, acute respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient was successfully resuscitated and extubated, with stable respiratory status and near baseline mental status. The patient has a history of aspirin allergy and has been treated with antibiotics for C. diff infection. He is currently receiving various medications including insulin, flagyl, diltiazem, and allopurinol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced acute respiratory failure, which could potentially recur if his respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that can cause complications such as renal failure and impaired immune function.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which can increase the risk of delirium, confusion, and poor decision-making.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, or high sodium levels, which can cause dehydration and neurological complications.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
7. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm that can increase the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications.
8. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which could recur if underlying cardiac conditions are not properly managed.
9. Clostridium Difficile (C. diff) Infection: The patient has a C. diff infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea and colitis.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.

Overall, the patient faces multiple potential medical complications that require close monitoring and appropriate management in the ICU."
