   # Pyelonephrosis with hydronephrosis: s/p percutaneous nephostomy
   drainage and tube in IR prior to MICU admission
   history of VRE and ESBL/Klebsiella UTI. Covered with vanc/cefepime
   overnight with one fever spike. No evidence of septic physiology
   overnight.
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime overnight but call for rush on Ucx
   speciation and sensitivities to tailor abx. Can consider dapto or gent
   to cover for VRE or ESBL if any fever spike, evidence of decompensation
   - urology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u UCx
   - f/u final read CT abd/pelvis
   .
   # Hypoxia: Resolving. Weaned down to 2L NC overnight. Likely episode
   prior to admission was in setting of fluid overload and positioning.
   - wean down O2 requirement as tolerated
   - renal HD aware
 plan for HD today
   - f/u repeat CXR in AM
   - if patient's mental status not improved in AM, get ABG to assess pCO2
   level
   - monitor closely for other evidence of infection
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely in setting of infection. CT head
   without any intracranial abnormality. Patient with continued R hand
   tremors but no evidence of seizures overnight. Should try to obtain
   baseline by family member today. [**Name2 (NI) 1424**] and urine tox screen negative.
   TSH, B12 normal.
   - treat infection with antibiotics as above
   - avoid sedating medications
   - hold home gabapentin for now
   - NPO overnight while mental status clears
   - if mental status doesn't clear overnight or patient with continued
   tremor, shaking, can consider EEG for eval of seizure

   # HTN: BP normalized over course of night with labetalol 10mg IV x 3.
   BP likely high in setting of not taking oral hypertensives and also
   being due for HD. Review of outpatient records showed that patient can
   be 180s SBP prior to HD
   - IV labetalol Q6hr with hold parameters
   - switch back PO meds when taking POs (carvedilol and lisinopril)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis via right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis post percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage, and previous ventilator-associated respiratory infection. She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypoxia. 

The patient presented with fever and altered mental status, which was later attributed to an infection. She had a urinary catheter in place and a percutaneous nephrostomy tube for pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis. Blood cultures were drawn, and she was started on vancomycin and cefepime empiric antibiotic coverage. 

Her vital signs were stable, but she required supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. She had a history of resistant urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the past, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella UTI. 

The patient's mental status improved overnight, and her oxygen requirement decreased. She will continue to receive vancomycin and cefepime, with plans to tailor antibiotic therapy based on the results of urine culture sensitivities. 

Other issues include hypoxia, which was likely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, resistant urinary tract infections, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis via right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula, diastolic congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented with fever and altered mental status, and was found to have pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis. She underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage by interventional radiology and was sent to the medical intensive care unit for hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of resistant urinary tract infections and is currently being treated with antibiotics. She also has a fever, which may indicate an ongoing infection. There is a concern for sepsis or septic shock, especially given her altered mental status.
2. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with hypoxia, which has since resolved. However, she may still be at risk for further episodes of low oxygen levels.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded based on her physical examination findings. This can increase the risk of complications such as pulmonary edema and worsening heart failure.
4. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, and her current condition may exacerbate this condition. Close monitoring of her cardiac status is important.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of resistant UTIs, and currently presents with fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism and determine its antibiotic sensitivities. She is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime), but may require additional coverage for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella if she develops a fever spike or shows signs of decompensation.

2. Hypoxia: The patient initially required supplemental oxygen due to hypoxia, but her oxygen requirement has been weaned down to 2 liters nasal cannula (NC). It is important to continue monitoring her oxygen saturation and"

   - renal HD aware
 plan for HD today
   - epeat CXR in AM with e/o edema
   - monitor closely for other evidence of infection
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely from new infection. CT head
   without any intracranial abnormality. Patient with continued R hand
   tremors but no evidence of seizures overnight. Older CVA and has some
   mental status baseline impatirments.. Serum and urine tox screen
   negative. TSH, B12 normal.
   - Should try to obtain better mental status baseline by family member
   today
   - treat infection with antibiotics as above
   - avoid sedating medications
   - hold home gabapentin for now
   - NPO overnight while mental status clears
 will plan to advance her to
   POs today now that AMS better
   -.
   # ESRD on HD
   - Renal HD following. Patient normally MWF schedule - seems volume
   overloaded on exam, will need HD today
   - continue nephrocaps and sevelamer once taking POs
   .
   # HTN: BP normalized over course of night with labetalol 10mg IV x 3.
   BP likely high in setting of not taking oral hypertensives and also
   being due for HD. Review of outpatient records showed that patient can
   be 180s SBP prior to HD
   - IV labetalol Q6hr with hold parameters
   - switch back PO meds today now that can take POs (carvedilol and
   lisinopril)

   Assessment and Plan
   71F with HTN, DM II, h/o resistant UTIs in past, ESRD on HD via RUE
   AVF, diastolic CHF, CAD, presented to the [**Hospital1 54**] ED with reported fever
   to 104F and altered mental status found to have UTI with upper tract
   obstruction and hydronephrosis s/p percutaneous nephostomy tube
   drainage by IR and sent to MICU for hypoxia.
   .
   # UTI with pyelonephrosis with hydronephrosis: s/p percutaneous
   nephostomy drainage and tube in IR prior to MICU admission
   history of ESBL/Klebsiella UTI, and MRSA line infection. Has had no
   indications for septic physiology so far (no leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   documented fever, hypotension, etc). Lactate normal.  But monitor BP,
   UOP (however, patient makes scant urine at baseline), vitals closely
   overnight
   - cover with vancomycin and cefepime overnight. If any fever spike,
   evidence of decompensation, can add on daptomycin to cover for VRE that
   patient had in the past and gentamycin for klebsiella
   - urology following, appreciate recs
   - send repeat UCx from foley and percutaneous nephostomy drain
   - f/u UCx and BCx from ED and tailor accordingly
   - f/u final read CT abd/pelvis
   - follow nephrostomy tube drainage and tube care recs per IR
   - monitor BP (has been hypertensive) and make sure MAP>65 and bolus prn
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient with reported hypoxia during IR procedure while in
   prone position, likely hypoxia in setting of fluid bolus, positioning,
   and prior to HD due the next day. CXR with evidence of mild fluid
   overload. No evidence of PNA on CXR in ED. PE also on differential,
   however, no tachycardia or evidence of right heart strain on EKG
   - wean down O2 requirement as tolerated
   - renal HD involved, may need volume removal at HD
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - if patient's mental status not improved in AM, get ABG to assess pCO2
   level
   - monitor closely for other evidence of infection
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely in setting of infection. CT head
   without any intracranial abnormality. Also on differential is seizure
   (patient with some tremors in right hand) with episode of incontinence.
   Will also check electrolytes, check reversible causes of dementia.
   Difficult to assess mental status as patient still waking up from
   sedating medications from procedure.
   - treat infection with antibiotics as above
   - add on serum and urine tox
   - check TSH, B12, RPR
   - avoid sedating medications
   - hold home gabapentin for now
   - NPO overnight while mental status clears
   - if mental status doesn't clear overnight or patient with continued
   tremor, shaking, can consider EEG for eval of seizure
   .
   # ESRD on HD
   - Renal HD following. Patient normally MWF schedule - seems volume
   overloaded on exam, will need HD tomorrow (Monday)
   - continue nephrocaps and sevelamer when taking POs
   .
   # HTN: Patient with elevated BP upon admission. Likely in setting of
   IVF in ED and not taking home oral hypertensives but trending upwards
   to SBP 190s with some agitation. Review of outpatient records showed
   that patient can be 180s SBP prior to HD
   - IV labetalol Q6hr with goal SBP 160s overnight, can also try hydral
   prn
   - add back PO meds when taking POs
   - will have fluid removal at HD
   .
   # DM: On NPH at home, but currently NPO
   - cover with HISS
   .
   # CAD: No evidence of chest pain, EKG changes.
   - while patient unable to take pills overnight, cover with IV
   metoprolol
   - continue home ASA, carvedilol, lisinopril, and statin when taking POs
   - AM ECG
   .
   # diastolic CHF: last TTE showing no clot and normal EF. Patient
   slightly hypervolemic on exam
   - volume removal at HD tomorrow
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Constipation: Patient with fecal impaction seen in CT. Also will f/u
   on possible anal abcess
   - f/u final read CT abd/pelvis
   - aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, dulcolax for now. Can
   add lactulose prn
   - rectal exam
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency department with reported fever to 104F and altered mental status. She was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) with upper tract obstruction and hydronephrosis, which was managed by percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage. She was then sent to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UTI with pyelonephritis: The patient has a history of resistant UTIs and previous infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/Klebsiella and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She currently has a UTI, and there is a concern for progression to pyelonephritis given the presence of hydronephrosis and the history of upper tract obstruction.
2. Hypoxia: The patient experienced hypoxia during the interventional radiology (IR) procedure while in the prone position. This may be due to fluid overload, positioning, or impending hemodialysis. Monitoring and adjusting oxygen requirements, performing repeat chest X-rays, and considering volume removal during hemodialysis are necessary.
3. Altered mental status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She was admitted to the ICU after presenting with acute-on-chronic mental status changes and fevers. The patient also has a history of hydronephrosis, for which she underwent a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. However, after the procedure, she became hypoxemic.

24-hour events include weaning off oxygen support to nasal cannula, maintaining antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and cefepime, and managing hypertension with IV labetalol.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted conditions above. Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 39.3°C (102.8°F), current temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 87 bpm with a range of 78-92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/43 mmHg to 197/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute with a range of 21-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,065 mL and output of 425 mL, resulting in a balance of 640 mL. Respiratory support includes delivery through a nasal cannula and an oxygen saturation"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She was transferred to the ICU due to acute on chronic mental status changes associated with fevers. In the emergency department, a CT scan of her abdomen revealed hydronephrosis. She was given intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone. However, after the placement of a nephrostomy tube, she became hypoxemic.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient's vital signs were monitored, and she received various treatments and medications. She was given oxygen support, antibiotics, and labetalol for hypertension. Her blood pressure fluctuated, sometimes reaching high levels. Her respiratory status improved, and she was weaned off supplemental oxygen. The patient's neurologic status showed improvement, with increased attentiveness and purposeful movements.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels. Her electrolyte levels were within normal range, but she had decreased potassium and calcium levels. Imaging revealed bilateral pleural effusions.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's conditions were assessed as follows:
1. Pyelonephritis with obstructed ureter of unclear etiology.
2. Hypoxemia due to volume overload.
3. Altered mental status likely caused by ongoing infection.
4. Abdominal pain possibly related to stool"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis syndrome. Her initial vital signs included hypotension (SBP 80s) and tachycardia (HR 110s). She required aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Her blood cultures grew E. coli, and she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including cefepime, meropenem, and vancomycin. Her urine culture also grew E. coli, and sensitivities are pending. Her nephrostomy tube was flushed, and she received 24 hours of IV fluids. Her 24-hour urine output was 123 mL, and she received a total of 2,210 mL of IV fluids. Her blood pressures have improved, with a current SBP in the 140s. She is still receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 146/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.28, PCO2 of 28 mmHg, and PO2 of 100 mmHg. Physical examination reveals decreased bowel sounds and no peripheral edema or jugular venous distention. Lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.4 K/uL, hyponatremia with a Na+ level of 133 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 45 mg/dL, and creatinine of 6.6 mg/dL. Her other labs are within normal limits, including liver enzymes, electrolytes, and glucose levels. The patient's constipation has improved with the use of oral PEG solution, and she is currently on IV fluids and TPN for nutrition. She is still experiencing altered mental status, which is not consistent with delirium. Her hypertension is being managed with labetalol and nicardipine. She has a code status of full code and is currently on bed rest in the ICU."

   Final CT abd/pelvis:
   1. Right moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureter with enhancement of
   the wall
   of the right ureter and an apparent distal ureteral mass or stone as
   well as
   urinary bladder wall thickening. Differential considerations are distal
   right
   ureteral neoplasm or, less likely, infection-obstructive calculus.
   Clinical
   correlation and urologic consultation advised. MR urogram may provide
   for
   further imaging assessment, if clinically indicated.
   2. 4.3-cm right lower quadrant cystic structure inseparable from the
   appendix
   and the cecum and adjacent loops of bowel, may represent a GI
   duplication cyst
   or adnexal cyst. Notably the uterus appears surgically absent. Pelvic
   ultrasound suggested on a nonemergent basis if this cystic structure
   has not
   been previously characterized and the right ovary has not been
   previously
   resected.
   3. Large amount of stool in the rectum compatible with fecal impaction.
   4. Cholelithiasis and dilatation of the common bile duct up to 9 mm is
   slightly above upper limit of normal for patient's stated age.
   5. Severe atherosclerotic disease, right renal stent, and possible 3.0
   x 1.4
   cm aneurysm of the right common femoral artery.
   6. Sclerotic appearance with trabecular thickening of the left iliac
   bone,
   most compatible with Paget's disease.

   - continue nephrocaps and sevelamer once taking POs
   .
   # HTN: BP normalized over course of night with labetalol 10mg IV x 3.
   BP likely high in setting of not taking oral hypertensives and also
   being due for HD. Review of outpatient records showed that patient can
   be 180s SBP prior to HD
   - IV labetalol Q6hr with hold parameters
   - switch back PO meds today now that can take POs (carvedilol and
   lisinopril)
   - will have fluid removal at HD today which should help HTN
   .
   # DM: On NPH at home, but currently NPO, planning to advance to PO diet
   slowly
   - advance a slow renal/cardiac diet today
   - cover with HISS, adjust PRN

- The patient's blood pressure is running lower, but it improved this morning.
- The nephrostomy tube was flushed.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) were started due to concerns of infection.
- Urine culture results indicate growth of E. coli, and sensitivities are pending.
- The patient's ability to take fluid off during HD yesterday was unsuccessful.
- The patient's mental status has improved overnight.
- The patient's respiratory support has been weaned down to 2-4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen (NC) overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis: The patient has a history of resistant UTIs and currently has pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but there is a risk of antibiotic resistance or ineffective treatment.
2. Hypoxia: The patient initially required supplemental oxygen but has been weaned down to 2"

   Final CT abd/pelvis:
   1. Right moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureter with enhancement of
   the wall
   of the right ureter and an apparent distal ureteral mass or stone as
   well as
   urinary bladder wall thickening. Differential considerations are distal
   right
   ureteral neoplasm or, less likely, infection-obstructive calculus.
   Clinical
   correlation and urologic consultation advised. MR urogram may provide
   for
   further imaging assessment, if clinically indicated.
   2. 4.3-cm right lower quadrant cystic structure inseparable from the
   appendix
   and the cecum and adjacent loops of bowel, may represent a GI
   duplication cyst
   or adnexal cyst. Notably the uterus appears surgically absent. Pelvic
   ultrasound suggested on a nonemergent basis if this cystic structure
   has not
   been previously characterized and the right ovary has not been
   previously
   resected.
   3. Large amount of stool in the rectum compatible with fecal impaction.
   4. Cholelithiasis and dilatation of the common bile duct up to 9 mm is
   slightly above upper limit of normal for patient's stated age.
   5. Severe atherosclerotic disease, right renal stent, and possible 3.0
   x 1.4
   cm aneurysm of the right common femoral artery.
   6. Sclerotic appearance with trabecular thickening of the left iliac
   bone,
   most compatible with Paget's disease.

   drainage and tube in IR prior to MICU admission
   history of VRE and ESBL/Klebsiella UTI. Abx broadened to
   vanc/meropenem, urine growing E. coli, sensitivies pending.
   - follow-up urine culture sensitivity/resistance data
   - continue vancomycin (day #3) and meropenem (day #2), tailor to UCx
   sensitivies
   - f/u UCx results
   -f/up urology recs, IR recs today (flushing instructions / tube care )
   - f/u final read CT abd/pelvis
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Improving now  and weaned down to 2-4L NC overnight. Likely
   episode prior to admission was in setting of fluid overload and
   positioning as well. AMS is better today.
   - wean down O2 requirement as tolerated
   - renal HD aware
 plan for HD tomorrow (M. W. F)
   - monitor closely for other evidence of infection
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely from new infection. CT head
   without any intracranial abnormality. Patient with continued R hand
   tremors but no evidence of seizures overnight. Older CVA and has some
   mental status baseline impatirments.. Serum and urine tox screen
   negative. TSH, B12 normal.

   # ESRD on HD
   - Renal HD following. Patient normally MWF schedule
 unable to get
   much fluid off at HD yesterday
   - follow up renal recs for next HD date / likely Weds but recent low
   BPs
   - continue nephrocaps and sevelamer once taking POs
   .
   # HTN: BP normalized over course of night with labetalol 10mg IV x 3.
   BP likely high in setting of not taking oral hypertensives and also
   being due for HD. Review of outpatient records showed that patient can
   be 180s SBP prior to HD
   - switch back PO meds today now that can take POs (carvedilol and
   lisinopril)
   - tight hold parameters for recent low BPs

   #Mild abdominal pain: no acute concerns on Abd portion CT done
   overnight. She does have e/o severe constipation so will monitor stools
   today.
   - bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl
 will slow down given
   brisk response with diarrhea now the issue
   - no need for ememas now
   - now loose stools, will send off C.diff

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, resistant urinary tract infections, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis via right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula, diastolic congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease.
- She presented with fever and altered mental status, and was found to have pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis, which was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage.
- The patient's urine culture grew E. coli, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated.
- She also has hypoxia, which improved overnight, and may be related to fluid overload and positioning.
- The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a new infection, as indicated by a negative head CT scan without any intracranial abnormality.
- Her renal function is being monitored closely, as she is on hemodialysis three times a week.
- The patient has difficulty taking fluid off during hemodialysis, with low blood pressures yesterday but improved this morning.
- She has a history of resistant urinary tract infections, and her urine culture sensitivity/resistance data are pending.
- The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with NPH insulin while she is unable to take oral medications.
- Her high blood pressure is being managed with IV labetalol and oral antihyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, resistant urinary tract infections (UTIs), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis via right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula (AVF), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and fever with altered mental status. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia.

The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, which has improved this morning. She has a nephrostomy tube in place for pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis. Urine culture results show growth of E. coli, and sensitivities are pending. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/35 mmHg to 157/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Her blood glucose level is elevated at 160 mg/dL.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 17.4 K/uL and a decreased hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL. Her platelet count is within normal range at 160,000/mm³"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and presenting with altered mental status. She underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement due to a hydroureter. The patient experienced transient hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability during hemodialysis (HoTN). She is currently stable and being treated with antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pyelonephritis: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and now presents with a possible pyelonephritis, potentially caused by an obstructed ureter. The cause of the obstruction needs further investigation. The current treatment plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics and following up with a urologist.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive, which could be due to sepsis. However, she responded well to intravenous fluids (IVF) and is now stable. Cultures have been obtained, and the plan is to continue IVF as needed.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient experienced unclear hypoxemia, which could be related to volume overload or ongoing infection. Her chest X-ray has improved, indicating a decrease in pulmonary edema. This condition will be monitored and followed up.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely experiencing ongoing infection superimposed on dementia. Sedating medications have been withheld, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), presenting with altered mental status and a hydroureter that was subsequently managed with a percutaneous nephrostomy tube. The patient is also diagnosed with pyelonephritis with an obstructed ureter of unclear etiology.

The patient's condition includes hypoxemia, likely secondary to a volume overload due to missed HD, and altered mental status likely due to ongoing infection. There is no evidence of stroke or seizure-like activity. The patient exhibits abdominal pain, which may be related to stool impaction, and there is no evidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO) on abdominal CT.

The patient's hypertension is managed with restarting her home medications, including Coreg and lisinopril. The patient's feeding is advanced with improving mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and is currently diagnosed with pyelonephritis. There is a risk of further infections, particularly if the patient's immune system is compromised.

2. Volume overload: The patient has signs of volume overload, which can lead to respiratory distress and cardiac issues.

3. Renal dysfunction: Given the patient's ESRD and ongoing renal issues, there"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), presenting with altered mental status and a hydroureter, who has undergone a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. She experienced transient hypoxemia and HD-related hypotension (HoTN). The patient has been diagnosed with pyelonephritis with an obstructed ureter of unclear etiology, hypotension possibly due to sepsis, hypoxemia with an unclear etiology, and altered mental status likely due to ongoing infection superimposed on dementia. The patient also has persistent right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which has not improved despite disimpaction, and a normal head CT scan. The patient's ESRD is being managed by renal services for HD, and her nutritional plan will be advanced as her mental status improves.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pyelonephritis: The patient's current diagnosis of pyelonephritis with an obstructed ureter of unclear etiology could potentially lead to further kidney damage, sepsis, or the need for additional interventions such as repeat imaging or surgical intervention.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, possibly due to sepsis, can progress to shock if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.

3. Hypoxemia: The unclear etiology of the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical issues. The patient had difficulty with bedside PICC placement and required assistance from the interventional radiology (IR) department. Additionally, the patient's urine culture revealed an E. coli infection, leading to the initiation of TMP-SMX antibiotic treatment.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including cefepime, meropenem, and vancomycin on March 15th. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature within normal range, heart rate within the normal range, blood pressure showing hypertension, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 295 mL and output of 195 mL through the PO, 100 mL through TF, and 100 mL through IVF. The total output is 295 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -100 mL.

The patient is not receiving respiratory support, and their peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments are not documented. The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of leukocytes, hemoglobin, glucose, lactate, and creatinine, while other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being treated for constipation,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, resistant urinary tract infections in the past, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis via right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease. She presented with fever and altered mental status and was found to have pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis, for which a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed. The patient has shown improvement overnight with hypoxia and relative hypotension. She is currently on a 14-day course of TMP-SMX for the urinary tract infection. The patient's altered mental status is likely back to baseline, possibly with superimposed delirium due to infection. She requires reorientation and out-of-bed activities. She is scheduled for hemodialysis today and will continue nephrocaps and sevelamer once taking oral medications. Her blood pressure remains stable overnight, and she may have her lisinopril added back if hypertensive. Long-acting insulin will be added back when she is better able to take oral medications. She is on aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin for coronary artery disease. Her diastolic congestive heart failure appears to be volume overloaded on examination. Continuing telemetry is recommended. The patient's code status remains full code, and she is being transferred to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, resistant urinary tract infections in the past, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis via right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, who was found to have pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis. She underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement and her hypotension has resolved. The patient's confusion is likely due to superimposed delirium in the setting of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli and evidence of kidney infection with pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis. Continuing the TMP-SMX antibiotic course is appropriate, and follow-up with pending micro and culture results is recommended. Discussion with urology regarding the discontinuation of the nephrostomy tube is also necessary.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion is likely to be back to baseline at this point and may have had superimposed delirium in the setting of infection. Reorientation and out-of-bed activities should be discussed with the family.
3. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD on HD): The patient should continue with regular hemodialysis sessions and maintain nephrocaps and sevelamer once taking oral medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with altered mental status and was found to have a hydroureter. She underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement but experienced transient hypoxemia and HD-related hypotension. The patient is now normotensive on renal replacement therapy and her mental status has stabilized.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient has a urine culture positive for E. coli, which is causing a urinary tract infection (UTI) due to an obstructed ureter with a stricture. Treatment includes Bactrim for 14 days, a nephrostogram as recommended by urology, and clarification of the plan for nephrostomy tube/stricture management.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to an infection superimposed on dementia. A head CT scan shows no abnormalities. It is likely that the patient's mental status is at baseline, but this will be verified with the family. Sedating medications will be held.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a UTI/pyelonephritis. C. difficile negative results will be rechecked with hemodialysis today.
4. RLQ Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, presenting with altered mental status and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The patient has been found to have a hydroureter and underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. She experienced transient hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability during hemodialysis but is now normotensive on regular insulin. The patient's mental status is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient has a urine culture positive for E. coli, indicating a urinary tract infection. The obstructed ureter and stricture may contribute to the pyelonephritis. Treatment includes antibiotic therapy with Bactrim for 14 days, a nephrostogram as recommended by urology, and clarification of the plan for nephrostomy tube/stricture management.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to an infection superimposed on dementia. A head CT scan is normal, and the patient's mental status is expected to be at baseline. Holding sedating medications is advised, and further verification with family is planned.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a UTI/pyelo. C. difficile negative, and the CBC with hemodialysis today will be rechecked.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and presents with altered mental status.
- She has a history of altered mental status, likely due to ongoing infection superimposed on dementia. A head CT was normal.
- The patient is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.
- She has been diagnosed with pyelonephritis, possibly due to an obstructed ureter of unclear etiology.
- The patient experienced transient hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability related to hemodialysis.
- She also presented with hypotension, which is responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).
- The patient has RLQ abdominal pain, which is persistent despite disimpaction. A CT abdomen did not delineate a clear etiology.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and creatinine (Cr) levels.
- Fluid analysis indicates a positive urine culture for E. coli sensitivity to Bactrim, and blood cultures are pending.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate (HR) of 85 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 100/40 mmHg to 178/88 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.
- Physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, as well as soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient has an obstructed ureter, leading to pyelonephritis. This condition can worsen if not appropriately managed with antibiotics and further investigation into the cause of the obstruction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to sepsis or fluid overload. Monitoring fluid intake and output, as well as following up with cultures, is important to manage this complication.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient experienced transient hypoxemia, which could be due to various causes such as volume overload or underlying lung pathology. Further investigation and monitoring are required to determine the cause and prevent future episodes.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to ongoing infection superimposed on dementia. Managing the infection and minimizing sedating medications can help improve her mental status.
5. RLQ Abdominal Pain: The persistent abdominal pain requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. Serial abdominal exams and monitoring of lactate levels may help identify any complications or progression of the condition.
6. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing management, including hemodialysis and close monitoring of renal function.
