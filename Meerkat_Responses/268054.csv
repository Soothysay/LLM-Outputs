   Chief Complaint: 72-F w/ CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 35%), AAA s/p repair,
   PVD s/p multiple bypasses, cryptogenic cirrhosis (likely [**2-27**] NASH) w/
   grade II esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, and gastric
   angioectasias, peptic ulcer disease, and h/o lower GI bleeding [**2-27**] AVMs
   and diverticulosis, who presented to the hospital w/ chest pain and low
   hematocrit. The pt had noted chest pain similar to the chest pain she
   has experienced previously in the setting of a low hematocrit. She had
   also noted through her VNA's biweekly Hct checks that her hematocrit
   had been falling from 30 to 26. She also noted maroon-colored stools in
   the 1-2 days prior to admission, so she came to the ED for evaluation.
   In the ED, VS were stable and she was noted to have Guaiac-positive
   maroon stools. GI was consulted, who recommended IV PPI and
   transfusion. She received 2units PRBCs and 40mg IV Protonix. Her chest
   pain was relieved with NTG, and her ECGs were unchanged from baseline.
   She was admitted to the floor for further care. There she was seen by
   the hepatology team and underwent EGD that showed 3 cords of Grade II
   varices that were banded x4, and underwent sigmoidoscopy that showed
   Grade II internal and external hemorrhoids. She was being monitored on
   the floor on an Octeotride gtt, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], and CTX IV daily. She
   proceeded to have multiple episodes of melanotic stools on the night
   prior to transfer. She was noted to have stable Hcts overnight (35, 36,
   36, 35) and remained HD stable, but was noted in the morning to be
   orthostatic, with a drop in her SBP from 120 to 80. She was transferred
   into the ICU initially for a planned endsocopy by the Hepatology team,
   but it was felt that she should be monitored in the ICU overnight prior
   to any intervention.
   24 Hour Events:
   HCT continued to drop O/N from 36.9 to 31.9. She was transfused 1U pRBC
   PLT dropped below 50 and she was transfused 1U PLT
   CP o/n that did not respond to NTG. Similar to past chest pain in

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, peripheral vascular disease, cryptogenic cirrhosis, esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, gastric angioectasias, peptic ulcer disease, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient presented to the hospital with chest pain and low hematocrit. She reported chest pain similar to previous episodes in the setting of low hematocrit. The patient also noted maroon-colored stools prior to admission. 

In the emergency department, vital signs were stable, and the patient had guaiac-positive maroon stools. The gastrointestinal team recommended intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and transfusion. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 40 mg of IV Protonix. Her chest pain was relieved with nitroglycerin, and her electrocardiograms (ECGs) were unchanged from baseline. She was admitted to the floor for further care.

On the floor, the hepatology team performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed 3 cords of grade II varices which were banded four times. The patient also underwent sigmoidoscopy that showed grade II internal and external hemorrhoids. The patient was being monitored on the floor with octreotide gtt, IV PPI, and CTX IV daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) post-repair, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) post-multiple bypasses, cryptogenic cirrhosis likely due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), grade II esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, gastric angioectasias, peptic ulcer disease, and a history of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding including arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and diverticulosis. She presented with chest pain and anemia, and was found to have melena (dark, tarry stools) indicating possible GI bleeding. She was initially treated with intravenous (IV) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and blood transfusion. She underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed grade II esophageal varices that were banded, and a sigmoidoscopy which revealed grade II internal and external hemorrhoids. She is currently being monitored in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and melena suggests a high risk for variceal bleeding. She"

- The patient experienced a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- Isosorbide dinitrate was added, and lab checks are being done approximately every 6 hours.
- The patient transitioned to clear fluids.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed today to evaluate for valvular lesions. A systolic murmur was heard yesterday, which was initially thought to be new but was noted in a prior discharge summary from 05-03.
- Allergies include Cardizem (oral), Codeine, and Optiray 300 (IV).
- The patient has positive heparin agents and reported cramps in the thigh due to Atorvastatin.
- The last dose of antibiotics was Ceftriaxone on 09-27-2145 at 02:17 PM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) post repair, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) post multiple bypasses, cryptogenic cirrhosis (likely non-alcoholic steatohepatitis - NASH) with grade II esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, and gastric angioectasias, peptic ulcer disease, and history of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She presented to the hospital with chest pain and anemia. She has been seen by hepatology and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showing esophageal varices that were banded four times. She is currently on octreotide gtt, IV pantoprazole (protonix), and CTX IV daily. She continues to have melanic stools and orthostatic hypotension but is otherwise stable hemodynamically and hematocrit-wise. She was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring and potential scope.

   Communication:  Talked to pt
s daughter [**Name (NI) 16**] yesterday.  She is a PACU
   nurse here at [**Hospital1 54**]
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35%, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) status post repair, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post multiple bypasses, cryptogenic cirrhosis (likely non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH), grade II esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, gastric angioectasias, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and diverticulosis.

The patient presented with chest pain, anemia, and melena. Esophageal varices were found and underwent banding four times. She has been receiving octreotide, IV pantoprazole (Protonix), and CTX IV daily, but continues to have melanotic stools and orthostatic hypotension. The hepatology team recommends continuing octreotide, CTX, pantoprazole, and sucralfate, as well as advancing the diet as tolerated, obtaining a hematocrit every 12 hours, placing multiple large-bore peripheral intravenous lines, initiating a type-and-crossmatch, holding home anti-hypertensives except for isosorbide mononitrate,"
151139.0,268054,2145-09-28 04:27:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"24 Hour Events:
   - D/c'ed isosorbide mononitrate, ACE inhib, Lasix, and Carvedilol [**2-27**]
   GI bleed
   - Added isosorbide dinitrate
   - Checking labs approx q6hr.  While in MICU, transfused 1 un pRBC and 1
   un platelets.  HCT responded, however, platelets continue to be low.
   - Had one melanotic stool overnight
   - Hepatology will not scope pt unless HCTs begin to drop as she has had
   multiple recent studies.  Also, advised not to transfuse to a goal of
   >30 as could increase variceal bleeding.  Will need repeat EGD in [**2-28**]
   weeks.
   - Transitioned to clears
   - Will obtain TTE today to eval for valvular lesions.  Yesterday, heard
   a systolic murmur that was thought to be new, however, it was noted in
   a prior discharge summary from [**5-3**]
