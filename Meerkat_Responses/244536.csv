","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status (AMS) and multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.2°F, sinus tachycardia, and hypertension. The respiratory support includes CPAP mask with SpO2 at 91%. The physical examination reveals sedation, clear lungs, no murmurs, and bilateral lower extremity edema.

The laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.6 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 14.3 g/dL, normal platelet count (Plt) of 250,000, and slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 23 mEq/L. The MRI pelvis shows bilateral sacroiliitis consistent with a degenerative process, left iliac chain and obturator internus lymphadenopathy, and ill-defined edema involving the left paraspinal musculature.

The patient's medical history includes altered mental status, multiple CVAs, fevers, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The assessment and plan include continuing ASA and statin for CVAs, stopping heparin gtt due to negative neck MRA, following up with urine"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with altered mental status and multiple cerebrovascular accidents.
- The patient has been experiencing fevers, with a maximum temperature of 101.2°F on 9/18/2192 at 08:00 PM.
- Vital signs include a blood pressure of 147/71mmHg, heart rate of 103bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on CPAP.
- The patient is receiving insulin and various ICU medications.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obstructive sleep apnea.
- The patient's MRI pelvis shows bilateral sacroiliitis, edema in the left paraspinal musculature, and left iliac chain and obturator internus lymphadenopathy.
- The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia, and other abnormalities.
- The patient's disposition is pending neuro consultation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and positive urine analysis suggest a possible urinary tract infection or another source of infection. Cultures have been ordered to identify the causative organism.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, which may indicate the need for adjustments in medication or fluid administration to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is below the desired"

   MRI Pelvis:
   1) Bilateral sacroiliitis, consisting primarily of sclerosis with faint
   edema
   and enhancement about the superior aspect and small osteophytes. No
   erosions

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with altered mental status and a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). He has been admitted to the ICU with the following concerns:

1. Fever: The patient developed a fever of 101.2°F on 09/18/2192. Blood cultures were drawn, and antibiotics were started. The source of infection is still unknown.

2. Sacroiliitis and pelvic lymphadenopathy: An MRI of the pelvis revealed bilateral sacroiliitis, which is inflammation of the sacroiliac joints. This finding, along with the presence of pelvic lymphadenopathy, suggests a possible inflammatory condition such as reactive arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is being closely monitored and managed.

4. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient is receiving nighttime CPAP therapy for OSA.

5. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient's diabetes is being managed with NPH insulin and ISS.

6. Care in the ICU:
   - The patient is receiving nutrition through a Dobhoff tube.
   - His glycemic control is maintained with home NPH and ISS.
   - He has multiple IV lines in place, including a central line.
   - Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being implemented.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute mental status changes (AMS), multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), hypertension, osteoarthritis, diabetes mellitus, and obstructive sleep apnea. He presents with fever, increasing rash on his arms and legs from the back, and is currently sedated and arousable transiently. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 120/71 to 165/94 mmHg, heart rate between 94-111 bpm, respiratory rate of 17-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on high-flow nasal cannula.

Flowsheet data shows fluid balance with a total intake of 2061 mL and output of 2045 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 16 mL. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. His labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels.

Assessment and plan:
1. Multiple CVAs: The patient has bilateral thalamic infarcts and right pontine infarct, which are consistent with small vessel disease. Heparin infusion has been stopped, and the patient will continue with aspirin and statin therapy.
2. Fevers: An MRI of the pelvis confirms findings of sacroiliitis and pelvic inflammatory disease, which seems more consistent with a degenerative process. The patient continues to spike fevers and will have follow-up urine cultures and sensitivities. CTX will be continued for now and broadened based on culture and sensitivity results.
3. HTN: The patient's blood pressure will be titrated with captopril.
4. OSA: The patient will continue with nighttime CPAP therapy.
5. DM: The patient will continue with NPH/ISS and will titrate NPH.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and increased rash may indicate an underlying infection. The positive blood cultures and pending urine cultures also suggest the possibility of a bloodstream infection or urinary tract infection.
2. Thromboembolic events: Given the patient's history of multiple CVAs and current negative neck MRA, there is a risk of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
3. Worsening renal function: The decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, along with increased creatinine, may indicate worsening renal function.
4. Poor glycemic control: The elevated blood glucose levels may indicate poor glycemic control in the patient with diabetes mellitus.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note and potential medical complications. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management of the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), presenting with altered mental status (AMS), fevers, and a recent change in medication. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, tachycardia with a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient is intubated and receiving respiratory support through high-flow nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 95%. The physical examination reveals pitting edema in both lower extremities, as well as sedation and limited response to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.7 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels, and hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level of 234 mg/dL. The blood cultures from 08/01-09/19 are positive for NGTD, while the urine culture from 09/18 is pending, and the CSF culture from 09/14 shows no growth. The MRI pelvis confirms findings of sacroiliitis and pelvic lateral asymmetry, suggesting a degenerative process rather than an infectious cause for the fever. The differential diagnosis for the fevers includes aspiration pneumonia versus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), central fever, and drug fever.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing aspir"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), presenting with altered mental status (AMS) and respiratory distress.
- He has been diagnosed with bilateral thalamic infarcts and right pontine infarct, which may be the cause of his somnolence.
- The patient has been experiencing fevers, and an MRI of the pelvis confirmed findings of sacroiliitis and pelvic osteoarthritis, likely a degenerative process.
- He has been treated with various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, but continues to spike fevers. Possible causes include aspiration pneumonia (AP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), central fever, or drug fever.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and diabetes mellitus (DM).
- In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube, insulin for glycemic control, and has a PICC line for medication administration.
- Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and fevers could indicate the development of pneumonia. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia (AP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Deep vein thrombosis ("

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with mental status changes and respiratory distress. He has a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), which include bilateral thalamic infarcts and right pontine infarct. This could be the reason for his somnolence.

The patient is currently experiencing fevers, and imaging confirms findings of sacroiliitis and pelvic lymphadenopathy, which is more consistent with a degenerative process. Possible differentials for his fevers include aspiration pneumonia (PNA) versus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), central fever, or drug fever.

The patient also has a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and diabetes mellitus. He is being treated with various medications, including insulin, antihypertensives, and antidiabetics.

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for developing further respiratory issues due to his respiratory distress and the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. There is also a risk of infection due to the presence of a central line and the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's history of multiple CVAs puts him at risk for neurological complications. Additionally, his diabetes mellitus increases the risk of poor glycemic control.

Overall, the patient's current medical complications include respiratory distress, potential infection (aspiration pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia), and neurological impairment due to"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3971**] is a 55M who presents with AMS found to have multiple CVAs
   1) CVA: Bilateral thalamic infarcts and R pontine infarct.  Likely
   reason for his somnolence
   -Continue ASA, statin
   - f/u Neuro recs
   2) Fevers: MRI pelvis confirms findings of sacroiliitis and pelvic LAD,
   per report seems more consistent with a degenerative process.
   Continues to spike fevers through CTX/levofloxacin.  DDX include
   aspiration PNA vs. VAP with recent intubation, UTI, central fevers,
   drug fevers
   -F/u urine cultures and sensitivities, CXR today, sputum culture
   -continue levoflox for now, will broaden based on C&S and CXR, can
   consider unasyn vs. clinda if concern for aspiration PNA vs.
   pseudomonas coverage with cipro or zosyn if concerned for a VAP
   3) HTN:
   -Continue to titrate Captopril
   4) OSA:
   -Continue auto-CPAP
   5)DM: continue NPH/ ISS, will titrate NPH

   2) Fevers: MRI pelvis confirms findings of sacroiliitis and pelvic LAD,
   per report seems more consistent with a degenerative process.
   Continues to spike fevers through CTX/levofloxacin.  DDX include
   aspiration PNA vs. VAP with recent intubation, UTI, central fevers,
   drug fevers
   -F/u urine cultures and sensitivities, CXR today, sputum culture
   -continue levoflox for now, will broaden based on C&S and CXR, can
   consider unasyn vs. clinda if concern for aspiration PNA vs.
   pseudomonas coverage with cipro or zosyn if concerned for a VAP
   3) HTN:
   -Continue to titrate Captopril

","Summary:
- Patient is a 55-year-old male with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs).
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications, including insulin for elevated blood sugars, Vancomycin and Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia coverage, and Captopril for hypertension.
- The patient has a fever of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit and is experiencing respiratory distress with a low oxygen saturation level of 93%.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and lactic acid levels. The imaging shows patchy bibasilar opacities with low lung volumes, likely representing atelectasis with small effusions.
- The patient's medical history includes aspiration pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obstructive sleep apnea.
- The patient's current plan includes continuing ASA and statin for CVAs, monitoring for fevers, adjusting medication dosages, and providing respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of OSA and recent intubation increase the risk of aspiration. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic coverage are necessary.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory distress and fever could indicate VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory parameters, sputum cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are needed.
3. Hypotension:"

   1) CVA: Bilateral thalamic infarcts and R pontine infarct.  Likely
   reason for his somnolence and persistent R sided weakness.
   -Continue ASA, statin
   - f/u Neuro recs
   2) Fevers/SOB: Patient noted to have new infiltrate on cxray. Started
   on Vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP. He spiked overnight again but fever
   curve improving
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Continued Vanc/Zosyn
   -- Keep sacro-iliitis in differential diagnosis
   -- Would also consider possible reaction to drugs given question of
   rash to ceftriaxone
   3) HTN: Continue to titrate Captopril
   4) OSA: Continue auto-CPAP
   5)DM: Difficult to control, with some improvement overnight

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid syndrome (AMS) and multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), presenting with difficulty controlling diabetes mellitus (DM), fevers, shortness of breath (SOB), hypertension (HTN), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers and has been started on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). There is a concern for possible drug reaction or a severe infection such as sepsis or bacteremia, given the subtherapeutic vancomycin level.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient requires non-invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization and underlying comorbidities. Prophylactic measures are in place, including subcutaneous heparin.
4. Sacroiliitis: The patient's fevers and symptoms may suggest sacroiliitis as a possible diagnosis. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this.
5. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's sinus tachycardia and fever raise concern for the possibility of a PE. Further evaluation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been experiencing several events and conditions. 

The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. However, there have been some significant events that occurred during the 24-hour period covered by the note.

On [**2192-9-21**] at 10:59 AM, a blood culture was taken via peripheral stick and PICC line. This suggests that the medical team may be investigating an infection or bloodstream infection.

At [**2192-9-21**] 01:09 PM, non-invasive ventilation was stopped, and then restarted at [**2192-9-21**] 07:00 PM. This indicates that the patient's respiratory status required intervention, possibly due to difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation or ventilation.

A urine culture was also ordered at [**2192-9-21**] 10:00 PM, which further supports the suspicion of an infection.

The patient has a fever of 101.2°F (measured at [**2192-9-21**] 08:00 PM) and has been on an insulin drip, with the dosage improved to 7 units per hour and a glucose level of 120.

The patient does not have any known drug allergies. Antibiotics were administered previously, including Levofloxacin on [**2192-9-19**] 02:42 PM, Vancomycin on [**2192-9-21**] 08:00 PM, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2192-9-22**] 12:00 AM.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including insulin and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications are also mentioned but specific details are not provided.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings.

The patient's vital signs show an increased heart rate (102 bpm) within the normal range (98-123 bpm), slightly elevated blood pressure (134/73 mmHg), respiratory rate (18 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has received a total of 4,313 mL of fluids since midnight, with 1,450 mL of fluids being given as blood products. The patient's urine output is 1,450 mL since midnight.

The patient is on non-invasive ventilation using a CPAP mask, with an SpO2 of 91% and ABG results showing pH 7.48, PaCO2 39 mmHg, and HCO3- 75 mmol/L. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 125.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the fact that peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments, and other vital signs were not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.6 K/uL, slightly low platelet count (Plt) of 236 K/uL, and normal hemoglobin (Hct) levels. Other lab results, including creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests, are within normal ranges.

Radiology images are mentioned but not included in the provided information.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines (including a PICC line), prophylaxis (such as for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers), and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include infections (as indicated by the blood and urine cultures), respiratory distress or failure (due to the need for non-invasive ventilation), glycemic control issues (given the insulin drip), and possible thromboembolic events (considering the use of heparin and the need for a PICC line)."

   #) Fevers/SOB: Started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP. He spiked
   overnight again, vanc level sub therapeutic
   -- Surveillance cultures
   -- Continued Vanc/Zosyn, adjust dose of Vanc to 1000mg Q8H
   -- Keep sacro-iliitis in differential diagnosis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of AMS (acute myocardial infarction), multiple CVAs (cerebrovascular accidents), DM (diabetes mellitus), hypertension, and OSA (obstructive sleep apnea). The patient presents with episodes of ectopy on telemetry, bilateral reproducible chest pain, and elevated CK levels. He also has a fever and is being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been experiencing difficulty in weaning off the insulin drip and has had several episodes of tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's symptoms of chest pain and elevated CK levels suggest the possibility of another myocardial infarction.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate a potential infection. Considering his current treatment for HAP and the presence of a central line, there is a risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection.
3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's difficult-to-control DM may lead to complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, especially with the ongoing insulin therapy.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's history of CVAs and sinus tachycardia raise concerns for possible thromboembolic events like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Sacroiliitis: The mention of sacroiliitis as a possible diagnosis warrants further evaluation, considering the patient's symptoms and potential drug reactions.
6. Pressure Ulcers: Due to the patient's prolonged bedridden state, there is a risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's current need for mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), currently admitted for altered mental status (AMS) and persistent fevers, along with hypoglycemia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation, and an EKG was performed on 09/23/2192. The patient was taken off non-invasive ventilation on 09/23/2192 at 08:00 AM and restarted on 09/24/2192 at 12:00 AM. The patient continues to spike fevers and has a growing gram-positive cocci (GPC) infection in culture from the percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line. Surveillance cultures have been sent, and insulin gtt has been restarted for increased blood sugars in the range of 400s. The patient received a 250cc bolus for poor urine output and was given metoprolol 5mg IV for tachycardia and hypertension. No new recommendations were provided by the consultant. The rate of tube feeds has been cut down due to hyperglycemia, and vancomycin levels remain subtherapeutic; however, additional doses are not necessary according to the pharmacy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/Bacteremia: The patient's persistent fevers and growing GPC infection suggest a possible ongoing bacteremia. The current regimen of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobact"

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient was previously on non-invasive ventilation but was temporarily taken off due to equipment issues. He has been started on non-invasive ventilation again and continues to spike fevers to 102 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The patient has a growing growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC) in culture from the peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. Surveillance cultures have been sent to identify any other potential sources of infection. 

Insulin has been restarted for increased blood sugars, which are in the 400s. The patient received a 250cc bolus for poor urine output. 

Metoprolol 5mg IV was given for tachycardia and hypertension. A consultation with a specialist was made, but no new recommendations were provided. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. 

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 39.1 degrees Celsius (102.3 degrees Fahrenheit), a current temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 119 beats per minute (normal range 102-125 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 125/69 mmHg to 160/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (normal range 18-31 bpm), and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP mask.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), presenting with altered mental status and persistent fevers. He has been on non-invasive ventilation and is currently experiencing hypoglycemia. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.3°F, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 125/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP mask. 

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.7 K/uL, elevated glucose levels ranging from 250-305 mg/dL, and slightly low platelet count of 266 K/uL. The creatinine level is within normal range at 0.7 mg/dL, and the troponin T level is negative at 0.02 ng/mL. 

Microbiology cultures show growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters from the PICC line, while urine culture is pending. The patient has been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) but has subtherapeutic vancomycin levels. 

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), presenting with altered mental status, persistent fevers, and hypoglycemia. He was started on non-invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing fevers, which have not resolved despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. His blood sugar levels have been elevated, and he required insulin therapy. The patient also has poor urine output, for which he received a 250cc bolus. His blood pressure and heart rate have been elevated, and he was given metoprolol to manage these symptoms. The patient has been on tube feeds, but due to hyperglycemia, the rate was reduced.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures revealed growth of gram-positive cocci in clusters from the PICC line, but no other significant findings. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low magnesium level. Imaging and other microbiology tests are pending.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Fevers/bacteremia: The patient continues to have fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Differential diagnoses include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), prostatitis, sacroiliitis, occult malignancy, central fever, and drug fever. Vancomycin and piperacillin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), currently admitted to the ICU with acute mental status changes (AMS), persistent fevers, and hypoglycemia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation and is now on CPAP support. He has been receiving antibiotics for suspected bacteremia, and his fevers have been defervescing. The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) has significantly improved with current medication and volume of tube feeds. The patient's nutrition is being aggressively managed, and he is starting to take some oral intake. The patient's stroke is being managed conservatively, and he will require intensive rehabilitation. The patient's hypertension (HTN) is being managed with titration of captopril and addition of a low-dose beta blocker due to ectopy and tachycardia. The patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is being managed with CPAP during sleep. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/bacteremia: The patient's persistent fevers indicate an ongoing infection. The most likely cause is hospital-acquired pneumonia. The current treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam is appropriate, but the patient's response should be closely monitored. 
2. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's DM has improved with the current regimen and volume of tube feeds. However, controlling blood glucose levels is essential to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for altered mental status (AMS) and persistent fevers. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation and received antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/59 mmHg to 139/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP, and sinus rhythm on telemetry.

The patient's physical examination revealed distant heart sounds, clear lungs anteriorly, an obese abdomen with negative bowel sounds, bilateral lower extremity edema with 1+ pulses, and weak movement of fingers on the right side, although able to move fingers on the left side.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's renal function is within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Fevers/bacteremia: The patient's fever has been improving after reaching therapeutic levels of vancomycin. A positive culture from the peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line indicates growth of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3971**] is a 55M who presents with AMS found to have multiple CVAs,
   now admitted with persistent fevers and hypoglycemia
    1) Fevers/bacteremia:  Curve defervessing after reaching therapeutic
   levels of vancomycin. Postive culture from PICC line with coag negative
   staph. DDX includes VAP/HAP, prostatitis, sacroiliits, occult
   malignancy, central fever, drug fever, with the most likely cause being
   a hospital acquired pneumonia.
   -- Vanc/zosyn started on [**9-21**], however vancomycin had been
   subtherapeutic. Therapeutic as of [**9-25**], however several doses held.
   Transitioned today to 1g q12. Will check vano trough again after third
   dose at this level.
   -- F/u pending cultures, including PICC line, if positive will need to
   D/C PICC
   -- Foley catheter replaced [**9-22**]
   2) DM: Glycemic control has significantly improved. Nutrition aggress
   with plan as patient is starting to take some PO.
   --  NPH transitioned to 100 units Lantus [**Hospital1 **]
   --  Have started metformin 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Nutrition recommends against bolus tube feeds given difficulty in
   controlling blood glucose
   3) Stroke: Continue conservative management, aspirin and statin for
   secondary prevention
   -- Patient will require intensive rehabilitation
   4) HTN: Yesterday transitioned captopril to lisinopril. Also uptitrated
   pt's beta blocker given ectopy and tachycardia. However, given
   transient hypotension yesterday afternoon, stopped lisinopril and
   reduced and metoprolol to 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   5) HypoTN: Pt dropped SBPs to high 70s yesterday in setting of
   receiving Lasix, lisinopril and BB. Required 500cc saline bolus to
   improve. Have reduced doses of antihypertensives as believe pt still
   requires significant diuresis.
   6) OSA: Continue CPAP during sleep

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), admitted with acute mental status changes and persistent fevers. He has been treated with antibiotics for suspected bacteremia, and his fever has defervesced after reaching therapeutic levels of vancomycin. A positive culture from the PICC line indicates coag-negative staph infection. Other possible causes for the fever include hospital-acquired pneumonia, prostatitis, sacroiliitis, occult malignancy, central fever, or drug fever. 

The patient's glycemic control has improved, and he is starting to take oral intake. His nutrition plan includes aggressive nutrition support, but tube feeds may not be recommended due to difficulty in controlling blood glucose levels. The patient is being managed conservatively for his strokes, and he is on aspirin and statin for secondary prevention. His hypertension is being managed with lisinopril and a beta-blocker, but the doses have been reduced due to transient hypotension. The patient also has hypoTension, which requires careful management of his antihypertensive medications. He continues to require CPAP during sleep due to obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fevers/bacteremia: The patient's fever has improved after reaching therapeutic levels of vancomycin, but there is a risk of ongoing infection from the coag-negative staph infection in the PICC line. Further evaluation is needed"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3971**] is a 55M who presents with AMS found to have multiple CVAs,
   now with persistent fevers and hypoglycemia
    1) Fevers/bacteremia:  Curve defervessing after reaching therapeutic
   levels of vancomycin. Postive culture from PICC line with coag negative
   staph. DDX includes VAP/HAP, prostatitis, sacroiliits, occult
   malignancy, central fever, drug fever, with the most likely cause being
   a hospital acquired pneumonia.
   -- Vanc/zosyn started on [**9-21**], however vancomycin had been
   subtherapeutic. Therapeutic now. Repeat vanc level pending for this
   morning.
   -- Continue Vanc to 1.25gm Q8H x 8 days from therapeutic (last day
   [**2192-10-1**]).
   -- F/u pending cultures, including PICC line, if positive will need to
   D/C PICC
   -- Foley catheter replaced [**9-22**]
   2) DM: Significanly improved with current regimen and
 volume of tube
   feeds. Nutrition aggress with plan as patient is starting to take some
   PO.
   --  Continue 100units of NPH [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Nutrition recommends against bolus tube feeds given difficulty in
   controlling blood glucose
   -- [**Last Name (un) 276**] following, no changes for now
   -- ISS has been off for 24hrs
   3) Stroke: Continue conservative management, aspirin and statin for
   secondary prevention
   -- Patient will require intensive rehabilitation
   4) HTN: Yesterday transitioned captopril to lisinopril. Also uptitrated
   pt's beta blocker given ectopy and tachycardia. However, given
   transient hypotension yesterday afternoon, have reduced lisinopril to
   20 mg daily and metoprolol to 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   5) HypoTN: Pt dropped SBPs to high 70s yesterday in setting of
   receiving Lasix, lisinopril and BB. Required 500cc saline bolus to
   improve. Have reduced doses of antihypertensives as believe pt still
   requires significant diuresis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), presenting with altered mental status (AMS), persistent fevers, and hypoglycemia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation and is currently receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/58 mmHg to 142/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on CPAP. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,683 mL and output of 2,710 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 973 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and slightly low platelet count. The patient has positive cultures for coag-negative staph from the PICC line, and the most likely cause of the fevers is hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/bacteremia: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which have defervesced after reaching therapeutic levels of vancomycin. A positive culture from the PICC line indicates a possible infection. The differential diagnosis includes ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), prostatitis, sacro"

Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
- He presented with altered mental status (AMS) and persistent fevers, as well as hypoglycemia.
- The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by coag-negative staphylococcus from the PICC line.
- He is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for infection control.
- The patient also has diabetes mellitus (DM) and is being managed with insulin therapy (NPH and Lantus) and metformin.
- He has hypertension (HTN) and is on lisinopril and metoprolol, but experienced transient hypotension, so the doses were reduced.
- The patient also has hypoTension (HypoTN) due to the combination of Lasix, lisinopril, and beta-blocker therapy.
- He has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is being managed with CPAP during sleep.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's persistent fevers and positive culture from the PICC line suggest a possible HAP. This can be confirmed by further evaluation,"

   Assessment and Plan
 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3971**] is a 55M who presents with AMS found to have multiple CVAs,
   now admitted with persistent fevers and hypoglycemia
    1) Fevers/bacteremia:  Curve defervessing after reaching therapeutic
   levels of vancomycin. Postive culture from PICC line with coag negative
   staph. DDX includes VAP/HAP, prostatitis, sacroiliits, occult
   malignancy, central fever, drug fever, with the most likely cause being
   a hospital acquired pneumonia.
   -- Vanc/zosyn started on [**9-21**], however vancomycin had been
   subtherapeutic. Therapeutic as of [**9-25**], however several doses held.
   Transitioned today to 1g q12. Will check vano trough again after third
   dose at this level. Today is considered [**6-21**] day course for line
   infection.
   -- Zosyn for presumed VAP, currently day [**8-21**] day course.
   -- F/u pending cultures, no new data today. Blood cx positive for CNS
   in one bottle, will treat as above with 8 day course for line
   infection.
   -- Foley catheter replaced [**9-22**], again with + UA from [**9-25**] with
   recurrent candiduria. In setting of low grade fevers while on ATC
   Tylenol with positive UA will consider symptomatic bactiuria.  Change
   foley again today and initiate 14 course of diflucan, loading dose
   today.
   2) DM: Glycemic control has significantly improved. Nutrition aggress
   with plan as patient is starting to take some PO.
   --  NPH transitioned to 100 units Lantus [**Hospital1 **]
   --  Have started metformin 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Nutrition recommends against bolus tube feeds given difficulty in
   controlling blood glucose
   -- Increased HISS per Josin recs
   -- Follow up [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs today
   3) Stroke: Continue conservative management, aspirin and statin for
   secondary prevention
   -- Patient will require intensive rehabilitation
   4) Blood pressure, had been increasing anti-hypertensive regimen with
   captopril and BB, had episode of hypotension in setting of getting
   lasix and BP meds on [**9-25**].  BP meds decreased but still had single
   episode of hypotension yesterday in setting of getting captopril and
   being upright, as is slightly more tachycardic that before (although HR
   has been in 90-100s throughout hospital course), have d/c
d captopril
   and lasix due to concerns re orthostasis, possibility that patient may
   be intravascularly dry despite being fluid overloaded on exam and 10+
   liters positive this stay.
   -Continue BB
   -Hold lasix and ACEI
   -OOB as much as possible to allow pt to mobilize fluid and begin to
   auto-diurese
   5)OSA: Continue CPAP during sleep

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with altered mental status and was found to have multiple cerebrovascular accidents. The patient's course has been complicated by difficult-to-control blood sugar levels and fevers. He required non-invasive ventilation, which was started on September 26th at 8:10 pm and stopped on September 26th at 9:04 am. The insulin regimen was increased as recommended by Dr. [First Name8 (NamePattern2)] [Last Name (un) 276]. The patient experienced a transient episode of hypotension in the 80s several hours after receiving a dose of captopril while upright. As a result, captopril was stopped, and lasix was also stopped due to relative tachycardia and concern for orthostasis, as well as the possibility that the patient may be intravascularly dry.

Allergies:
The patient has no known drug allergies.

Medications:
The patient received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on September 27th at 12:06 am. He is also receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) as of September 27th at 12:07 am.

Infusions:
Other ICU medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

   Assessment and Plan
 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3971**] is a 55M who presents with AMS found to have multiple CVAs,
   now admitted with persistent fevers and hypoglycemia
    1) Fevers/bacteremia:  Curve defervessing after reaching therapeutic
   levels of vancomycin. Postive culture from PICC line with coag negative
   staph. DDX includes VAP/HAP, prostatitis, sacroiliits, occult
   malignancy, central fever, drug fever, with the most likely cause being
   a hospital acquired pneumonia.
   -- Vanc/zosyn started on [**9-21**], however vancomycin had been
   subtherapeutic. Therapeutic as of [**9-25**], however several doses held.
   Transitioned today to 1g q12. Will check vano trough again after third
   dose at this level.
   -- F/u pending cultures, including PICC line, if positive will need to
   D/C PICC
   -- Foley catheter replaced [**9-22**]
   2) DM: Glycemic control has significantly improved. Nutrition aggress
   with plan as patient is starting to take some PO.
   --  NPH transitioned to 100 units Lantus [**Hospital1 **]
   --  Have started metformin 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Nutrition recommends against bolus tube feeds given difficulty in
   controlling blood glucose
   3) Stroke: Continue conservative management, aspirin and statin for
   secondary prevention
   -- Patient will require intensive rehabilitation
   4) HTN: Yesterday transitioned captopril to lisinopril. Also uptitrated
   pt's beta blocker given ectopy and tachycardia. However, given
   transient hypotension yesterday afternoon, stopped lisinopril and
   reduced and metoprolol to 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   5) HypoTN: Pt dropped SBPs to high 70s yesterday in setting of
   receiving Lasix, lisinopril and BB. Required 500cc saline bolus to
   improve. Have reduced doses of antihypertensives as believe pt still
   requires significant diuresis.
   6) OSA: Continue CPAP during sleep

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was found to have multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). He is currently admitted with persistent fevers and hypoglycemia. The patient has been receiving non-invasive ventilation and has had transient episodes of hypotension. He has been prescribed multiple medications including antihypertensives, diuretics, and antibiotics for suspected bacteremia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires ongoing monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/bacteremia: The patient's fevers have been improving after reaching therapeutic levels of vancomycin. However, a positive culture from the PICC line indicates a coag-negative staph infection. This could potentially lead to further complications such as sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently low, indicating ongoing hypoglycemia. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent potential complications like altered mental status, seizures, or even coma.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, particularly when receiving Lasix, lisinopril, and beta-blockers. This requires careful monitoring and adjustment of medications to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

4. Chronic Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):"
