","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with shortness of breath and fever. They were admitted to the ICU and required BiPAP support initially but did not require it overnight. Their respiratory status was stable on 6 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and they were successfully weaned to 3 liters of oxygen. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, Augmentin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and pruritus. They were receiving various medications including furosemide, pantoprazole, nephrocaps, atrovent, levofloxacin, vancomycin, colace, ursodiol, prednisone, bacrim, sirolimus, nifedipine, losartan, lamictal, and hydroxyzine.

Vital signs were within normal range with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/77 to 165/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm was sinus rhythm.

The patient's review of systems was unchanged from admission except for a high-grade fever in the ER. They had crackles in bilateral symmetric chest upon physical examination. Their extremities showed no edema, and their neurologic examination was normal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and epilepsy. She was admitted with shortness of breath and hypoxia, concerning for pneumonia (PNA). The patient now presents with melena, likely secondary to known multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed five months ago. The patient has been having a chronic cough for several weeks and recent echocardiogram findings suggest decreased right ventricular (RV) function, which may be due to worsening lung disease at baseline and now likely has a right lower lobe (RLL) PNA. The patient has already had a z-pack without improvement. She is also experiencing fluid overload due to recent short hemodialysis (HD) sessions, which is likely an important contribution to her shortness of breath tonight.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Melena: Likely secondary to known multiple AVMs from EGD in 5/ [**2185**]. Given 1 pRBC overnight. Tachycardia improved. Hct 37-34-36.

   - NPO for likely EGD, may need intubation
   - active T&S
   - IV ppi gtt
   - Decrease steroids to 15mg prednisone QD
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia/PNA: has been having a chronic cough for several
   weeks. Recent echo is concerning for some decreased RV function which
   may be due to worsening lung disease at baseline and now pt likely has
   a RLL PNA. She has already had a zpak without improvement. Now also
   having fluid overload due to recent short HD sessions, which is likely
   an important contribution to her SOB tonight.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypoxia, now presenting with melena. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

1. Melena: The patient is experiencing melena, which is likely secondary to known multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from a previous esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient has already received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) overnight, and her heart rate has improved. Hematocrit (Hct) levels are being monitored every 6 hours, and further transfusion of pRBC is recommended for active bleeding or signs of instability.

2. Dyspnea/Hypoxia/Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has been experiencing chronic cough for several weeks. Recent echocardiogram findings suggest decreased right ventricular (RV) function, which may be due to worsening lung disease at baseline and now the patient likely has right lower lobe pneumonia. She has already been treated with azithromycin (Z-Pak) without improvement. The patient also has fluid overload due to recent short hemodialysis (HD) sessions, which is likely contributing to her SOB tonight.

- Oxygen therapy should be provided to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hypertension. She was admitted with shortness of breath and hypoxia, and was concerned for pneumonia (PNA). The patient now presents with melena, likely secondary to known arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in 2015.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.7°F, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/87 mmHg to 100/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's physical examination revealed crackles at the bases of the lungs, dullness at the right base to percussion, and no rashes visible.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 35.6 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 133 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has a chest X-ray showing no significant change from the previous study, with persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and catheters in place. There is no evidence of acute"

The patient developed cramps in the lower extremities during HD and also experienced gross melena, which indicates upper GI bleeding. An urgent femoral access was placed, and the patient underwent a gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. The patient received a blood transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) to increase their hematocrit (hct) to 33%.

The patient has a fever of 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit and is experiencing persistent tachycardia. An internal jugular venous catheter (SVC) was consulted for evaluation of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.

The patient's allergies include heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, augmentin (Amox Tr/Potassium Clavulanate), lisinopril, metoprolol, and pruritus. The last dose of antibiotics given was vancomycin at 09:24 PM on 10/13/2185.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), lorazepam (Ativan), atrovent, levofloxacin, vancomycin, prednisone, bactrim, sevelamer, nifedipine, lamictal, and hydroxyzine.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The flow sheet data shows that the patient's maximum temperature was 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit, with the current temperature being 99 degrees Fahrenheit. The heart rate is within the range of 98-129 beats per minute, and the blood pressure varies between 100/63 and 154/94 mmHg. The respiratory rate is between 19-37 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 54 kg at admission to 59.4 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,797 mL and total output of 1,110 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,687 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of 7.49/37/77/26/4.

The physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. There are no abnormalities noted in the eyes, head, ears, nose, or throat. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. The respiratory/chest examination reveals crackles at the bases, which are decreased from yesterday. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there is no edema"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, admitted with shortness of breath and hypoxia. She is currently experiencing several medical complications:

1. Renal failure (ESRD): The patient has a history of ESRD and is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. She has been having decreased HD sessions recently due to cramps.

2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing a persistent fever, and the cause has not yet been determined.

3. Gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed): The patient has melena, which is likely secondary to known multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). She has received a blood transfusion for active bleeding and signs of instability.

4. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a chronic cough for several weeks and an echo that is concerning for some decreased right ventricular (RV) function. She may have worsening lung disease at baseline and now has a right lower lobe pneumonia. She has already had a z-pack without improvement.

5. Sepsis: The patient has had fever and elevated lactate levels, suggesting possible sepsis. She has a likely PNA on chest x-ray in the right lower lobe. Her blood cultures have been negative, doub"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and epilepsy. She was admitted with shortness of breath and hypoxia, concerning for pneumonia. She has multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and is currently experiencing melena, which may be secondary to the AVMs. She also has decreased right ventricular function, likely due to worsening lung disease at baseline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis (HD). Decreased HD sessions can lead to fluid overload and worsening renal function.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing melena, indicating possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be related to her AVMs or other underlying conditions.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a chronic cough and recent imaging suggests a right lower lobe pneumonia. This could be due to her weakened lung function and may require antibiotic treatment.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fever without a known source. It is important to investigate the cause of this fever to prevent any potential infections or complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications such as stroke or heart disease.
6. Epilepsy: The patient has a history of epilepsy and is currently on home ke"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of sarcoidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and pulmonary hypertension. She is currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has been treated with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is showing improvement in dyspnea since admission. She is also receiving hemodialysis (HD) and being treated for ESRD. GIB is being managed by the GI team, with plans to space out critical medications and monitor for signs of ongoing bleeding. The patient is on prednisone for sarcoidosis, and her dose will be continued at a slightly lower level. She has hypertension, which is being managed with losartan, and there are plans to add nifedipine later today. The patient also has vascular stenosis, for which angioplasty is planned in the future.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of pneumonia: Despite treatment with antibiotics, the patient's pneumonia could worsen, leading to respiratory failure or sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB needs to be closely monitored for any signs of ongoing bleeding or rebleeding.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are on the lower side, indicating a potential risk of hypotension, which could lead to organ dysfunction or shock.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and epilepsy. She was admitted with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and fever, which were concerning for pneumonia (PNA). The patient also presented with melena, likely secondary to known multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in 2015. Her tachycardia improved, and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is now stable at 34-39%.

The patient has chronic cough, recent echocardiogram findings suggesting decreased right ventricular function, and worsening lung disease. She has a right lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient was treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin for an 8-day course, but she has an allergy to penicillin. She is also experiencing fluid overload due to recent short hemodialysis (HD) sessions.

The patient's blood cultures were negative, and there is no evidence of line infection. Her blood pressure has been stable to elevated. She has a history of sepsis, but currently, her condition is improving.

The patient has chronic inferior vena cava (IJ) clots, which will be evaluated with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and treated with angioplasty as an outpatient. She is on maintenance HD at"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of thrombocytopenia, heparin allergy, and multiple drug allergies. The patient's chief complaint is multi-lumen central venous catheter (CVC) removal due to groin line infection. The patient's HCT has been stable, and it is likely that they can be discharged from the MICU in the morning. Vancomycin was held due to elevated levels, and the patient's diet was advanced to mechanical soft. Nifedipine was restarted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Groin line infection leading to the removal of the multi-lumen CVC.
2. Thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Heparin allergy, which can lead to anaphylactic reactions if exposed to heparin.
4. Drug allergies to augmentin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and possibly other medications.
5. Elevated vancomycin levels, which can cause toxicity if not monitored and adjusted properly.
6. Potential risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
7. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers due to immobility and critical illness.
8. Impaired glycemic control, as indicated by abnormal glucose levels.
9. Abnormal liver function tests, including elevated ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase.
10. Elevated creatinine and potassium levels, indicating possible renal impairment.
11. Decreased calcium and magnesium levels, which may require supplementation.
12. The patient's neurologic status is not assessed in the progress note, indicating a potential risk for neurologic complications.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management of the patient's condition."

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypoxia. She was initially concerned for pneumonia (PNA) but now presents with melena, which is likely secondary to known multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient has received one packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is now at 34%. She also has a chronic cough, recent echo showing decreased right ventricular (RV) function, and a right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia on chest x-ray. The patient has been on vancomycin and levofloxacin for 4 days. She has a history of sepsis, with fever and elevated lactate levels. Blood cultures have been negative, and there is doubt of line infection. The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week at [**Location (un)**]. She has experienced cramps during recent HD sessions. The patient's hypertension is managed with losartan and nifedipine. She has a history of epilepsy, and her last seizure was in [**2182**].

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient presented with fever, which is likely due to pneumonia, as evidenced by crackles at the bases of the lungs on physical examination. The patient has been receiving vancomycin and levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/78 to 156/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 3L. 

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating worsening renal function. The patient is currently on maintenance hemodialysis. 

The patient's blood count shows a slightly low white blood cell count and platelet count within normal limits. Other lab results are unremarkable. 

The patient has received packed red blood cells transfusion to address anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient is planned for angioplasty as an outpatient to address the gastrointestinal bleed. 

The patient's nutritional status is satisfactory, as he is tolerating regular diet. 

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable, with appropriate management for pneumonia, ESRD, and gastrointestinal bleed. However, close monitoring of renal function and blood counts is essential."
