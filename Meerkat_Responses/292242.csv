","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) who presents from a rehabilitation center with ICD firing for ventricular tachycardia (VTach). 

The patient experienced approximately eight episodes of VTach yesterday afternoon prior to admission, for which his ICD fired. He became unresponsive for approximately 5-10 seconds during these episodes and regained consciousness with ICD firing. It appears that the patient was not taking Amiodarone at the rehabilitation center. Device interrogation showed 25 firings in the last few weeks. He was given a Lidocaine bolus in the emergency department and was started on Lidocaine and Amiodarone gtts in the critical care unit. Lidocaine gtt was discontinued last evening, and the patient will transition amiodarone gtt to PO today, 400 mg TID, then 400mg Qdaily on discharge for one month.

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presents from a rehabilitation center with ICD firing for ventricular tachycardia (VTach). 

During the admission, the patient experienced approximately eight episodes of VTach prior to admission, with the ICD firing each time. He became unresponsive for about 5-10 seconds during these episodes and regained consciousness with ICD firing. It appears that the patient was not taking Amiodarone at the rehabilitation center. Device interrogation showed 25 firings in the last few weeks. The patient received a Lidocaine bolus in the emergency department and was started on Lidocaine and Amiodarone gttts in the critical care unit (CCU). Lidocaine gtt was discontinued last evening, and the transition of Amiodarone gtt to oral dosing will be done today, with a plan to continue Amiodarone 400 mg TID, then 400 mg Qdaily on discharge for one month. An Amiodarone level will be monitored (sendout).

The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI and CABG. He currently has chest pain in the setting of ICD firing. The first troponin was"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He presents from a rehabilitation center with his ICD (implanted cardioverter-defibrillator) firing for ventricular tachycardia. The patient was unresponsive for approximately 5-10 seconds during these episodes and regained consciousness with ICD firing. He was given a lidocaine bolus in the emergency department and started on lidocaine and amiodarone infusions in the critical care unit. The patient's ejection fraction is 20-25%, moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, and moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension. He has a history of blindness, anxiety, depression, and sleep apnea. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, atenolol, aspirin, isosorbide mononitrate, and simvastatin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which led to his admission. It is crucial to monitor his heart rhythm and adjust the medication regimen accordingly.
2. Systolic heart failure: The patient appears slightly fluid overloaded, and there are signs of fluid retention such as edema in the right lower extremity. Close monitoring of fluid balance and consideration of diuretic therapy may be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 86 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**], s/p
   AICD, AFib, who presents from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with ICD firing for VTach.
   .
   # VTach:  The patient had one episode sustained VT yesterday afternoon
   w/o ICD firing (HR150s)
 he remained conscious and mentating
   throughout the episode, although with some chest discomfort. Device
   interrogation showed no shocking in setting of interpreting VT as
   nonsustained. It appears that the patient was not taking Amiodarone at
   [**Hospital 328**] Rehab. Device interogation showed 25 firings in last month.  He
   was given a Lidocaine bolus in the ED and was started on Lidocaine and
   Amiodarone gtts in the CCU.  Lidocaine gtt was d/c
d [**8-22**] PM and pt
   transitioned to amio PO yesterday. In setting of repeat episode, Amio
   gtt was restarted in addition to PO.
    - Pt does reiterate DNR/DNI code status but wants ICD to stay on
   (through Russian interpreter)
    - F/U Amiodarone level (sendout)
    - TSH, free T4 WNL, monitor since pt had issues w/ hypothyroidism in
   past
    - Cont home Digoxin 0.125 qod
    - Replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
    - Continue Amiodarone gtt today as well as PO TID doses.  Plan to go
   to just PO tomorrow.
   .
   #. Systolic CHF:  The patient appeared slightly fluid overloaded on
   physical exam (trace edema in RLE, crackles heard on initial exam) ON.
   He was given Lasix 80mg yesterday but poor UOP so given Lasix 100mg IV
   bolus w/ good effect. Pt was still even in 8 hrs.
   - goal today even to 500mL negative, start with 80mg PO Lasix home
   dose, IV bolus ~2pm if needed.
   - d/c fluid restriction to imitate his home conditions. Follow daily
   weights.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**].  He
   has had chest pain in the CCU in setting of ICD firing.  First troponin
   was slightly elevated at 0.02 but trended down starting [**8-22**] 10am.  No
   acute ST-T wave changes were appreciated on ECG.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue home doses of ASA, Imdur, Zocor, Nitroglycerine.
    - Cont on home Atenolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Start Captopril 6.25 TID as tolerated
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Pt WBC increased from 8.8 to 14.7 today. Afebrile, CXR
   from [**8-22**] no e/o pneumonia.
   - UA equivocal. UCx sent
 will f/u
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   .
   #SLEEP APNEA: Pt has had episodic desat
s to 80
s during sleep.
   Observed to have breathing patterns consistent w/ sleep apnea. Pt
   complied with NC o/n w/o desats episodes. Will continue with NC when pt
   is sleeping
   .
   # Mental Status/Behavior: Pt has no mental status changes, remained
   lucid and oriented per interpreter. Asks continually for ice but
   cooperative yesterday and did not try to get out of bed o/n
   -          involve interpreter on phone as often as possible
   .
   #. Blindness:  The patient has a history of blindness, of unknown
   etiology.  He currently takes Alphagen, Trusopt, and Xalatam eye gtts.
    - Continue home regimen of eye gtts
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue Ativan 1.5 mg qhs and Lorazepam 0.5 mg q4h prn
   for anxiety.
   .
   # Depression:  Continue home dose of Lexapro.

   Disposition: CCU for now
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and is currently admitted to the ICU due to a recent episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was not terminated by the ICD. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, Lasix, digoxin, and various other medications for his underlying conditions. He has a history of blindness, anxiety, depression, and sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient's recent episode of VT indicates a potential risk for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the ICD and ongoing management of antiarrhythmic therapy will be necessary to prevent further episodes.

2. Heart Failure: The patient appears to have signs of systolic heart failure, as evidenced by fluid overload, trace edema in the lower extremities, and crackles on lung examination. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix and fluid restriction are being implemented to manage this condition.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an underlying infection. Additionally, his urine output has been poor, indicating a potential risk for acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management of fluid balance and electrolytes are crucial.

4. Sleep Apnea:"

The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He presents from a rehabilitation center with ventricular tachycardia (VTach) and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) that did not fire during the episode. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and it appears he was not taking amiodarone at the rehabilitation center. He was given a lidocaine bolus and started on lidocaine and amiodarone infusions in the emergency department. Lidocaine infusion was discontinued, and the patient transitioned to amiodarone orally yesterday. In setting of repeat VTach episode, amiodarone infusion was restarted in addition to oral administration.

The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR-DNI) code status but wants to keep his ICD on. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels are within normal limits, but the patient has had issues with hypothyroidism in the past. He is being monitored for this.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 86 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**], s/p
   AICD, AFib, who presents from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with ICD firing for VTach.
   .
   # VTach:  The patient had one episode sustained VT yesterday afternoon
   w/o ICD firing (HR150s)
 he remained conscious and mentating
   throughout the episode, although with some chest discomfort. Device
   interrogation showed no shocking in setting of interpreting VT as
   nonsustained. It appears that the patient was not taking Amiodarone at
   [**Hospital 328**] Rehab. Device interogation showed 25 firings in last month.  He
   was given a Lidocaine bolus in the ED and was started on Lidocaine and
   Amiodarone gtts in the CCU.  Lidocaine gtt was d/c
d [**8-22**] PM and pt
   transitioned to amio PO yesterday. In setting of repeat episode, Amio
   gtt was restarted in addition to PO.
   - Pt does reiterate DNR/DNI code status but wants ICD to stay on
   (through Russian interpreter)
    - F/U Amiodarone level (sendout)
    - TSH, free T4 WNL, monitor since pt had issues w/ hypothyroidism in
   past
    - Cont home Digoxin 0.125 qod
    - Replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   .
   #. Systolic CHF:  The patient appeared slightly fluid overloaded on
   physical exam (trace edema in RLE, crackles heard on initial exam) ON.
   He was given Lasix 80mg yesterday but poor UOP so given Lasix 100mg IV
   bolus w/ good effect. Pt was still even in 8 hrs.
   - goal today even to 500mL negative, start with 80mg PO Lasix home
   dose, IV bolus in afternoon if needed.
   - 1200cc fluid restriction, daily weights
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**].  He
   has had chest pain in the CCU in setting of ICD firing.  First troponin
   was slightly elevated at 0.02 but trended down starting [**8-22**] 10am.  No
   acute ST-T wave changes were appreciated on ECG.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue home doses of ASA, Imdur, Zocor, Nitroglycerine.
    - Cont on home Atenolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Start Captopril 6.25 TID as tolerated
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Pt WBC increased from 8.8 to 14.7 today. Afebrile, CXR
   from [**8-22**] no e/o pneumonia.
   - UA equivocal. UCx sent
 will f/u
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   .
   #SLEEP APNEA: Pt has had episodic desat
s to 80
s during sleep.
   Observed to have breathing patterns consistent w/ sleep apnea. Pt
   complied with NC o/n w/o desats episodes. Will continue with NC when pt
   is sleeping
   .
   # Mental Status/BEHAVIOR: Pt has no mental status changes, remained
   lucid and oriented per interpreter. Asks continually for ice but
   cooperative yesterday and did not try to get out of bed o/n
   -         involve interpreter on phone when possible
   .
   #. Blindness:  The patient has a history of blindness, of unknown
   etiology.  He currently takes Alphagen, Trusopt, and Xalatam eye gtts.
    - Continue home regimen of eye gtts
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue Ativan 1.5 mg qhs and Lorazepam 0.5 mg q4h prn
   for anxiety.
   .
   # Depression:  Continue home dose of Lexapro.

   wants his ICD to stay on
   Disposition: Call out to medicine
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He presents with sustained ventricular tachycardia and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing episodes of VTach without ICD firing and has been treated with amiodarone gtt and PO. He also has systolic congestive heart failure, leukocytosis, sleep apnea, mental status/anxiety/depression issues, and blindness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VTach): The patient's history of VTach and recent episode of sustained VTach indicate a potential risk for recurrent episodes. Close monitoring and management of antiarrhythmic therapy, such as amiodarone, will be important to prevent further VTach episodes.
2. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's trace edema in the right lower extremity and crackles heard on initial exam suggest fluid overload. Careful monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis management, such as Lasix administration, is crucial to prevent worsening of CHF symptoms.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's increased white blood cell count from 8.8 to 14.7 today may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. Further evaluation, including urine culture and monitoring for fever, is necessary to identify and treat any potential infection.

   Disposition: Call out to medicine
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He presents with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was not detected by his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and was managed with intravenous amiodarone. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on amiodarone therapy. He has been experiencing episodes of sleep apnea, and supplemental oxygen has been ordered at night. The patient's systolic heart failure is being managed with diuretics and fluid restriction. His leukocytosis is being monitored, and a urinary analysis culture has been sent due to an equivocal result. The patient has a history of blindness, anxiety, depression, and is currently receiving appropriate medications for these conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced a sustained episode of VT, which was not detected by his ICD. This highlights the need for close monitoring and appropriate management of arrhythmias in patients with ICDs.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient appears to have fluid overload, as indicated by trace edema and crackles on physical examination. Close monitoring of his fluid status and continued use of diuretics are essential to manage his CHF symptoms.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 86 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**], s/p
   AICD, AFib, who presents from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with ICD firing for VTach.
   .
   # VTach:  The patient had one episode sustained VT yesterday afternoon
   w/o ICD firing (HR150s)
 he remained conscious and mentating
   throughout the episode, although with some chest discomfort. Device
   interrogation showed no shocking in setting of interpreting VT as
   nonsustained. It appears that the patient was not taking Amiodarone at
   [**Hospital 328**] Rehab. Device interogation showed 25 firings in last month.  He
   was given a Lidocaine bolus in the ED and was started on Lidocaine and
   Amiodarone gtts in the CCU.  Lidocaine gtt was d/c
d [**8-22**] PM and pt
   transitioned to amio PO [**8-23**]. In setting of repeat episode, Amio gtt was
   restarted in addition to PO.
   - no further VT in 24 hrs
   - D/C amio gtt and cont on po amio 400 mg TID
    - Pt does reiterate DNR/DNI code status but wants ICD to stay on
   (through Russian interpreter)
    - F/U Amiodarone level (sendout)
    - TSH, free T4 WNL, monitor since pt had issues w/ hypothyroidism in
   past
    - Cont home Digoxin 0.125 qod
    - Replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   .
   #. Systolic CHF:  The patient  appears euvolemic on exam.
   - goal today even negative.
   - no fluid restriction to imitate his home conditions. Follow daily
   weights and give Lasix prn
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: Na has been trending down since began giving higher
   doses of Lasix, BUN and Cr has been trending up, now stable today.
   Likely most consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia from aggressive
   diuresis, but cannot rule out SIADH or primary polydipsia.
   -          hold Lasix for now
   -          urine lytes and osm
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**].  He
   has had chest pain in the CCU in setting of ICD firing.  First troponin
   was slightly elevated at 0.02 but trended down starting [**8-22**] 10am.  No
   acute ST-T wave changes were appreciated on ECG.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue home doses of ASA, Imdur, Zocor, Nitroglycerine.
    - Cont on home Atenolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Start Captopril 6.25 TID as tolerated
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Pt WBC increased from 8.8 to 14.7 today. Afebrile, CXR
   from [**8-22**] no e/o pneumonia.
   - UA equivocal. UCx sent
 will f/u
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   .
   #SLEEP APNEA: Pt has had episodic desat
s to 80
s during sleep.
   Observed to have breathing patterns consistent w/ sleep apnea. Pt
   complied with NC o/n w/o desats episodes. Will continue with NC when pt
   is sleeping
   .
   # Mental Status/Behavior: Pt has no mental status changes, remained
   lucid and oriented per interpreter. Asks continually for ice but
   cooperative yesterday and did not try to get out of bed o/n
   -          involve interpreter on phone as often as possible
   .
   #. Blindness:  The patient has a history of blindness, of unknown
   etiology.  He currently takes Alphagen, Trusopt, and Xalatam eye gtts.
    - Continue home regimen of eye gtts
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue Ativan 1.5 mg qhs and Lorazepam 0.5 mg q4h prn
   for anxiety.
   .
   # Depression:  Continue home dose of Lexapro.
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 86 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**], s/p
   AICD, AFib, who presents from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with ICD firing for VTach.
   .
   # VTach:  The patient had one episode sustained VT yesterday afternoon
   w/o ICD firing (HR150s)
 he remained conscious and mentating
   throughout the episode, although with some chest discomfort. Device
   interrogation showed no shocking in setting of interpreting VT as
   nonsustained. It appears that the patient was not taking Amiodarone at
   [**Hospital 328**] Rehab. Device interogation showed 25 firings in last month.  He
   was given a Lidocaine bolus in the ED and was started on Lidocaine and
   Amiodarone gtts in the CCU.  Lidocaine gtt was d/c
d [**8-22**] PM and pt
   transitioned to amio PO [**8-23**]. In setting of repeat episode, Amio gtt was
   restarted in addition to PO.
   - no further VT in 24 hrs
   - D/C amio gtt and cont on po amio 400 mg TID
    - Pt does reiterate DNR/DNI code status but wants ICD to stay on
   (through Russian interpreter)
    - F/U Amiodarone level (sendout)
    - TSH, free T4 WNL, monitor since pt had issues w/ hypothyroidism in
   past
    - Cont home Digoxin 0.125 qod
    - Replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   - confirm that pt would want external defibrillation if  ICD fails to
   shock for VT
   .
   #. Systolic CHF:  The patient  appears euvolemic on exam.
   - goal today even negative.
   - 120 mg Lasix PO this afternoon, reassess in AM
   - no fluid restriction to imitate his home conditions. Follow daily
   weights and give Lasix prn
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: Na has been trending down since began giving higher
   doses of Lasix, BUN and Cr has been trending up, now stable today.
   Likely due to primary polydipsia and low solute intake.
   - give juice, Ensure/fortified juices in place of ice water
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**].  He
   has had chest pain in the CCU in setting of ICD firing.  First troponin
   was slightly elevated at 0.02 but trended down starting [**8-22**] 10am.  No
   acute ST-T wave changes were appreciated on ECG.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue home doses of ASA, Imdur, Zocor, Nitroglycerine.
    - Cont on home Atenolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -  Start Captopril 6.25 TID as tolerated
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Pt WBC cont to increase, stable today from yesterday.
   Afebrile, CXR from [**8-22**] no e/o pneumonia.
   - UA equivocal. UCx sent
 will f/u
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   .
   #SLEEP APNEA: Pt has had episodic desat
s to 80
s during sleep.
   Observed to have breathing patterns consistent w/ sleep apnea. Pt
   complied with NC o/n w/o desats episodes. Will continue with NC when pt
   is sleeping
   .
   # Mental Status/Behavior: Pt has no mental status changes, remained
   lucid and oriented per interpreter. Asks continually for ice but
   cooperative yesterday and did not try to get out of bed o/n
   -          involve interpreter on phone as often as possible
   .
   #. Blindness:  The patient has a history of blindness, of unknown
   etiology.  He currently takes Alphagen, Trusopt, and Xalatam eye gtts.
    - Continue home regimen of eye gtts
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue Ativan 1.5 mg qhs and Lorazepam 0.5 mg q4h prn
   for anxiety.
   .
   # Depression:  Continue home dose of Lexapro.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VTach), for which he received lidocaine and amiodarone infusions. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, digoxin, aspirin, isosorbide mononitrate, atenolol, and captopril.

The patient's recent vital signs have been relatively stable, with a blood pressure range of 95/42-148/129 mmHg and a heart rate range of 70-72 beats per minute. His respiratory rate has been between 19-27 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation has been consistently above 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature has been within normal limits.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 14.7-16.9 K/uL, likely due to primary polydipsia and low solute intake. The patient's sodium levels have been trending down since starting higher doses of Lasix, but remain within normal range. The patient's kidney function, as indicated by creatinine levels, is stable."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He presents to the ICU with an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VTach) and requires treatment with intravenous amiodarone and oral amiodarone. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place.

The patient is also experiencing systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and leukocytosis. He has a history of sleep apnea and is being monitored for this condition. The patient's mental status/behavior is stable, and he is cooperative. He has a history of blindness and is on eye medications. He is also being treated for anxiety and depression.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/42 mmHg to 148/129 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for trace edema in the right lower extremity.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) from 14.7 to 16.9 K/uL, decreasing hemoglobin (Hct) from 41.9% to 39.9%, slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, and normal troponin-T levels. Other lab values such as potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and phosphate (PO4) are within normal limits.

The patient's medications include amiodarone, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), digoxin, and various cardiac medications. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) code status, but he wants his ICD to remain active.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening CHF, further episodes of VTach, worsening hypokalemia, worsening hyponatremia, and worsening leukocytosis. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, electrolyte levels, and cardiac status is essential to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 86 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**], s/p
   AICD, AFib, who presents from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with ICD firing for VTach.
   .
   # VTach:  The patient had one episode sustained VT [**8-23**] w/o ICD firing
   (HR150s)
 he remained conscious and mentating throughout the episode,
   although with some chest discomfort. Device interrogation showed no
   shocking in setting of interpreting VT as nonsustained. It appears that
   the patient was not taking Amiodarone at [**Hospital 328**] Rehab. Device
   interogation showed 25 firings in last month.  He was given a Lidocaine
   bolus in the ED and was started on Lidocaine and Amiodarone gtts in the
   CCU.  Lidocaine gtt was d/c
d [**8-22**] PM and pt transitioned to amio PO
   [**8-23**]. In setting of repeat episode, Amio gtt was restarted in addition
   to PO.
   - no further VT in 48 hrs
   - cont on po amio 400 mg TID
    - Pt does reiterate DNR/DNI code status but wants ICD to stay on and
   would want external defibrillation if ICD fails  (through Russian
   interpreter)
    - F/U Amiodarone level (sendout)
    - Cont home Digoxin 0.125 qod
    - Replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   .
   #. Systolic CHF:  The patient  appears euvolemic on exam. Received 120
   mg Lasix PO last evening, UOP 30-240 cc/hr.
   - goal today even negative.
   - no fluid restriction to imitate his home conditions. Follow daily
   weights and give Lasix prn
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: Na has been trending down since began giving higher
   doses of Lasix, BUN and Cr has been trending up. Likely euvolemic, due
   to primary polydipsia and low solute intake/high free water intake.
   -          give juice, Powerade, Ensure/fortified juices in place of
   ice water
   -          consider Urine lytes and Osm
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Pt WBC cont to increase, 16 to 21.2 today. Afebrile,
   CXR from [**8-22**] no e/o pneumonia.
   - UA equivocal. UCx negative
   - consider repeat CXR, C. dif
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**].  He
   has had chest pain in the CCU in setting of ICD firing.  First troponin
   was slightly elevated at 0.02 but trended down starting [**8-22**] 10am.  No
   acute ST-T wave changes were appreciated on ECG.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue home doses of ASA, Imdur, Zocor, Nitroglycerine.
    - Cont on home Atenolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -  Start Captopril 6.25 TID as tolerated
   .
   .
   #SLEEP APNEA: Pt has had episodic desat
s to 80
s during sleep.
   Observed to have breathing patterns consistent w/ sleep apnea. Pt
   complied with NC o/n w/o desats episodes. Will continue with NC when pt
   is sleeping
   .
   # Mental Status/Behavior: Pt has no mental status changes, remained
   lucid and oriented per interpreter. Asks continually for ice but
   cooperative yesterday and did not try to get out of bed o/n
   -          involve interpreter on phone as often as possible
   .
   #. Blindness:  The patient has a history of blindness, of unknown
   etiology.  He currently takes Alphagen, Trusopt, and Xalatam eye gtts.
    - Continue home regimen of eye gtts
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue Ativan 1.5 mg qhs and Lorazepam 0.5 mg q4h prn
   for anxiety.
   .
   # Depression:  Continue home dose of Lexapro.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, including previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, as well as atrial fibrillation. He presents to the ICU from a rehabilitation center with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing for ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient was not taking amiodarone at the rehabilitation center, and ICD interrogation showed 25 firings in the last month. He received a lidocaine bolus in the emergency department and was started on lidocaine and amiodarone infusions in the critical care unit (CCU). The patient's VT episodes have been controlled for 48 hours, and he is currently on oral amiodarone 400 mg three times a day. The patient desires to continue with ICD therapy and wants external defibrillation if the ICD fails.

The patient appears euvolemic and has received 120 mg of Lasix orally last evening. His urine output is 30-240 cc/hr, and he has no evidence of fluid overload. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance. The patient will be followed daily with weights and given Lasix as needed. There are no restrictions on fluid intake at this time.

The patient's sodium levels have been trending down since starting higher doses of Lasix, along with increased BUN and"

   wants his ICD to stay on
   Disposition: call out to the floor.
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has a defibrillator in place due to atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. The patient presented from a rehabilitation center with an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia that was not shocked by the defibrillator. He was given amiodarone intravenously and restarted on oral amiodarone. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status but wants to continue with the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and desires external defibrillation if the ICD fails. He also has systolic congestive heart failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, sleep apnea, blindness, anxiety, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia recurrence: Given the patient's history of VT and the recent episode while in the ICU, there is a risk of further episodes of VT.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of an ICD increase the risk of other cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's systolic CHF may worsen due to fluid overload or inadequate diuresis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 86 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**], s/p
   AICD, AFib, who presents from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab with ICD firing for VTach.
   .
   # VTach:  The patient had one episode sustained VT [**8-23**] w/o ICD firing
   (HR150s)
 not shocked as read as NSVT.  It appears that the patient
   was not taking Amiodarone at [**Hospital 328**] Rehab. Device interogation showed
   25 firings in last month.  In setting of repeat episode, Amio gtt was
   restarted in addition to PO.
   - no further VT last 48 hrs
   - cont on po amio 400 mg TID
    - Pt does reiterate DNR/DNI code status but wants ICD to stay on and
   would want external defibrillation if ICD fails  (through Russian
   interpreter)
    - F/U Amiodarone level (sendout)
    - Cont home Digoxin 0.125 qod
    - Replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   .
   #. Systolic CHF:  The patient  appears euvolemic on exam. Received 120
   mg Lasix PO last evening, UOP 30-240 cc/hr.
   - goal today even negative.
   - no fluid restriction to imitate his home conditions. Follow daily
   weights and give Lasix prn
   .
   # HYPONATREMIA: Na has been trending down since began giving higher
   doses of Lasix, BUN and Cr has been trending up. Likely euvolemic, due
   to primary polydipsia and low solute intake/high free water intake.
   - Will try free water restriction. Ensure/fortified juices in place of
   ice water. Can feed broth.
   - consider Urine lytes and Osm
   - ? SIADH.  Recheck FE Urea
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Pt WBC cont to increase, 16 to 21.2 today. Afebrile,
   CXR from [**8-22**] no e/o pneumonia.
   - UA equivocal. UCx negative
   - repeat CXR, UA.  Check blood cx and c. diff.
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**].  He
   has had chest pain in the CCU in setting of ICD firing.  First troponin
   was slightly elevated at 0.02 but trended down starting [**8-22**] 10am.  No
   acute ST-T wave changes were appreciated on ECG.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue home doses of ASA, Imdur, Zocor, Nitroglycerine.
    - Cont on home Atenolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -  Start Captopril 6.25 TID as tolerated
   .
   .
   #SLEEP APNEA: Pt has had episodic desat
s to 80
s during sleep.
   Observed to have breathing patterns consistent w/ sleep apnea. Pt
   complied with NC o/n w/o desats episodes. Will continue with NC when pt
   is sleeping
   .
   # Mental Status/Behavior: Pt has no mental status changes, remained
   lucid and oriented per interpreter. Has recently been more cooperative.
   - interpreter at 1pm.
   .
   #. Blindness:  The patient has a history of blindness, of unknown
   etiology.  He currently takes Alphagen, Trusopt, and Xalatam eye gtts.
    - Continue home regimen of eye gtts
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue Ativan 1.5 mg qhs and Lorazepam 0.5 mg q4h prn
   for anxiety.
   .
   # Depression:  Continue home dose of Lexapro.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 8374**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Continuing management of CHF.  Investigating hyponatremia.
   Patient care 40 minutes.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2147-8-26**] 11:06 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presents from a rehabilitation center with ICD firing for ventricular tachycardia (VTach).

1. VTach: The patient had one episode of sustained VT without ICD firing (heart rate 150s) that was not shocked as read as nonsustained VTach. The patient was not taking amiodarone at the rehabilitation center. Device interrogation showed 25 firings in the last month. In the setting of repeat episodes, amiodarone was restarted in addition to oral administration.

2. Systolic CHF: The patient appears euvolemic on examination. He received 120 mg of Lasix PO last evening, and his urine output is 30-240 cc/hr. The goal is to achieve an even negative balance. No fluid restriction will be imposed to imitate home conditions. Daily weights and Lasix as needed will be given.

3. HYPONATREMIA: Sodium levels have been trending down since higher doses of Lasix were initiated. BUN and creatinine have been trending up. This is likely euvolemic due to primary polydipsia and low solute intake"
