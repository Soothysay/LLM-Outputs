","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). He presents with newly diagnosed portal hypertension, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient developed black tarry stools, indicative of melena. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed diffuse superficial ulceration with stigmata of bleeding and non-bleeding varices.

The patient has been started on various medications including octreotide, pantoprazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and others. He is also receiving IV fluids and blood products as needed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 126/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with erythema and skin sloughing on the right lower extremity. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and distended. He has no peripheral edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and cellulitis. They have a history of cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes mellitus type II, and ascites. The patient experienced fever, tachycardia, and hypertension overnight and received intravenous fluids (IVF). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed diffuse ulceration in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, with stigmata of recent bleeding but no evidence of active bleeding from varices. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) trended down to 29%, and white blood cell count (WBC) peaked at 14.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient's current condition of an upper GI bleed poses a risk of continued bleeding, leading to hypotension, shock, and potential organ failure.
2. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient's underlying cirrhosis can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and increased susceptibility to infections.
3. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis, if left untreated or worsened, could progress to deeper tissue infections or systemic infection, increasing the risk of sepsis.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Given the patient's history of diabetes mellitus type II, poor glycemic control can lead to DKA, characterized by hyperglyc"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). He presented with newly diagnosed portal hypertension, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 

The patient experienced melena overnight, resulting in a slight decrease in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). The following assessments and plans were made:

1. GI bleeding:
   - Maintain active traction/suction
   - Maintain two large bore intravenous (IV) lines
   - Administer intravenous pantoprazole (ADAT) and sucralfate
   - Monitor hematocrit every 12 hours
   - Continue octreotide infusion until this afternoon
   - Consult liver team for further recommendations
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or target hematocrit level > 25

2. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD):
   - Initiate intravenous pantoprazole
   - Administer sucralfate
   - Follow up Helicobacter pylori test
   - Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
   - Consider endoscopic biopsy after several days of pantoprazole therapy

3. Cellulitis:
   - Unclear etiology, possibly related to underlying vasculitis or pyoderma gangrenosum

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) who presented with newly diagnosed portal hypertension, lower extremity cellulitis, and was transferred to the MICU for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has melena, a positive urine anion gap consistent with renal tubular acidosis type IV, and is being started on clear liquids. A biopsy of the wound at the bedside was done, and plastics will take the patient to the operating room on Friday morning. ID recommendations include checking Lennis, while liver recommendations suggest changing PPI to [Hospital1] IV and continuing octreotide for another 24 hours. The patient's son was updated, and the patient started on nadolol. The patient has positive antibodies for hepatitis A, B, C, and smooth muscle. He also had schistosomiasis as a teenager. Urinalysis showed many uric acid crystals. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has melena, indicating a possible upper GI bleed. This could lead to significant blood loss and hypovolemic shock.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has lower extremity cellulitis, which can progress and cause sepsis if not treated appropriately.
3. Portal hypertension: The patient has newly diagnosed portal hypertension, which can lead to complications such as variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). He presented with newly diagnosed portal hypertension, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and was transferred to the MICU for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 

In the MICU, the patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed diffuse superficial ulceration with stigmata of bleeding, as well as non-bleeding varices. The cause of the GI bleed is suspected to be portal hypertension. 

The patient's cellulitis was debrided at the bedside by plastics, but the etiology of the infection is unclear. It appears similar to a burn and may be secondary to underlying vasculitis or pyoderma gangrenosum. A biopsy has been recommended for further evaluation.

The patient's current medical complications include hypoxemia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), portal hypertension, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, tachycardia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and febrile neutropenia.

The patient's treatment plan includes monitoring his blood and urine cultures, administering intravenous (IV) proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), sucralfate, octreotide, and"

   toxic ingestions
   - IV PPI
   - sucralfate
   - f/u H. pylori
   - Avoid NSAIDs
   - consider biopsy after several days of PPI
   .
   Cellulitis:. Etiology unclear. Possible vasculitis. [**Month (only) 11**] have underlying
   hepatitis with associated cryoglobulinemia. Also could be secondary to
   pyoderma gangrenosum. However is most likely cellulitis or possible
   infected burn.
   - f/u cryoglobulins
   - continue zosyn and vanco to cover
   - f/u cultures
   - Appreciate plastics and [**Doctor First Name **] recs, ID recs
   - monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - silvadine [**Hospital1 **]

   # Hypoxemia: ? pleural effusions, volume overload, less likely pna
   given CXR and low grade fevers. Likely atelectasis
   - watch O2
   .
   Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to cellulitis, Improving on Abx. Urine
   culture negative, blood cultures pending.
   - culture if spikes
   - monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue vanco zosyn
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   ARF: UNa less than 10. Likely prerenal. Fena 0.17. No evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Also consider HRS as cause of prerenal, but BP higher
   than would expect. LOS fluid balance positive several liters and Cr not
   improving.  Also concerning for intrinsic renal diseae since has UA
   with uric acid crystals
   - will check uric acid level
   - challenge with albumin today
   - monitor creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - IVFs to keep MAP> 65
   .
   Portal hypertension: Unclear etiology of liver disease. Per medical
   records no history of alcohol abuse. Ferritin elevated but probably in
   the setting of acute infection and less likely  to be secondary to iron
   overload. Borderline elevated AST is nonspecific. [**Doctor First Name **] positive, RF
   mildly elevated, Sm Ab +, HCV are all positive
   - check Hep C viral load and genotype
   - lactulose to titrate to BMs TID
   - will continue nadolol
   - monitor LFTs
   - appreciate liver recs
   - will check HIV test
   .
   Elevated LFTs: Obstructive picture with high alk phos and hi Tbili
   mostly direct. No evidence of stones on ruq u/s.
   - trend LFTS
   Non anion gap acidosis: ? secondary to primary respiratory process vs.
   [**1-21**] saline, diarrhea, RTA
   - check urine anion gap

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) who presented with newly diagnosed portal hypertension, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:
1. GI bleeding: The patient has melena, which indicates upper GI bleeding. The plan includes maintaining active T/S, monitoring HCT, transfusing for active bleeding or HCT goal > 25, and continuing octreotide and IV PPI.
2. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD): The patient may have PUD, possibly due to Helicobacter pylori infection. The plan includes IV PPI, sucralfate, follow-up for H. pylori, avoiding NSAIDs, and considering a biopsy after several days of PPI.
3. Cellulitis: The patient has LLE cellulitis with an unclear etiology. Possible causes include vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, or an infected burn. The plan includes following up on cryoglobulins, continuing Zosyn and Vancomycin to cover, following cultures, and appreciating plastics and ID recs.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient has low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 95%). The cause may be pleural effusions,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) who presented with newly diagnosed portal hypertension, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. GI bleed: The patient's Hct has leveled out at 28, indicating that there is no ongoing significant blood loss. The octreotide drip has been stopped, and the plan is to maintain active tamponade and support, continue sucralfate, monitor hematocrit (Hct) every 12 hours, and provide intravenous pantoprazole (Protonix).

2. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD): There is a possibility of Helicobacter pylori infection, and no toxic ingestions were reported. The plan includes continuing intravenous pantoprazole, sucralfate, following up on H. pylori, avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and considering a biopsy after several days of pantoprazole.

3. Cellulitis: The etiology is unclear, but possible vasculitis or cryoglobulinemia associated with hepatitis is being considered. It could also be secondary to pyoderma gangrenosum. The plan includes following up on cryoglobulins, continuing zosyn and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He presents with newly diagnosed portal hypertension, lower left extremity cellulitis, and was transferred to the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including possible hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic hepatitis C infection, and pyoderma gangrenosum. He also has acute renal failure, which did not respond to albumin treatment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing GI bleeding, which is a serious condition that can lead to hypotension, shock, and even death if not managed promptly.
2. Hepatitis C Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C infection, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure if left untreated.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure did not respond to albumin treatment, indicating a possible intrinsic renal disease or hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Cellulitis: The patient has lower left extremity cellulitis, which if untreated, can spread and lead to systemic infection and sepsis.
5. Portal Hypertension: The patient has newly diagnosed portal hypertension, which is a complication of liver disease and can lead to variceal bleeding and other serious complications.
6. Pyoderma Gangrenosum: The patient has been diagnosed with pyoderma gangrenosum, a rare skin"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). He presented with newly diagnosed portal hypertension, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI bleed: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has stabilized at 28, indicating no active bleeding. Octreotide drip has been stopped, and the patient is being monitored closely. The plan includes maintaining active traction on the nasogastric (NG) tube, ensuring two large bore intravenous (IV) lines, administering sucralfate, and providing pantoprazole (Protonix).
2. Pyloric ulcer disease (PUD): The patient is suspected to have a possible H. pylori infection. Treatment includes IV pantoprazole, sucralfate, and follow-up for H. pylori testing.
3. Cellulitis: The etiology of the cellulitis is unclear, but possible causes include vasculitis, hepatitis with associated cryoglobulinemia, or pyoderma gangrenosum. Treatment involves continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), monitoring fever curve and white blood cell count, and awaiting culture results.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and complications. The patient has cirrhosis of the liver and right leg cellulitis. The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, and type II diabetes mellitus.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further internal bleeding and require repeated endoscopy for evaluation and management. Acute renal failure indicates impaired kidney function, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate interventions to prevent worsening. The patient's type II diabetes mellitus needs to be managed with insulin therapy to maintain glycemic control.

Additionally, the patient's cellulitis requires ongoing wound care and may necessitate a skin biopsy for further evaluation. The presence of cryoglobulin suggests a possible underlying autoimmune condition, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which is consistent with the patient's HCV serology and viral load pending results.

Overall, the patient requires careful monitoring and management of multiple medical conditions and potential complications. Close collaboration between specialists, including gastroenterologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and infectious disease specialists, may be necessary to optimize the patient's care."
