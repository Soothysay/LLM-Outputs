","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease with CABG, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and osteosarcoma of the right leg. He underwent a resection of the osteosarcoma and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, pain management, hypotension, anemia, and other complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires ongoing respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). His blood pressure remains low, and he is receiving intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. He also has a central venous line, arterial line, and peripheral IV lines. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD puts him at risk for respiratory failure. He is currently extubated but requires oxygen supplementation and NIPPV to maintain adequate oxygenation. Close monitoring of respiratory function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Fat Emboli Syndrome: Given the recent surgery involving the right leg, there is a concern for fat emboli during the procedure, which can lead to respiratory distress and potentially worsen the patient's respiratory failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite receiving"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and osteosarcoma of the right leg, underwent a resection of the osteosarcoma. The patient experienced difficulty in extubation and continued drainage from a leg drain. 

The patient is currently on oxygen via high flow nasal cannula and is being weaned off ventilatory support. Pain management is being provided through an epidural, which is planned to be removed today. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and there are ongoing efforts to remove the arterial line. Anemia is present, and serial hematocrits are being monitored. 

The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. Medications include statins and anticoagulants. The patient is expected to be transferred to the orthopedic service today.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and osteosarcoma of the right leg. The patient underwent resection and reconstruction of the right leg and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been extubated but requires supplemental oxygen. There are concerns about possible fat emboli during the procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD puts him at risk for respiratory failure. Being on oxygen and the possibility of weaning to a nasal cannula if he improves with diuresis are noted.
2. Fat Emboli: The patient had a major surgery involving the right leg, which increases the risk of fat emboli. Monitoring for signs of fat emboli, such as sudden respiratory distress, is important.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable but has been hypotensive in the past. Holding metoprolol and considering removal of the arterial line today are mentioned.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Serial HCTs are planned, and crossmatched units are being actively screened for transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin level above 30 while actively bleeding.
5. Osteosarcoma: The patient had a resection of the tumor in the"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and osteosarcoma of the right leg. The patient underwent a resection of the osteosarcoma and reconstruction of the right leg. He experienced difficulty extubating and continues to drain from a leg drain. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to a history of COPD, with oxygen dependence and concerns of possible fat emboli during the procedure. There is also a concern for pneumonia, as indicated by a CT chest showing likely aspiration pneumonia in the right middle lobe. Antibiotics were started last night. 

The patient is also experiencing pain, which is well-controlled with an epidural. The goal is to remove the epidural tomorrow. 

Additionally, the patient has hypotension, which has improved but is now more hypertensive. Blood pressure monitoring will continue. 

The patient is experiencing itching, possibly from the epidural medication or dressing. Antihistamines such as Nadir and Atarax will be tried, along with cold compresses as needed. The epidural will be removed tomorrow.

The patient has anemia secondary to surgery, with a stable hematocrit level of 30%. Serial hct levels will be monitored, and crossmatched units will be available. 

The patient has osteosarcoma that was re"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and now post-resection of osteosarcoma of the right leg. The patient had difficulty extubating and continued drainage from a leg drain.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on oxygen. There is concern for possible fat emboli during the surgical procedure. The patient was extubated but required supplemental oxygen. A plan is in place to wean off oxygen if the patient improves with diuresis.
2. Pain: The patient underwent resection and reconstruction of the right leg. The epidural dose was increased again this morning, with a goal to remove the epidural tomorrow.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure improved, but the patient still has an arterial line. Blood products are being given as needed, and metoprolol home dose is being held. The removal of the arterial line is being considered today.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and serial hematocrits are being done. Crossmatched units are being screened, and transfusion is planned to maintain a hemoglobin level above 30 while actively bleeding.
5. Osteosarcoma: The patient underwent resection of the tumor in the right leg"

The patient's arterial line stopped at 03:02 PM on [date]. Despite diuresis, the patient continues to require supplemental oxygen at 45%, raising concerns for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, which showed no evidence of PE but revealed extensive emphysema with new bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and increased consolidation at the right lung base. These findings could indicate sequelae of aspiration. The patient was started on antibiotics and received levo and flagyl.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 36.9 to 36.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 84 and 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 150/63 to 159/69 mmHg, respiratory rate between 27 and 17 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm,"

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  67 yo M with cad, cabg, copd on home o2,
   admitted for RLE osteosarcoma resection/reconstruction.  Course c/b
   post-op resp failure requiring reintubation, extubated 3 days
   ago. Continued O2 requirement felt [**2-1**] asp pna. CTA neg for PE.

   Continued O2 requirement in pt with asp pna in setting of significant
   underlying emphysema. Improving slowly with decreasing O2 needs and
   improving leukocytosis on antibx. Agree with plan to continue nebs,
   mucolytics, and levo/flagyl to complete 7 day course for asp pna. As pt
   is improving, not wheezy on exam, and without clear reactive component
   to copd will hold on steroids.  Leukocytosis has resolved with antibx
   and he remains af.  Continue gentle diuresis as fluid likely further
   impacting oxygenation. Continue metoprolol for htn which is better
   controlled. Con

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and now post-resection of osteosarcoma of the right leg. He was admitted for the osteosarcoma resection and reconstruction but developed postoperative respiratory failure requiring reintubation. He was extubated three days ago and continues to require supplemental oxygen due to aspiration pneumonia (asp PNA). The patient's condition is improving slowly, with decreasing oxygen needs and improving leukocytosis on antibiotics. The patient has stable hemoglobin levels at 30% and is on metoprolol for hypertension. His pain is well-controlled with opioid medications. There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal airway, breathing, and circulation. He has decreased chest wall movement post-amputation, without wheezing or rales in the lungs, and has a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient's laboratory values show resolving leukocytosis, stable hemoglobin, potassium, and creatinine levels. The patient's main issues include hypoxia related to the aspiration pneumonia, anemia secondary to surgery, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and osteosarcoma of the right leg. He underwent a resection of the osteosarcoma and is currently in the ICU for postoperative care.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, pain, anemia, osteosarcoma, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and hyperlipidemia. The plan is to continue weaning off oxygen, perform sputum cultures, administer lasix for fluid management, and provide nebulizations every six hours.

Regarding the potential medical complications that can arise, the patient's respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia may lead to further respiratory distress or infection. The presence of an epidural and subsequent removal could result in complications such as bleeding or nerve damage. The patient's anemia may require transfusions, which carry the risk of transfusion reactions or infections. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and hyperlipidemia should be monitored closely to prevent any exacerbation of these conditions."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and osteosarcoma of the right leg. The patient underwent a resection of the osteosarcoma and reconstruction of the right leg. 

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, pain, hypotension, itching, anemia, osteosarcoma, and hypertension. 

For respiratory failure, the patient has a history of COPD and is currently on oxygen. The patient was recently extubated but is still dependent on supplemental oxygen. There is a concern for possible fat emboli during the procedure and pneumonia, as indicated by a CT scan of the chest showing likely aspiration pneumonia in the right middle lobe. The plan includes continuing levofloxacin and metronidazole, working on weaning oxygen as tolerated, obtaining sputum cultures, administering Lasix to promote fluid removal, using nebulizers every six hours, and considering steroids if there is no improvement.

For pain management, the patient has an epidural in place, which is providing well-controlled pain post-surgery. The goal is to remove the epidural tomorrow, and anesthesia recommendations will be followed.

Regarding hypotension, the patient's blood pressure is now improved but has become hypertensive. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended, and met"
