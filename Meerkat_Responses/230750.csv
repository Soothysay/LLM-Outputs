","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She presents with cholecystitis and has undergone an ERCP procedure to remove biliary sludge and perform a sphincterotomy. Her labs indicate gallstone pancreatitis, and her LFTs and amylase/lipase are trending downwards. The patient is experiencing nausea, which is being managed with Zofran PRN, and pain, which is being managed with morphine PRN. There is a possibility of an interval cholecystectomy. The patient is also in atrial fibrillation with occasional bursts of rapid ventricular response. She is currently on IV lopressor and will have a repeat ECG in the afternoon. She has completed a course of macrobid for a recent urinary tract infection. The patient has leukocytosis, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause. She is receiving IV levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI."

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis. She underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday, which included sludge removal and sphincterotomy. The patient is currently experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Her recent lab results show leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. She is being treated with antibiotics, pain medication, and antiemetics. The plan is to continue NPO, administer IV fluids, and repeat EKG in the afternoon. The patient also has a history of urinary tract infection, which is being treated with Macrobid. Her code status is DNR/DNI, and she will be monitored in the ICU for rate control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholecystitis: The patient has ongoing symptoms of abdominal pain, which could indicate persistent inflammation of the gallbladder.
2. Gallstone Pancreatitis: Although her lab values are trending downwards, the patient may still be at risk for complications associated with pancreatitis, such as persistent abdominal pain or organ dysfunction.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's irregularly irregular rhythm and elevated heart rate suggest uncontrolled atrial fibrillation. If left untreated, it can lead to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac complications.

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She presented with cholecystitis, and her assessment reveals a possible gallstone pancreatitis as well. She underwent ERCP yesterday, which she tolerated well. She complains of abdominal pain and is taking morphine for it. She also experiences nausea when awake and is on Zofran. The patient has multiple allergies to medications. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/72 to 90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She is in atrial fibrillation with occasional bursts of rapid ventricular response. Physical examination reveals tender abdomen, especially in the right upper quadrant, bibasilar crackles in the lungs, and dry skin with 1+ pulses bilaterally. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows findings consistent with cholecystitis. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving IV fluids. She is on IV antibiotics and is being considered for an interval cholecystectomy. The plan includes monitoring for ECG changes, checking digoxin levels, and following up on urine culture data. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cholecystitis, which is an inflammation of the gallbladder. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/65 mmHg to 152/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is currently on metoprolol, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), famotidine, and other medications.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 18.5, hemoglobin (Hct) at 37.6, and platelet count (Plt) at 7503. The creatinine (Cr) level is 0.6, troponin T is 0.01, glucose is within normal range, and other lab values are mostly within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,788 mL with 533 mL output via IV fluids, resulting in a positive balance of 3,255 mL. The patient's urine output is 2,195 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals atrial fibrillation and peripheral vascular pulses not assessed. The patient's skin"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She presents with cholecystitis and has undergone an ERCP procedure. Her labs show evidence of gallstone pancreatitis, but LFTs and amylase/lipase levels are trending downwards. She is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving intravenous fluids. She is also on medication for nausea, pain, and potential interval cholecystectomy.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cholecystitis s/p ERCP: The patient had an ERCP procedure to remove biliary sludge and perform a sphincterotomy. She has gallstone cholecystitis and labs consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. Her LFTs and amylase/lipase levels are trending downwards. She is NPO, receiving LR (lactated Ringer's) at 150, and being monitored for any complications.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with occasional bursts of rapid ventricular response (RVR) up to 120s. She is currently NPO and holding oral medications. IV lopressor 5 mg is given every 6 hours, and the frequency can be increased if necessary.
3. ECG changes: There are ECG changes, possibly due to digoxin effect. Digoxin level is 1.4, and there"
