   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and was found to have a large, necrotic duodenal ulcer with scant bleeding. No intervention was undertaken due to the tenuous appearance of the ulcer. The patient received a transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), resulting in a hematocrit (Hct) rise from 13% to 30%. The patient has been holding stable.

Allergies include Compazine injection (prochlorperazine edisylate). The patient's last dose of antibiotics was not specified. Infusions include fentanyl and midazolam. Other ICU medications are not mentioned. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, and some degree of voluntary guarding. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 77 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 93/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,802 mL, including 178 mL of parenteral nutrition (TF), 2,769 mL of intravenous fluids (IVF), and 1,033 mL of blood products. The total output includes 2,425 mL of urine, 505 mL of drain output, and 327 mL of nasogastric (NG) output. The patient's respiratory support includes delivery through a nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's ABG results are not provided in the note.

The patient's physical examination reveals general appearance as a well-nourished, non-acute distress, thin, cachectic individual. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds without murmurs or rubs. Peripheral vascular examination shows present pulses in both upper and lower extremities. Respiratory/chest examination reveals symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination shows tenderness in all four quadrants, right greater than left, with some degree of voluntary guarding. Extremities examination reveals absent pulses in the right arm. Musculoskeletal examination shows muscle wasting. Skin examination is warm. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, responding appropriately, and exhibiting purposeful movement with unassessed tone.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.3%, platelet count of 209,000/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 32 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 111 mg/dL, and troponin T of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with chronic pancreatitis who presented with severe acute blood loss anemia likely due to an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient described melena, which indicates bleeding in the upper GI tract. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, revealing gastritis and a necrotic duodenal ulcer with slow bleeding. No intervention was undertaken due to the tenuous appearance of the ulcer. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has a stable hematocrit level of 29%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient's duodenal ulcer appears necrotic, which increases the risk of re-bleeding. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and repeated measurements of hematocrit are necessary.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as an elevated white blood cell count, and following up with blood cultures are important.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. Monitoring renal function and ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation are essential.
4. Malnutrition: The patient has been NPO (nothing by mouth) and has anorexia. Nutritional support may be required to prevent malnutrition"

   A single cratered 2cm ulcer was found in the proximal bulb. The ulcer
   bed appeared necrotic with pigmented material suggestive of recent
   bleeding. There was thick dark material adherent to the ulcer (food vs.
   old blood) which could not be fully cleared. Because it was difficult
   to get a clear view of the ulcer base and vessel, we decided against
   intervening at present.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old woman with chronic pancreatitis and severe acute blood less
   anemia, likely from an upper source given her description of melena.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed:  Prior EGD from [**2182**]
   revealed gastritis, confirmed by biopsy.  EGD showed necrotic duodenal
   ulcer with only a slow ooze.  No intervention taken given tenuous
   appearance.  Patient received 5 U PRBCs.  Hct of 29 and stable.
   - s/p 5U PRBCs, follow q8h hct.
   - NPO until 4pm, - clear liquid diet over weekend is ok if pt remains
   stable.
   - Will plan for re-scope on Monday in endoscopy unit after futher
   stabilization
   - a-line for BP monitoring given that her thin body habitus is likely
   causing NIBP to underestimate her actual BP
   IV PPI 80mg bolus then 8mg/hr x 72 hours.
   - Active T&C, 4 units crossed
   - q 4 hour hematocrits
   - has 4 large bore PIVs currently
   - hold aspirin
   #Fever.  Fever last night.  No elevation of WBC, no infectious sx.
   Follow up blood cx.
   - Given possibility of microperforation in the setting of fever, will
   get CT scan to evaluate.

   ## Chronic pancreatitis:
   - prn morphine for pain; NPO for upper GI bleed
   .
   ## Anorexia:
   - hold PO psych meds for now; may resume p EGD

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with chronic pancreatitis and severe acute blood loss anemia likely due to an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has a history of gastritis confirmed by biopsy. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a necrotic duodenal ulcer with only a slow ooze. No intervention was taken due to the tenuous appearance of the ulcer. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is currently stable at 29%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals tenderness in all four quadrants of the abdomen, right and left radial and dorsalis pedis pulses present, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and muscle wasting.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin concentration of 23.0 g/dL, platelet count of 209 x 10^9/L, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 111 mg/dL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.0. Imaging reveals evidence of old healed apical granulomatous disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as a single cratered 2cm ulcer in the proximal bulb with a necrotic ulcer bed.

The plan includes continuing blood pressure monitoring via arterial line due to the patient's thin body habitus, administration of intravenous pantoprazole (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and close monitoring of hematocrit levels every four hours. The patient will remain NPO until 4pm, followed by a clear liquid diet over the weekend if stable. A repeat EGD is planned for Monday in the endoscopy unit after further stabilization. The patient is also being evaluated for potential microperforation given the presence of fever, with a CT scan ordered to assess.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening anemia, infection (due to immunosuppression and risk of aspiration), gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory complications (such as pneumonia), and renal dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis, presenting with 3 weeks of melena, severe hematocrit drop, and a necrotic duodenal ulcer seen on endoscopy. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently stable with a hematocrit of 29.5%. The patient is tolerating full liquid diet and has advanced to clear liquids. Blood and urine cultures were sent due to a low-grade fever of unknown etiology. Imaging shows unchanged chronic pancreatitis, multiple hypodense kidney lesions, bilateral kidney scarring, moderate ascites, moderate right and small left pleural effusion, and unchanged extrahepatic and mild intrahepatic bile duct dilatation since the last MRI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding from the necrotic duodenal ulcer.
2. Infection due to the presence of fever and potential contamination from the ulcer.
3. Hypotension due to ongoing internal bleeding or sepsis.
4. Kidney dysfunction or failure due to hypoperfusion or ongoing kidney damage.
5. Respiratory compromise due to pleural effusion.
6. Hepatic complications due to bile duct dilatation and potential obstruction.
7. Gastrointestinal perforation.

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis, anorexia, and bulimia gastritis presenting with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and her hematocrit levels are now stable. The plan is to recheck her hematocrit every 12 hours and keep it at approximately 30. No further transfusion is needed at this time. She will receive intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 72 hours per gastrointestinal (GI) consult. A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned tomorrow if she remains stable.

The patient is tolerating clear liquids and will be advanced to full liquids. She has one 16-gauge IV and three 20-gauge peripheral IV lines. She is hemodynamically stable. The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis and has undergone Puestow surgery, but continues to experience chronic pain. There is no acute abdomen on examination and her CT scan shows no acute issues.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 62-86/41-46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis, anorexia, and bulimia gastritis. She presented with a likely subacute upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is currently stable with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 9.3 g/dL. She is being treated with an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip for 72 hours, which will be changed to intermittent IV. The plan is to keep the Hct at approximately 30% and recheck it every 12 hours. A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be performed to further evaluate the upper GI bleed. The patient is tolerating full liquids and will advance per GI plans.

The patient also has a history of chronic pancreatitis, for which she underwent a Puestow procedure. She reports chronic and stable pain, with no signs of acute abdomen on examination. A CT scan shows no acute findings. The patient is prescribed prn morphine for pain management, but efforts will be made to minimize its use. Enzyme replacement therapy will be restarted.

Additionally, the patient has psychosocial issues related to depression and anorexia. It is recommended that she resume her home regimen for these conditions.

The patient experienced hypotension, which was responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). Her blood"

   showed necrotic duodenal ulcer with only a slow ooze. No intervention
   taken given tenuous appearance. Patient received a total of 5 U PRBCs (
   3units given at OSH prior to transfer and 2u on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]). Hct
   has been stable since transfusion. Pt had transient episode of
   hypotension on 3/10am without evidence hct drop, otherwise
   hemodynamically stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis. She presented with melena, a severe hematocrit drop, and a necrotic duodenal ulcer seen on endoscopy. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells and has been hemodynamically stable since then. She also experienced a transient episode of hypotension but responded well to aggressive intravenous fluid administration. 

The patient's current condition includes ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, chronic pancreatitis, and potential sepsis. The assessment includes the following plans: 
- Follow-up with hospital 1 for Hct levels
- Test for H. Pylori antibody
- Continue proton pump inhibitor therapy
- Obtain informed consent and cross-match blood
- Insert large-bore peripheral intravenous lines
- Hold aspirin
- Follow-up with gastrointestinal recommendations

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's current condition involves ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further blood loss, hypotension, and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of low blood pressure, which can be caused by volume depletion, sepsis, or cardiogenic shock. This could result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient has low-grade fevers, and there is a concern for sepsis, especially considering the recent NG tube placement and potential"

   hypotension overnight that responded to IV boluses.
   #GI bleed:  Pt presented with melena, acute hct drop & EGD from [**3-24**]
   showed necrotic duodenal ulcer with only a slow ooze.  No intervention
   taken given tenuous appearance.  Patient received 5 U PRBCs.  Hct has
   been essentially stable since transfusion.  Tolerated full liquids, adv
   diet per GI.
   - f/u [**Hospital1 **] hcts
   - f/u H. Pylori antibody- still pending
   - a-line for BP monitoring, will need to d/c if called out to floor
   - IV PPI gtt, transition to PPI [**Hospital1 **] today

   # Hypotension: Pt with baseline low BPs & started on new narcotic
   regimen yesterday. BP dipped this am with MAPS in 55-60 range,
   responsive to aggressive IVF.  Pt was mentating well, making urine &
   showed e/o good distal perfusion despite MAPs in 55-60 range.
   Differential includes sepsis vs hypovolemia vs cardiogenic.  Will f/u
   cultures to rule out sepsis In setting of recent low grade fevers,
   however, WBC not elevated and pt afebrile.  Pt may have been volume
   depleted as UOP responded to IV boluses.  CXR shows volume overload vs
   possible infiltrate. Hct essentially stable, BP improved today but pt
   c/o worsened cough this am, started on 2L NC overnight after receiving
   aggressive IVF. CXR findings most likely due to volume.
   - monitor in ICU this morning, consider transfer to floor later today
   as suspect BP close to baseline.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis. She presented with melena, severe hct drop, and a necrotic duodenal ulcer seen on endoscopy. She received 5 units of packed red blood cells and her hemoglobin levels have been stable since the transfusion. The patient tolerated full liquids and advanced diet per GI consultation.

The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which responded to intravenous boluses. Her blood pressure dipped with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the range of 55-60, but she showed good distal perfusion and was alert and oriented. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock. Cultures were ordered to rule out sepsis, and the patient's urine output responded to IV boluses, indicating possible volume depletion. A chest X-ray showed volume overload or possible infiltrate.

The patient's cough worsened overnight, and she was started on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The chest X-ray findings are likely due to volume overload. The patient's blood, urine, and sputum cultures were ordered. The plan is to monitor her in the ICU this morning and consider transferring her to the floor later today if her blood pressure remains close to baseline.

The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis and a recent CT scan showed stable changes with no acute pancreatitis. She was started on O"
