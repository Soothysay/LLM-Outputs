","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman with hypertension, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with worsening shortness of breath and was found to have triple vessel coronary artery disease (3vCAD) and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). She is currently awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

Medical Complications:
1. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated at 1.6, which requires urgent reversal with Vitamin K before surgery. Further investigation into the etiology of the elevated INR is needed.
2. Chronic systolic heart failure (CHF): The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 40%, indicating reduced pumping ability of the heart. She also exhibits severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction. Optimization of hemodynamics has been done with diuretics, and a PA catheter is in place for tailored therapy.
3. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD and may require treatment with ipratropium inhaler and albuterol as needed.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is on metoprolol, nitroglycerin, and hydralazine for blood pressure control.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has low levels of HDL cholesterol and is currently on fibrate therapy. A low-dose stat"

   Assessment and Plan
   72F w HTN, HL, COPD, originally p/w worsening SOB, was found to have
   3vCAD and elevated PCWP, now awaiting CABG.
   # CORONARIES: 3vCAD w occluded LAD, stenotic LM, proximal RCA and PDA,
   evaluated by CT Surgery for CABG.
   - IABP in place 1:1
   - heparin gtt
   - ASA 325 daily
   - metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   - atorvastatin 20 daily
   - on schedule for CABG today
   # PUMP:  Likely chronic systolic CHF. EF 40%, evidence systolic and
   severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction on ECHO/cath. Not
   decompensated. Pt relatively asymptomatic with markedly elevated PCWP
   (~43).  Optimized hemodynamics prior to surgery w diuresis.
   - PA catheter in place for tailored therapy
   - ACEi on hold pre-surgery
   - Vasodilation with NTG
   # RHYTHM:  NSR. Monitor on tele
   - continue metoprolol
   # COPD
   -Standing ipratropium nebs
   -Prn albuterol nebs
   -IS at bedside
   # HTN:
   - metoprolol
   -NTG gtt
   -hydral for afterload reduction
   -holding home verapamil for now
   -hold ACEI in setting of dye load, cr 1.3 and pre-CABG as above.
   # Hyperlipidemia. Pt carries dx of elevated lipids, on recent PCP labs,
   LDL low at 62, low HDL 33.  Has been on fibrate therapy for ""years"" for
   unclear reasons.  In setting of low HDL, and for peri-operative med
   optimization will start low dose statin.
   -Atorvastatin 20mg daily
   -repeat lipids
   # Depression - Continue home dose fluoxetine, 20mg TID confirmed with
   pt and pharmacy.
   FEN:NPO except meds/sips for now. NPO after MN for surgery. Otherwise
   low sodium diet, fluid restricted.
   ACCESS: PIV's, PA catheter
   PROPHYLAXIS:  bowel regimen, on hep gtt

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 143/51 mmHg, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. Her temperature is within normal range at 36.7 degrees Celsius.

The physical examination reveals a supple neck with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 12 cm, no carotid bruits, and a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. The patient has an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in place, which is producing a loud systolic murmur and prominent S2 sound, loudest in the abdomen. No chest wall deformities or abnormal breath sounds are noted. 

The laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.3-9.3 thousand/mL, hemoglobin of 33.9-35.7%, platelet count of 135-136 thousand/mL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose of 101-119 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range. The PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, indicating a coagulation disorder that was reversed with vitamin K prior to surgery. 

The patient's medical plan includes the continuation of IABP, heparin infusion, aspirin, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and diuretics. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bleeding due to elevated PT/PTT/INR levels and heparin therapy.
2. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal function due to dehydration or medications.
3. Hypotension or arrhythmias during or after CABG surgery.
4. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening COPD.
5. Infection due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive lines or catheters.
6. Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
7. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters.
8. Stress-related mucosal damage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
10. Postoperative delirium or depression.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, coagulation profile, renal function, and fluid balance, as well as provide appropriate prophylaxis for potential complications."
