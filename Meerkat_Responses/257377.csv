   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo spanish speaking woman with h/o asthma, DM2, dyslipidemia, [**Hospital 5299**]
   transferred to MICU for respiratory distress and hyponatremia
   # Respiratory distress- Improved with multi-faceted therapies including
   steroids, ABx, diuretics, and nebulizers. Etiology may also be
   multi-faceted; worsening hypoxia when supine and improvement on Lasix
   may indicate cardiac contribution, with possible obstructive pulmonary
   processes She had negative flu test and is being optimally treated for
   asthma exacerbation. Also given dHF need to consider volume overload
   although exam and CXR and urine sodium of >40 do not suggest this.
   Acute PE on DDx, SQ heparin held on floor given thrombocytopenia. Plan
   as follows:
   - change to levofloxacin to cover for legionella
   - lasix 20mg IV now to determine if any improvement in respiratory
   status
   - will need intubation if no improvement with lasix given the asthma
   treatment is optimized and she will develop respiratory fatigue
   - check urine legionella
   - if has response to lasix then will need to workup cause of acute on
   chronic diastolic heart failure with repeat TTE, cardiac enzymes etc.
   .
   # Hyponatremia- urine osm >400 and urine Na>40 along with euvolemic
   exam suggest SIADH. She has prior sodium level low to mid 130s. Likely
   has underlying SIADH. Unclear data on whether severe asthma
   exacerbation can trigger worsening SIADH. She did hit her head and CTH
   negative for head bleed so unlikely this altered her axis. Of note she
   will receive lasix IV for respiratory status so need to closely follow
   sodium.
   - repeat STAT CHEM 7
   - trend sodium
   - if develops confusion and has worsening hyponatremia will need
   central access and hypertonic saline administration along with
   nephrology consultation
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- worked up as outpatient, discuss with hematology
   the BM bx results and ask whether SQ heparin contraindicated.
   - trend
   .
   # s/p fall- low threshold to repeat CTH if confusion in addition to
   checking sodium
   .
   # Diastolic heart failure
   - no clear evidence of acute decompensation but will trial IV lasix
   given respiratory status
   - good rate control
   .
   # HTN- hold atenolol for now
   .
   # DM- continue floor regimen
   .
   # Hypothyroid- cont synthroid

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old woman with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory distress and hyponatremia.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/58 mmHg to 132/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. Her general appearance is well-nourished and she is not in acute distress. 

The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities. Her cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and she has wheezes and rhonchi on lung auscultation. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 126 mEq/L, slightly elevated potassium levels at 5.2 mEq/L, and a blood glucose level of 242 mg/dL. Her white blood cell count is within normal limits, but she has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 41 K/u"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and chronic thrombocytopenia. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory distress and hyponatremia. The patient's respiratory distress has improved with multi-faceted therapies, including steroids, antibiotics, diuretics, and nebulizers. Her etiology of respiratory distress may be multi-faceted, with worsening hypoxia when supine and improvement on Lasix indicating a cardiac contribution in the setting of known mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). She also has chronic asthma, which may have a component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's hyponatremia is euvolemic and believed to be syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) of unclear etiology. It has improved with hypertonic saline infusion, which has been stopped. The patient has a history of falls, and her head imaging is negative for acute fractures. She also has hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and is being treated with FEN (likely referring to nothing by mouth status).

The patient's thrombocytopenia is chronic, and she is awaiting a formal bone marrow biopsy report. Her blood glucose levels are severely elevated, exacerbated by steroid use. She requires insulin therapy, specifically adding"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   79 yo spanish speaking woman with h/o asthma, DM2, dyslipidemia, [**Hospital 5299**]
   transferred to MICU for respiratory distress and hyponatremia
   .
   # Respiratory distress- the DDx includes asthma exacerbation for which
   the most likely trigger is viral URI, PNA less likely given chest
   radiograph. She had negative flu test and is being optimally treated
   for asthma exacerbation. Also given dHF need to consider volume
   overload although exam and CXR and urine sodium of >40 do not suggest
   this. Acute PE on DDx, SQ heparin held on floor given thrombocytopenia.
   Plan as follows:
   - change to levofloxacin to cover for legionella
   - lasix 20mg IV now to determine if any improvement in respiratory
   status
   - will need intubation if no improvement with lasix given the asthma
   treatment is optimized and she will develop respiratory fatigue
   - check urine legionella
   - if has response to lasix then will need to workup cause of acute on
   chronic diastolic heart failure with repeat TTE, cardiac enzymes etc.
   .
   # Hyponatremia- urine osm >400 and urine Na>40 along with euvolemic
   exam suggest SIADH. She has prior sodium level low to mid 130s. Likely
   has underlying SIADH. Unclear data on whether severe asthma
   exacerbation can trigger worsening SIADH. She did hit her head and CTH
   negative for head bleed so unlikely this altered her axis. Of note she
   will receive lasix IV for respiratory status so need to closely follow
   sodium.
   - repeat STAT CHEM 7
   - trend sodium
   - if develops confusion and has worsening hyponatremia will need
   central access and hypertonic saline administration along with
   nephrology consultation
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- worked up as outpatient, discuss with hematology
   the BM bx results and ask whether SQ heparin contraindicated.
   - trend
   .
   # s/p fall- low threshold to repeat CTH if confusion in addition to
   checking sodium
   .
   # Diastolic heart failure
   - no clear evidence of acute decompensation but will trial IV lasix
   given respiratory status
   - good rate control
   .
   # HTN- hold atenolol for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia. She was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress and hyponatremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/58 to 132/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild aortic and mitral regurgitation, and moderate cardiomegaly on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The differential diagnosis includes asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and volume overload. The patient is being treated for asthma exacerbation, and there are no signs of acute overhydration or pneumonia on the chest X-ray. However, acute PE should still be considered, especially given the negative flu test and the need for dHF. Intubation may be required if there is no improvement with lasix.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's urine osmolarity is greater than 400, and urine sodium is greater than 40, suggesting SIADH. The"

   exacerbation can trigger worsening SIADH. She did hit her head and CTH

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory distress and hyponatremia. The patient has been receiving optimal treatment for an asthma exacerbation, but her respiratory status has not improved. There are concerns about possible volume overload, acute pulmonary embolism (PE), and the need for intubation if there is no improvement. The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and her sodium levels need to be closely monitored. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and a history of falling, and she requires further evaluation for these issues. Additionally, the patient has diastolic heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and is being treated for an upper gastrointestinal bleed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may progress to respiratory failure if her asthma exacerbation does not improve with current treatment, and she may require intubation.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia could worsen, leading to severe symptoms or complications if her sodium levels drop significantly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may indicate an underlying condition that needs"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia. She was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress and hyponatremia. The respiratory distress has improved with multi-faceted therapies, including steroids, antibiotics, diuretics, and nebulizers. The etiology of the respiratory distress may be multi-faceted, possibly involving cardiac issues given the known mildly depressed ejection fraction. Chronic asthma could also contribute to a COPD component. The severe pulmonary embolism is unlikely due to echo findings.

Hyponatremia, which is euvolemic and believed to be SIADH of unclear etiology, has improved overnight with hypertonic saline infusion, now stopped. The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, awaiting formal bone marrow biopsy report. She experienced a fall but had negative head imaging for acute fractures.

The patient has hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She is being held on atenolol, Lantus, and synthroid respectively. The patient is NPO and has no intravenous fluids. Prophylaxis for pneumococcal infection is given. Peripheral intravenous lines are in place, and consideration is being made for a PICC line if needed. The patient's code status is full, discussed with the patient and her daughter. The patient's disposition is in the ICU.

   79 yo spanish speaking woman with h/o asthma, DM2, dyslipidemia, [**Hospital 5299**]
   transferred to MICU for respiratory distress and hyponatremia
   .
   # Respiratory distress- Respiratory status continues to improve,
   although still wheezy. Per patient and family, baseline physical
   activity significantly limited, [**2-2**] chronic dyspnea, and lungs may
   never sound totally clear. Has improved with steroids, ABx, diuretics,
   and nebulizers. Etiology may also be multi-faceted, although suspect
   significant cardiac component, given hypoxia when supine and
   improvement on Lasix. Also with chronic asthma/COPD
baseline pulmonary
   function and PFT
s unknown. Off ABx. Had negative flu test and is being
   optimally treated for asthma exacerbation.  Severe PE unlikely given
   Echo findings.
   - per Renal, minimizing further doses of furosemide, but will aim for
   goal fluid balance of even to (-500)
   - c/w nebs, PO prednisone
will likely require longer steroid taper,
   given baseline respiratory compromise
   - consider treating for afterload reduction, given likely cardiac
   etiology
   - Will obtain baseline blood gas
   - Started lisinopril yesterday, will convert to once-daily dosing today
   .
   # Hyponatremia- Resolved. Believed to be [**2-2**] SIADH of unclear etiology.
   Improved overnight with hypertonic saline infusion, now stopped.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **]- Creatinine stably elevated. In setting of medical diuresis and
   initiation of ACE inhibitor. Will avoid excessive diuresis, unless
   cardiopulmonary status worsens.
   - Monitor BUN/creatinine
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- Chronic, although significantly improved. BM biopsy
   report as above. Given temporal relationship to steroid dosing, will
   consider autoimmune etiology.
   - daily CBC
   .
   # s/p fall- Head imaging negative for acute fractures
   .
   # HTN- holding
   .
   # DM- Hyperglycemia better controlled with addition of lantus. In
   setting of steroids, will have to consider decreasing insulin regimen
   as prednisone tapered
   - lantus & sliding scale
   .
   # Hypothyroid- cont synthroid

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory distress and hyponatremia. The patient's respiratory status has improved with steroids, antibiotics, diuretics, and nebulizers. However, her lungs may never sound completely clear. The etiology of her respiratory distress is multifaceted, with a suspected significant cardiac component. 

The patient's hyponatremia resolved overnight with hypertonic saline infusion and has been stopped. The cause of the hyponatremia is unclear but may be due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

The patient's creatinine levels have stabilized and will be monitored closely. Thrombocytopenia is present but has significantly improved. A bone marrow biopsy report shows hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and an atypical lymphocytic infiltrate, which is likely reactive but raises the possibility of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

The patient's other medical conditions include a fall without acute fractures, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease. She is currently on multiple medications including lisinopril, prednisone, lantus, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition has improved, and they feel better. They have a history of severe COPD, cardiac disease, and hyperglycemia. They are receiving treatment with an ACE inhibitor, diuretic, and tapering prednisone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 142/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is well-nourished and appears comfortable without any signs of distress. Physical examination findings include ecchymosis on the right face, diffuse wheezing in the lungs, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and purposeful movement with normal muscle tone. Lab results show hyponatremia (low sodium), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's blood gases are within normal range. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor once stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which indicates a potential risk for further respiratory complications. Close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status are essential.
2. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient has a history of severe COPD, and acute exacerbations can occur due to various triggers such"
