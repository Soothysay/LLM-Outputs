   Chief Complaint:  Hypoxia
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 7316**] is a 39 yo female with h/o Bipolar and Schizoaffective
   disorder who presents from [**Hospital3 4144**] with hypoxia. Per
   report, pt had been having mild respiratory complaints recently. Mother
   notes that the patient complained of lip and eye swelling on Friday and
   was seen at [**Hospital **] hospital. She was cleared medically and then
   admitted to [**Hospital3 4144**] for benzo detox. At [**Hospital1 1595**], she was
   noted to have LE edema and hypoxia and so was transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**]
   ED. In the ED, her O2 sat was normal, workup was only notable for 3+ LE
   edema and elevated bicarb. When her mother saw her on the following
   day, she noted that the pt's ""body looked swollen"". On routine vitals
   earlier today she was found to have a RA sat in the mid-80s. On repeat
   check, her sat was 94%, but then dropped to the mid-80s again. EMS was
   called. On their arrival, once again her sat was in the mid 80s with a
   good tracing. She was placed on a non-rebreather mask and brought to
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   In the ED, initial vitals were: T 97.2, BP 117/74, HR 101, R 32, O2 sat
   89% on supplemental O2 (unclear how much). Exam was only notable for
   intermittent agitation, no respiratory distress, lungs clear, mild LE
   swelling. Pt was noted to desat to 70-80s on RA with purplish tint to
   lips and requiring 10L supplemental O2. ABG was 7.37/70/48 on RA with
   lactate 0.8. No leukocytosis. Negative serum tox. CXR was clear. CTA
   chest negative for PE. Patient was given neb with minimal effect. Also
   received solumedrol, ceftriaxone, motrin, risperdal and ativan. She was
   admitted to the MICU for further evaluation.
   On the floor, she has no complaints. She denies SOB, chest pain, chest
   tightness, cough. Repeat ABG on NRB was 7.31/75/126. When taken off of
   NRB, her O2 sats drifted to the low 80s and pt did complain of some
   SOB.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 39 year old female with schizoaffective
   and bipolar disorder who presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Pt with shunt physiology and question of pulmonary AVM on
   chest CT. Cannot rule out extrapulmonary shunt (e.g. intra-cardiac or
   hepato-pulmonary-- though no known cirrhosis). No fever, leukocytosis
   or infiltrate on imaging to suggest infectious etiology. CTA was
   negative for PE. No ischemic changes on EKG and CE neg x 1. No effusion
   or evidence of CHF. Could have diminished diffusion capacity however
   there is no evidence of fibrosis or interstitial edema on imaging.
   Likely not an acute process, however had documented normal O2 sat on
   [**4-8**].
   - supplemental O2 as needed, wean as tolerated
   - check TTE with bubble study to evaluate for possible intra or extra
   pulmonary shunt
   - check DLCO if able in ICU
   - check ESR for ?vasculitis
   - will obtain OSH records
   .
   # Hypercarbia: With elevated bicarb, this is likely chronic. Pt with
   diminished breath sounds and rapid respiratory rate leading to
   hypoventilation. With smoking history and paraseptal emphysema noted on
   CT, may have underlying undiagnosed COPD. Also on the differential
   would be respiratory muscle weakness.
   -check spirometry to evaluate for obstructive disease
   -albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -check MIP/MEP to evaluate respiratory motor function
   # Altered mental status: Unclear baseline. Likely delirium. Known
   history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder would give patient
   limited reserve in the setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and
   hospitalization in an unfamiliar setting. No other electrolyte
   abnormalities, no underlying infectious process.
   - hold benzo's and other psychoactive meds
   - consider head CT if she does not clear mentally
   .
   # Pediculosis:  Requires derm consult to confirm.  Can treat with
   lindane, permethrin, or a variety of other shampoos and techniques.
   - Consult Derm
   - Lidane/permetrhin, ask pharmacy for suggestion

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7316**], a 39-year-old female with a history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder, presents with hypoxia. She has been experiencing mild respiratory complaints recently and was admitted to the MICU for further evaluation. The patient's oxygen saturation has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from the mid-80s to 94% on a non-rebreather mask. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 126, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 126. The patient has no acute distress, clear lungs, and mild lower extremity edema. She is currently receiving supplemental oxygen and will be evaluated for possible intra or extrapulmonary shunt with a TTE with bubble study. Other potential causes for her hypoxia and hypercarbia include chronic respiratory disease, such as COPD or respiratory muscle weakness. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to delirium, possibly exacerbated by her psychiatric history and hospitalization in an unfamiliar setting. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms."

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder who presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia. She has been experiencing mild respiratory complaints recently and was seen at another hospital for lip and eye swelling. She was cleared medically and admitted to the current hospital for benzo detox. At the previous hospital, she was noted to have lower extremity edema and hypoxia, leading to her transfer to the emergency department of the current hospital. In the ED, her O2 saturation was normal, but she had 3+ LE edema and elevated bicarbonate levels. Upon admission to the ICU, she was placed on a non-rebreather mask and her O2 saturation dropped to the mid-80s. She received nebulizers with minimal effect and was given solumedrol, ceftriaxone, motrin, risperdal, and ativan. She denies any complaints and has no difficulty breathing. However, her O2 saturation drifts to the low 80s when taken off the NRB, and she complains of some shortness of breath. Her current vital signs are stable, and she is on supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes or rales, and trace bilateral LE edema. Neurological examination shows difficulty with finger-to-nose and rapid alternating hand movements with the left arm, but no difficulty on the right side. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 year old female with schizoaffective and bipolar disorder
   who presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Pt with shunt physiology and question of pulmonary AVM on
   chest CT. Cannot rule out extrapulmonary shunt (e.g. intra-cardiac or
   hepato-pulmonary-- though no known cirrhosis). No fever, leukocytosis
   or infiltrate on imaging to suggest infectious etiology. CTA was
   negative for PE. No ischemic changes on EKG and CE neg x 1. No effusion
   or evidence of CHF. Could have diminished diffusion capacity however
   there is no evidence of fibrosis or interstitial edema on imaging.
   Likely not an acute process, however had documented normal O2 sat on
   [**4-8**]. Bubble study negative for intra or extra pulmonary shunt. ESR of
   2, unlikely vasculitis.
   - supplemental O2 as needed, wean as tolerated
   - check DLCO if able in ICU
   .
   # Hypercarbia: With elevated bicarb, this is likely chronic. Pt with
   diminished breath sounds and rapid respiratory rate leading to
   hypoventilation. With smoking history and paraseptal emphysema noted on
   CT, may have underlying undiagnosed COPD. Also on the differential
   would be respiratory muscle weakness.
   -check spirometry to evaluate for obstructive disease
   -albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -check MIP/MEP to evaluate respiratory motor function
   # Altered mental status: Unclear baseline. Likely delirium. Known
   history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder would give patient
   limited reserve in the setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and
   hospitalization in an unfamiliar setting. No other electrolyte
   abnormalities, no underlying infectious process.  Restarted outpatient
   psychiatric medications yesterday.
   - consider head CT if she does not clear mentally
   .
   # Pediculosis:  Dermatology consulted. Recommended shampoos x2 [**4-12**]
   along with ivermectin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old female with schizoaffective and bipolar disorder who presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia. The patient has a history of smoking and shows signs of diminished breath sounds, rapid respiratory rate, and paraseptal emphysema on CT scan. This may indicate underlying undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or respiratory muscle weakness. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to delirium, and she has a limited baseline due to her psychiatric history. No other significant medical history or abnormalities were noted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood. This can be caused by shunt physiology, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or extrapulmonary shunt (such as intra-cardiac or hepato-pulmonary). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Hypercarbia: The patient has high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This is likely chronic and may be due to hypoventilation caused by respiratory muscle weakness or undiagnosed COPD. Additional testing, such as spirometry and measurement of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), is recommended to evaluate for obstructive disease.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental state is unclear, and she may be experiencing delirium"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 year old female with schizoaffective and bipolar disorder
   who presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Pt with shunt physiology and question of pulmonary AVM on
   chest CT. Cannot rule out extrapulmonary shunt (e.g. intra-cardiac or
   hepato-pulmonary-- though no known cirrhosis). No fever, leukocytosis
   or infiltrate on imaging to suggest infectious etiology. CTA was
   negative for PE. No ischemic changes on EKG and CE neg x 1. No effusion
   or evidence of CHF. Could have diminished diffusion capacity however
   there is no evidence of fibrosis or interstitial edema on imaging.
   Likely not an acute process, however had documented normal O2 sat on
   [**4-8**]. Bubble study negative for intra or extra pulmonary shunt. ESR of
   2, unlikely vasculitis.
   - supplemental O2 as needed, wean as tolerated
   - check DLCO if able in ICU
   .
   # Hypercarbia: With elevated bicarb, this is likely chronic. Pt with
   diminished breath sounds and rapid respiratory rate leading to
   hypoventilation. With smoking history and paraseptal emphysema noted on
   CT, may have underlying undiagnosed COPD. Also on the differential
   would be respiratory muscle weakness.
   -check spirometry to evaluate for obstructive disease
   -albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -check MIP/MEP to evaluate respiratory motor function
   # Altered mental status: Unclear baseline. Likely delirium. Known
   history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder would give patient
   limited reserve in the setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and
   hospitalization in an unfamiliar setting. No other electrolyte
   abnormalities, no underlying infectious process.  Restarted outpatient
   psychiatric medications yesterday.
   - consider head CT if she does not clear mentally
   .
   # Pediculosis:  Dermatology consulted. Recommended shampoos x2 [**4-12**]
   along with ivermectin.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes prn, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, bowel regimen

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective and bipolar disorder.
- She presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia, indicating low oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide levels in the blood.
- The patient has a shunt physiology and there is a question of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) on chest CT.
- No fever, leukocytosis, or infiltrate on imaging suggests that an infectious etiology is unlikely.
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE).
- There are no ischemic changes on EKG and chest X-ray (CE) is negative.
- There is no evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF).
- Diminished breath sounds bilaterally may indicate hypoventilation.
- The patient has a smoking history and paraseptal emphysema noted on CT, which may suggest underlying undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Other potential causes for the altered mental status include delirium and limited reserve due to hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hospitalization in an unfamiliar setting.
- The patient also has pediculosis, which is being treated with dermatology consultation and recommended shampoos along with ivermectin.
- The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on regular diet.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 year old female with schizoaffective and bipolar disorder
   who presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Pt with shunt physiology and question of pulmonary AVM on
   chest CT. Cannot rule out extrapulmonary shunt (e.g. intra-cardiac or
   hepato-pulmonary-- though no known cirrhosis). No fever, leukocytosis
   or infiltrate on imaging to suggest infectious etiology. CTA was
   negative for PE. No ischemic changes on EKG and CE neg x 1. No effusion
   or evidence of CHF. Could have diminished diffusion capacity however
   there is no evidence of fibrosis or interstitial edema on imaging.
   Likely not an acute process, however had documented normal O2 sat on
   [**4-8**]. Bubble study negative for intra or extra pulmonary shunt. ESR of
   2, unlikely vasculitis.
   - supplemental O2 as needed, wean as tolerated
   - check DLCO if able in ICU
   .
   # Hypercarbia: With elevated bicarb, this is likely chronic. Pt with
   diminished breath sounds and rapid respiratory rate leading to
   hypoventilation. With smoking history and paraseptal emphysema noted on
   CT, may have underlying undiagnosed COPD. Also on the differential
   would be respiratory muscle weakness.
   -check spirometry to evaluate for obstructive disease
   -albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -check MIP/MEP to evaluate respiratory motor function
   # Altered mental status: Unclear baseline. Likely delirium. Known
   history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder would give patient
   limited reserve in the setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and
   hospitalization in an unfamiliar setting. No other electrolyte
   abnormalities, no underlying infectious process.  Restarted outpatient
   psychiatric medications yesterday.
   - consider head CT if she does not clear mentally
   .
   # Pediculosis:  Dermatology consulted. Recommended shampoos x2 [**4-12**]
   along with ivermectin.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes prn, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 39-year-old female with schizoaffective and bipolar disorder.
- She presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia, which are conditions characterized by low oxygen levels and increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood.
- Possible causes of hypoxia include shunt physiology, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and extrapulmonary shunt.
- The patient's PFT results are equivocal, and a lung scan is pending to further evaluate the cause of hypoxia.
- Hypercarbia is likely chronic, possibly due to hypoventilation caused by diminished breath sounds and rapid respiratory rate. The patient has a history of smoking and paraseptal emphysema on CT, which may indicate underlying undiagnosed COPD.
- The patient also has altered mental status, likely delirium, and a history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder. This limited reserve in the setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hospitalization in an unfamiliar setting.
- The patient has pediculosis, for which dermatology recommended shampoos and ivermectin treatment.
- The patient's vital signs, lab results, and flow sheet data are provided in the note.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 39 year old female with schizoaffective and bipolar disorder
   who presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Pt with shunt physiology and question of pulmonary AVM on
   chest CT. PFT
s equivacol, awaiting Lung Scan.  Cannot rule out
   extrapulmonary shunt (e.g. intra-cardiac or hepato-pulmonary-- though
   no known cirrhosis). No fever, leukocytosis or infiltrate on imaging to
   suggest infectious etiology. CTA was negative for PE. No ischemic
   changes on EKG and CE neg x 1. No effusion or evidence of CHF. Could
   have diminished diffusion capacity however there is no evidence of
   fibrosis or interstitial edema on imaging. Likely not an acute process,
   however had documented normal O2 sat on [**4-8**]. Bubble study negative for
   intra or extra pulmonary shunt. ESR of 2, unlikely vasculitis.
   - supplemental O2 as needed, wean as tolerated
   - Lung Scan today.
   # Hypercarbia: chronic. Pt with diminished breath sounds and rapid
   respiratory rate leading to hypoventilation. With smoking history and
   paraseptal emphysema noted on CT, may have underlying undiagnosed COPD.
   Also on the differential would be respiratory muscle weakness.

   # Altered mental status: Unclear baseline. Likely delirium. Known
   history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder would give patient
   limited reserve in the setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and
   hospitalization in an unfamiliar setting. No other electrolyte
   abnormalities, no underlying infectious process.  Restarted outpatient
   psychiatric medications, no additional psych recs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with schizoaffective and bipolar disorder. She presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia. The hypoxia is due to shunt physiology and a possible pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) on chest CT. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are equivocal, and a lung scan is awaiting. Other potential causes of hypoxia, such as an infectious etiology or pulmonary embolism, have been ruled out. The patient also has hypercarbia, which is chronic and may be related to underlying undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or respiratory muscle weakness. Altered mental status is likely due to delirium, exacerbated by hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hospitalization. The patient has a history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder, and restarted outpatient psychiatric medications. Dermatology consultation recommended treatment for pediculosis with shampoos and ivermectin. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and she requires supplemental oxygen as needed. Further evaluation of PFTs and lung scan results is pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of psychiatric disorders (schizoaffective and bipolar disorder) due to altered mental status and hospitalization.
2. Respiratory failure and worsening hypoxia if oxygenation cannot be adequately maintained.
3. Development of respiratory muscle weakness or exacerb"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 year old female with schizoaffective and bipolar disorder who
   presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Pt originally with shunt physiology and question of
   pulmonary AVM on chest CT. Cannot rule out extrapulmonary shunt (e.g.
   intra-cardiac or hepato-pulmonary-- though no known cirrhosis). No
   fever, leukocytosis or infiltrate on imaging to suggest infectious
   etiology. CTA was negative for PE. No ischemic changes on EKG and CE
   neg. No effusion or evidence of CHF. Could have diminished diffusion
   capacity however there is no evidence of fibrosis or interstitial edema
   on imaging. Likely not an acute process, however had documented normal
   O2 sat on [**4-8**]. As above, echo with bubble study did not find shunt,
   perfusion scan did not find shunt. Pft's showing slight obstructive
   picture. ESR 2.
   -will continue to support with supplemental 02.
   -will consider possible bypap for hypercarbia
   -abg this AM
   -encourage smoking cessation.
   .
   # Hypercarbia: With elevated bicarb,likely chronic. Pt with diminished
   breath sounds and rapid respiratory rate leading to hypoventilation.
   With smoking history and paraseptal emphysema noted on CT, may have
   underlying undiagnosed COPD. Also on the differential would be
   respiratory muscle weakness.
   -obstructive dx seen in PFTs
   -albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -check MIP/MEP to evaluate respiratory motor function
   .
   # Altered mental status: Unclear baseline. Known history of bipolar and
   schizoaffective disorder would give patient limited reserve in the
   setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hospitalization in an unfamiliar
   setting. No other electrolyte abnormalities, no underlying infectious
   process.
   - judicious use of benzo's and other psychoactive meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and hypercarbia. The patient's medical history includes bipolar/schizoaffective disorder, chronic hypercarbia with unclear etiology, and a history of heavy smoking. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/54 mmHg to 96/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on a venti mask. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and no cyanosis or muscle wasting. Neurological assessment shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. Laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, glucose, and electrolytes. However, there are slightly elevated levels of potassium and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient has received treatment for head lice and is being managed for agitation related to bipolar/schizoaffective disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic hypercarbia indicates a long-standing issue with elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and potentially result in"
