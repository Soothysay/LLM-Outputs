","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of severe persistent asthma and IV drug use, presenting with sepsis, a thumb abscess, and left knee septic arthritis. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics and fluids, and her lactate levels have returned to normal. She is currently on various medications, including vancomycin, ampicillin/gentamicin, lorazepam, hydromorphone, diazepam, haloperidol, and omeprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains agitated and delusional. She has a fever of 103 degrees and her white blood cell count is elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis indicates a systemic infection that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

2. Thumb Abscess: The patient has a thumb abscess that requires appropriate drainage and treatment to prevent further complications such as spread of infection.

3. Septic Arthritis of the Left Knee: The patient's left knee joint is infected, which can lead to joint damage and dysfunction if not properly managed with drainage and antibiotic therapy.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated AST levels, which may indicate liver involvement due to sepsis or a viral hepatitis infection. Monitoring liver function and considering further investigations for viral hepatitis is recommended.

5. Acute Respiratory Failure:"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 980] is a 25-year-old female with severe persistent asthma, who recently underwent bilateral knee replacement for osteonecrosis. She presented with sepsis secondary to a thumb abscess and left knee septic arthritis, likely resulting from intravenous drug use (IVDU). She received 6 liters of fluid resuscitation in the emergency department (ED) and had a central venous line placed. Her lactate levels are now back to normal. The plan includes checking central venous pressure (CVP), pulling back the central venous line 7 cm, administering vancomycin and cefepime as per infectious disease (ID) consultation, and conducting a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in the morning to evaluate for endocarditis. Additionally, the patient has a history of long-term steroid use, so her cortisol levels will be checked in the morning.

The patient also has left knee septic arthritis following knee replacement surgery, which was likely seeded by IVDU and bacteremia. Cultures of the left knee fluid will be followed up, and an orthopedic consultation will be sought for surgical washout. The thumb abscess was surgically drained in the ED with packing, and a hand surgery consultation will be obtained. There is also evidence of transaminitis, possibly due to sepsis and shock liver or viral hepatitis. Trends in liver function tests (LFTs) will be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old woman with a history of bilateral knee replacements for osteonecrosis secondary to chronic steroid use. She presents with fever, left knee swelling, pain, and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including sepsis without organ dysfunction due to group A streptococci bacteremia, left knee prosthetic joint infection, left thumb abscess, transaminitis, coagulopathy, asthma exacerbation, delirium/confusion, acute renal failure, and possible endocarditis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Progression of sepsis to septic shock: The patient's current condition of sepsis without organ dysfunction may progress to septic shock if not promptly managed.
2. Spread of infection: The left knee prosthetic joint infection and left thumb abscess indicate a potential spread of infection to other parts of the body.
3. Complications from surgery: If the patient undergoes further orthopedic procedures for the left knee, there is a risk of surgical complications such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to anesthesia.
4. Hepatitis flare-up: The elevated liver enzymes suggest a potential flare-up of hepatitis, which can lead to liver dysfunction.
5. Coagulopathy exacerbation: The patient's elevated INR indicates a coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old woman with a history of bilateral knee replacements due to osteonecrosis secondary to chronic steroid use. She presents with fever, left knee swelling, pain, and hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU and is experiencing multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a confirmed Group A streptococci bacteremia, which indicates a systemic infection. This could lead to sepsis, potentially progressing to septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Prosthetic Joint Infection: The patient's left knee prosthesis is suspected to have an infection. If left untreated, this can result in the spread of infection, worsening of symptoms, and potential need for surgical intervention.
3. Thumb Abscess: The patient has a left thumb abscess that requires drainage. If not appropriately managed, it can lead to the spread of infection to other areas or deeper tissues.
4. Transaminitis: The patient is experiencing elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver inflammation. This condition, known as transaminitis, needs to be closely monitored and treated to prevent further liver damage.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, suggesting a bleeding tendency. This can be exacerbated by poor oral intake, antibiotics, and underlying Hepatitis C infection. Close monitoring of coagulation status is essential to prevent bleeding complications.

","Summary:
Ms [Known Lastname 980] is a 25-year-old female with a history of severe persistent asthma and IV drug use, presenting with sepsis, thumb abscess, and left knee septic arthritis. She received 6 liters of fluid resuscitation in the ED and had central venous line placement. Her lactate level is normal. The patient has been diagnosed with group A streptococcus infection in both the thumb abscess and left knee joint fluid cultures. She also has a history of bilateral knee replacement for osteonecrosis. 

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, likely due to the thumb abscess and left knee septic arthritis. Immediate treatment is required to address the infection.
2. Thumb Abscess: The patient has a confirmed thumb abscess, which was drained in the ED. Hand surgery consultation is needed for further evaluation and management.
3. Left Knee Septic Arthritis: The patient has septic arthritis in her left knee, with joint fluid growing group A streptococcus. Orthopedic consultation is required, and a washout procedure may be necessary.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated AST levels, possibly due to sepsis or viral hepatitis. Liver function tests should be trended, and hepatitis panel should be done considering her history of HCV and active IV drug use.
5. Nongap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old woman with a history of asthma, bilateral knee replacements, septic arthritis, and a thumb laceration/abscess. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure and septic arthritis. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, septic arthritis with prosthetic joint, thumb abscess, endocarditis, opiate withdrawal, and hepatitis C. She is receiving various medications and treatments for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to the patient's asthma and current mechanical ventilation. The presence of septic arthritis with a prosthetic joint increases the risk of infection spreading to other areas of the body. Additionally, the patient's thumb abscess and endocarditis may lead to further complications if not properly managed.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple ongoing medical issues requiring close monitoring and appropriate management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 980] is a 25-year-old female with a history of severe persistent asthma and IV drug use, presenting with sepsis, a thumb abscess, and left knee septic arthritis. She has been admitted to the ICU and has received aggressive fluid resuscitation. Cultures from the thumb abscess and left knee fluid have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Blood cultures have shown group A streptococcus. Ms. [Known Lastname 980] has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, gentamicin, clindamycin, and penicillin G. She has also undergone surgical drainage of the left knee joint and thumb abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Ms. [Known Lastname 980] presented with sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial to identify any deterioration in her condition.

2. Thumb Abscess: The thumb abscess requires ongoing wound care and may necessitate further surgical intervention. Regular assessment of the wound's progress and appropriate management are essential to prevent complications such as recurrent infections or spread of infection.

3. Left Knee Septic Arthritis: The left knee joint needs to be closely monitored for signs of persistent infection or worsening arthritis. Surgical washout and debridement may be necessary to address the infection and preserve joint"

   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient is presenting with signs of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. She also has a history of septic arthritis in her left knee and a thumb abscess, which are likely sources of infection. The blood cultures showing group A strep suggest a possible bacterial infection.

2. Septic Arthritis: The patient's left knee joint fluid culture grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection in the joint. This condition may require surgical intervention for drainage and washout.

3. Thumb Abscess: The patient has a thumb abscess that has been incised and drained. It is likely related to her history of intravenous drug use. The wound care and potential hand surgery consult will be important in managing this condition.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated AST levels, which may be due to sepsis or liver shock. Other possibilities include viral hepatitis, given her reported history of hepatitis C infection.

5. Nongap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's acid-base status shows a nongap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to fluid resuscitation in the emergency department.

6. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.7 to 1.1,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of severe persistent asthma and IV drug use, who presented with sepsis, a thumb abscess, and left knee septic arthritis. The patient has been diagnosed with group A streptococcus infection in various cultures. She underwent surgical washout of the left knee and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including penicillin G and clindamycin, and further evaluation for endocarditis is planned with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Thumb Abscess: The patient has a thumb abscess that requires appropriate wound care and may require surgical intervention.
3. Septic Arthritis of the Left Knee: The patient has septic arthritis of the left knee, which requires surgical management and may result in joint destruction if not treated effectively.
4. Endocarditis: Given the positive cultures for group A streptococcus and the presence of a mobile echodensity on the mitral valve seen in a previous echocardiogram, there is a concern for endocarditis. A TEE is planned to further evaluate this possibility.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Lastname 980**], a 25-year-old female with a history of severe persistent asthma and intravenous drug use (IVDU), presents with sepsis, thumb abscess, and left knee septic arthritis. She underwent bilateral knee replacement for osteonecrosis and is now in the ICU. The patient's current condition includes methemoglobinemia, respiratory distress requiring intubation, liver transaminitis, and possible HCV infection. There is also a mention of severe persistent asthma, drug abuse/withdrawal, and ongoing management for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently dealing with sepsis, likely due to a thumb abscess and left knee septic arthritis, which may be related to her IVDU. Continuous monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Methemoglobinemia: The patient experienced methemoglobinemia, which has been resolved with methylene blue. Close monitoring of ABG and O2 sats is crucial to prevent recurrence.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is currently unstable, requiring intubation. After weaning off pressors, extubation can be considered, and Haldol can be used for agitation.
4. Septic Arthritis: The left knee septic arthritis requires ongoing management, including follow-up cultures of knee fluid and adherence to orthopedic recommendations.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 980], a 25-year-old female with severe persistent asthma and IV drug use, presented with sepsis, likely secondary to a thumb abscess and left knee septic arthritis. She underwent bilateral knee replacement surgery for osteonecrosis and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple comorbidities including drug abuse/withdrawal, transaminitis, and a history of HCV infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently on pressors and has been diagnosed with sepsis. It is important to closely monitor her hemodynamic status and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Thumb Abscess: The patient has a thumb abscess that likely originated from IV drug use. She requires ongoing wound care and follow-up with hand surgery recommendations.
3. Left Knee Septic Arthritis: The patient had a left knee septic arthritis, which required surgical washout. She needs to follow up with orthopedic recommendations and culture of left knee fluid.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient has tested positive for hepatitis C. Further evaluation, including viral load and liver culture, is necessary. Limiting Tylenol intake to 2g per 24 hours is advised due to potential liver dysfunction.
5. Asthma: The patient has severe persistent asthma. Once necessary procedures are completed, she should be extubated and continue with Albuterol, Ipratropium, and Fl"

   24 Hour Events:
   - pt was given hurricaine spray during PEE, 20min later became
   cyanotic. ABG with 29% methemoglobin, pt was given methylene blue.
   cyanosis quickly resolved. Repeat ABG showed 13% methemoglobin
   -->5.5-->1-->
   - Hct went down from 27.9 to 24.9, got hemolysis labs, no hemolysis,
   repeat hct 25.4
   - stat CXR was ordered during cyanosis.
   - TEE showed no vegetations
   - brain MRI was canceled given methemoglobinemia and neg TEE
   - ortho recs: continue drain, dressing change tomorrow, WBAT once
   ambulatory. and will contact outpatient ortho from [**Hospital1 **]
   - ID recs: continue current abx regimen, consider IVIG if worsening
   hemodynamic status [**2-26**] sepsis
   - hand recs: continue abx
   - psych: would continue to use fentanyl and midazolam for sedation
   while intubated; once extubated use Haldol (rather than benzos) for
   agitation and continue monitoring for QT prolongation
   - allergy recordes and discharge summary from [**Hospital **] hospital were
   requested

","The patient is a 25-year-old female with severe persistent asthma and IV drug use, presenting with sepsis, thumb abscess, and left knee septic arthritis. She has undergone bilateral knee replacement for osteonecrosis and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's recent events include experiencing cyanosis after being given Hurricane spray during PEE, which resolved quickly with methylene blue administration. Her Hct levels decreased from 27.9 to 24.9, but repeated measurements showed no hemolysis. A stat CXR was ordered during cyanosis, and a TEE showed no vegetations. Brain MRI was canceled due to methemoglobinemia and negative TEE results. Ortho recommendations include continuing drain, dressing change tomorrow, and WBAT once ambulatory. ID recommendations involve continuing the current antibiotic regimen and considering IVIG if the patient's hemodynamic status worsens. Hand recs suggest continuing abx, and psych recommendations include using Haldol for agitation instead of benzos.

The patient has a history of severe persistent asthma and IV drug use. She is currently on multiple pressors and has a central line, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place. She is NPO and receiving IV antibiotics. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated WBC count, decreased Hct levels, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The TEE showed normal left ventricular systolic function, no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ov"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]):  Received fentanyl for
   dressing change of knee this morning.  A bit more sedated.  Will wean
   sedation, wean to PSV.  Lungs sound clear on exam.  Stable for
   extubation later today once more awake.
 ASTHMA:  No wheezing on exam. Continue current inhalers.
 ANEMIA:  Stable hct, no evidnece of hemolysis on labs.
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION: Haldol as per psychiatry.  Will need dose prior
   to anticipated extubation later today.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION:  Still requiring low dose levo.
   Trying to wean with goal for MAP 55.
 METHEMAGLOBINEMIA:  In setting of receiving Hurricane spray for TEE
   yesterday - resolved after single dose 1 mg/kg methylene blue.
 SEPTIC ARTHRITIS/PROSTHETIC LEFT KNEE:  Drain removed, dressing
   changed per ortho.  Continues PCN and clinda.  Suspicion for toxic
   shock syndrome is low. Will discuss stopping clinda  with ID.
   Surveillance cultures negative to date.  TEE shows no evidence of
   vegetation of PFO.
 THUMB LACERATION/ABSCESS:  Need to contact hand service regarding
   frequency of dressing changes.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical conditions that require close monitoring and management. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation to support breathing due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.

2. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has sepsis, which is a serious infection causing systemic inflammation. There is a risk of septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

3. Septic Arthritis/Prosthetic Left Knee: The patient has septic arthritis in the left knee, which is a joint infection. There is a risk of persistent infection, prosthetic joint infection, and spread of infection to other parts of the body.

4. Methemoglobinemia: The patient developed methemoglobinemia after receiving Hurricane spray during a TEE procedure. There is a risk of recurrence if exposed to oxidizing agents.

5. Thumb Laceration/Abscess: The patient has a thumb laceration with an abscess. There is a risk of infection spreading and potential need for surgical intervention.

6. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion. There is a risk of worsening cognitive function and potential need for psychiatric intervention.

7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to chronic disease or blood loss."

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 980] is a 25-year-old female with a history of severe persistent asthma and IV drug use. She presented with sepsis due to a thumb abscess and left knee septic arthritis. She also has a positive hepatitis C result. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, methemoglobinemia, respiratory status post-extubation, left knee septic arthritis, thumb abscess, transaminitis, severe persistent asthma, and drug abuse/withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis caused by a thumb abscess and left knee septic arthritis. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of sepsis if the infection is not adequately controlled.

2. Methemoglobinemia: The patient experienced methemoglobinemia after using a hurricane spray during a TEE procedure. This condition can cause tissue hypoxia and may require prompt treatment with methylene blue.

3. Respiratory Status: Although the patient has been successfully extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on RA (respiratory assistance) support.

4. Left Knee Septic Arthritis: The patient has left knee septic arthritis, which may require further surgical intervention or washout. There is a risk of joint damage or recurrent infection if not appropriately managed.

","Summary:
Ms. [Last Name] is a 25-year-old female with a history of severe persistent asthma and intravenous drug use. She presented with sepsis due to a thumb abscess and left knee septic arthritis, likely secondary to intravenous drug use. She underwent bilateral knee replacement surgery for osteonecrosis and developed an infection. She also had a recent dental procedure. She was admitted to the ICU and received treatment for sepsis, including antibiotics and surgical washout of the left knee joint. She was extubated successfully yesterday and is currently stable. She has a history of drug abuse/withdrawal and hepatitis C. She is also being treated for methemoglobinemia, which has resolved after methylene blue treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis due to a thumb abscess and left knee septic arthritis. She required aggressive treatment including antibiotics and surgical intervention. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Methemoglobinemia: The patient experienced methemoglobinemia after using a hurricane spray during a procedure. She received methylene blue treatment, which resolved the condition. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and signs of cyanosis is important to detect any recurrence.
3. Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of hepatitis C, which can lead to liver complications such as cirrhosis or liver failure. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and viral load is necessary to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of severe persistent asthma and intravenous drug use, presenting with sepsis due to a thumb abscess and left knee septic arthritis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various interventions and treatments.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 100/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics for the suspected Group A Strep infection, including Penicillin and Clindamycin. The patient's blood cultures and cultures from the thumb and left knee have confirmed the presence of Group A Strep.

The patient has been weaned off pressors and successfully extubated. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.43, pCO2 34, pO2 67, and HCO3 23, indicating a normal acid-base balance.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The liver function tests reveal elevated AST levels, but the trend is improving. The patient's blood work also shows positive results for Hepatitis C virus.

The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but the physician plans to wean off oxygen and continue monitoring ABG and O2"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of asthma and intravenous drug abuse. She was admitted with septic arthritis caused by Group A Strep and persistent bacteremia. The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) without endocarditis and experienced methemoglobinemia during the procedure. She has now successfully been extubated and her pressors have been weaned off.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had acute respiratory failure but has improved with successful extubation. Mild bilateral infiltrates are still present, and further monitoring is required. O2 therapy may be needed, and the patient should be encouraged to ambulate if possible.

2. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, and her respiratory status should be monitored closely. Adjustments to her asthma medications, such as Advair, Albuterol, Atrovent, and Flovent, may be necessary.

3. Delirium/Confusion: Although the patient's mental status has improved, persistent confusion is noted. Close monitoring is essential, and withdrawal symptoms should be assessed, although the patient denies ethanol use.

4. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient is being treated for possible toxic shock syndrome and Group A Strep septic arthritis. Antibiotics have been started, and the infected areas have been drained. The patient will require ongoing antibiotic"
