   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: No signs of sepsis on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 5**] as pt was normotensive.  Likely acquired from urine source as pt
   has positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although
   pt has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Lactate is normal. Overnight, patient became febrile and hypotensive
   consistent with recurrent sepsis. WBC increased from 17 to 44
   overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Ceftaz per ID recommendations
   - Continue Gent until cultures clear
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs
   - Consider repeat spinal imaging
   - US pacer/AICD pocket
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - Remove HD line today by IR
 culture tip
   - Remove other lines and plan for line holiday until cx clear
 culture
   tip
   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff (1^st sample pending)
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. History of Hypotension: differential includes sepsis given
   bactermia, and pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday.
   However, given that this only occurred with dialysis, it may be due to
   hypovolemia.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or
   ECG changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in
   the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   concerning for contined sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday for
   bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - removal of HD line by IR today
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and gram-positive bacteremia associated with hypotension. 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient has signs of sepsis, including fever and hypotension. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was initially cultured from blood and urine samples. The patient is already on ceftazidime, but recurrent sepsis occurred overnight. ID consult is recommended, and the patient should continue with the current antibiotic regimen as advised by the ID team.

2. GPCs in blood: Gram-positive cocci (GPC) were also detected in the blood cultures, but it is uncertain if this is a contaminant or true bacteremia. The patient is currently on vancomycin dosed per HD, and blood cultures should be redrawn for further evaluation.

3. History of Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension during dialysis, which may be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. Pressors were started, but the patient's blood pressure remained in the 70s overnight. Monitoring of blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Lactate is
   normal WBC increased from 17 to 44 overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but
   no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Ceftaz, vanco per ID recommendations
   - Continue Gent until cultures clear
   - Antibiotic dosing: vanco with dialysis; ceftaz usually dosed with
   dialysis but patient will be on HD holiday; will discuss dosing plan
   with ID and pharmacy (may change to [**Last Name (un) **]; would need to determine [**Last Name (un) **]
   sensitivities from micro)
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs to rule out other collections
   - Consider repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain,
   bacteremia
   - US pacer/AICD pocket
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - Removed HD line [**4-23**] by IR
 tip culture pending
   - Plan to maintain femoral line for pressors/abx for now; remove EJ
   line; plan for line holiday until cx clear for 24 hours (culture tips)
   - Attempt to place peripheral line earlier rather than later as patient
   will become more edematous with time
   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff (1^st sample pending)
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   now on levophed. Differential includes sepsis given bactermia vs
   hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely
   given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although echo did show new wall
   motion abnormalities in the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient
   developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on
   Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be secondary to hypovolemia,
   but given patient also febrile and episode several hours post-dialysis
   concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.

The patient's current condition includes sepsis/pseudomonas bacteremia, possible urinary tract infection (UTI) source, and line infection. His white blood cell count has increased from 17 to 44 overnight. He is febrile and hypotensive, requiring norepinephrine infusion. The patient also has a murmur, but an echocardiogram did not show vegetations, reducing concern for endocarditis. He has been on ceftazidime for two days, and vancomycin has been added per ID recommendations.

The patient's plan includes continuing ceftazidime, vancomycin, and gentamicin until cultures clear. Antibiotic dosing will be discussed with the ID and pharmacy, considering potential changes based on sensitivities. The patient is also on holiday from HD, and the femoral line will be maintained for pressors/antibiotics. Repeat blood cultures, abdominal imaging, and trends in stool for Clostridium difficile (C."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: No signs of sepsis on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 5**] as pt was normotensive.  Likely acquired from urine source as pt
   has positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although
   pt has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Lactate is normal. Overnight, patient became febrile and hypotensive
   consistent with recurrent sepsis. WBC increased from 17 to 44
   overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Ceftaz per ID recommendations
   - Continue Gent until cultures clear
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs
   - Consider repeat spinal imaging
   - US pacer/AICD pocket
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - Remove HD line today by IR

   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff (1^st sample pending)
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. History of Hypotension: differential includes sepsis given
   bactermia, and pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday.
   However, given that this only occurred with dialysis, it may be due to
   hypovolemia.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or
   ECG changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in
   the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   concerning for contined sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday for
   bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - removal of HD line by IR today
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension. The patient has been on ceftazidime for 2 days and gentamicin is pending. The source of the bacteremia is likely from a line infection, as the patient has positive urine culture for pseudomonas aeruginosa. He developed recurrent sepsis overnight with an increase in white blood cell count and fever. The patient also has a history of back pain, but a CT scan at OSH did not show any signs of an epidural abscess. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, pressors, and pain control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas Bacteremia: The patient has recurrent sepsis and bacteremia with pseudomonas aeruginosa. This can lead to further systemic complications if not managed appropriately.
2. Line Infection: The source of the bacteremia is likely a line infection, which needs to be addressed by removing the infected lines.
3. GPC Bacteremia: There is a possibility of gram-positive bacteremia, which may be contaminants or true infections. It"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: No signs of sepsis on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 5**] as pt was normotensive.  Likely acquired from urine source as pt
   has positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although
   pt has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Lactate is normal. Overnight, patient became febrile and hypotensive
   consistent with recurrent sepsis. WBC increased from 17 to 44
   overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - continue Ceftaz per ID recommendations; patient received 1 dose gent
   on [**4-22**]
   - consider double-coverage with Cipro; although per ID, this is not
   necessary
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs
   - monitor for signs of endocarditis and consider TEE for higher quality
   imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - remove HD line today (and likely replace) by IR
 culture tip
   - remove other lines and plan for line holiday until cx clear
 culture
   tip
   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. History of Hypotension: differential includes sepsis given
   bactermia, and pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday.
   However, given that this only occurred with dialysis, it may be due to
   hypovolemia.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or
   ECG changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in
   the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   concerning for contined sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday for
   bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - removal of HD line by IR today
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures showed pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is likely that the source of infection is a urinary tract infection (UTI). An echocardiogram done at the previous hospital was negative for vegetations, reducing the concern for endocarditis. The patient has been on ceftazidime for 2 days. The recent development of fever and hypotension suggests recurrent sepsis. The patient's white blood cell count increased from 17 to 44 overnight, indicating a possible line infection. Lactate levels are normal, which is reassuring. The patient received one dose of gentamicin on [4-22]. ID consult is recommended. It is advised to continue ceftazidime as per ID recommendations and consider double-coverage with ciprofloxacin. Abdominal imaging should be considered per ID recommendations.

- The patient also has gram-positive cocci in the blood, which may be contaminants or a separate bacteremia concern. This will be monitored with continued vancomycin dosed per hemodialysis and redrawn blood cultures.
- The patient's history of hypotension may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac events. The patient required dopamine infusion which was weaned yesterday, but hypotension occurred again overnight, necess"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who was admitted with sepsis and pseudomonal bacteremia. He developed hypotension and fever after HD yesterday, resulting in the removal of the HD line. He is currently on levophed, a medication used to support blood pressure. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, blood pressure ranging from 60/27 mmHg to 112/50 mmHg, heart rate between 60-123 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 81.6 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 227 mL and output of 700 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing infection and sepsis. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the pseudomonal bacteremia.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's edema in both lower extremities and positive fluid balance may indicate fluid overload. This can contribute to further complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening renal function.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires careful monitoring and management. Levophed is currently being used to support blood pressure, but adjustments may be necessary based on the patient's condition.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates worsening renal function. AKI can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload, which can have significant implications for the patient's overall health.

5. Line-related complications: The removal of the HD line was necessary due to the patient's hypotension and fever. However, there is a risk of line-related infections or bleeding at the insertion site.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has lower extremity edema, which increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin should be continued to prevent clot formation.

7. Ventilatory support: The patient's respiratory rate is on the higher end of the normal range, and his ABG results are not provided. Close monitoring of respiratory status is essential, and intubation may be required if respiratory failure occurs.

8. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, indicating the need for careful monitoring and management to prevent hyperglycemia-related complications.

9. Cardiac status: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is on aspirin and statin therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - check gent level
   - Change ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - place PICC line then D/C femoral line
   -  TTE or TEE to evaluate for endocarditis
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket  ultrasound
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was admitted to the ICU with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia, associated with hypotension and fever. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient has been febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The source of bacteremia is suspected to be the urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's femoral line remains in place, which may be infected, as cultures have shown growth of GNR (likely pseudomonas). The patient has been on ceftazidime for 2 days, and it is unclear where the pseudomonas is growing. 
- Recommendation: Continue Gentamicin, Flagyl (4-week course of antibiotics), check gentamicin levels, change ceftazidime to meropenem, surveillance blood cultures, place PICC line, and discharge femoral line.

2. GPCs in blood: The presence of GPCs in the blood may be due to contamination or a true bacteremia. It is recommended to continue vancomycin dosed per HD, redraw blood cultures,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Ceftaz, Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent
   should continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Confirm Ceftaz with ID team given HD dosing and difficulty of
   checking levels; will check [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivities when newest culture is
   speciated
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs to rule out other collections
   - Consider repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain,
   bacteremia
   - F/U US of pacer/AICD pocket (done yesterday, no read)
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Consider TTE today per ID recs
   - Trend surveillence blood cultures, catheter tip cultures
   - Removed HD line [**4-23**] by IR
 tip culture pending
   - Plan to maintain femoral line for pressors/abx for now; remove EJ
   line; plan for line holiday until cx clear for 24 hours (culture tips)
   - Attempt to place peripheral line earlier rather than later as patient
   will become more edematous with time
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   9. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal/cardiac diabetic diet as
   tolerated; 1500 cc fluid restriction daily

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever. 

The patient has been febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis, suggesting the possibility of sepsis. Blood cultures are positive for GNR, likely pseudomonas, in one aerobic bottle. The patient's lines, including the tunneled (Hickman) line, femoral line, and external jugular (EJ) line, have been removed, and cultures from the catheter tips are pending. 

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, including ceftazidime, gentamicin, and metronidazole, which should be continued for a four-week course. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, requiring the use of dopamine and levophed infusions. 

The patient also has chronic back pain, but imaging did not reveal any abscess. 

The patient's Hct has dropped, possibly due to dilutional effects from fluid administration. 

The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU pending clinical improvement. 

Potential Medical Complications: 

1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia may lead to further complications if not effectively managed.
2. GPC Bacteremia: Although less likely, the presence of GPC in blood cultures should be monitored and treated accordingly.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac issues. It is important to monitor blood pressure and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient requires a new line placement after the line holiday (48 hours culture negative) for bacteremia.
5. PVD: The patient's peripheral vascular disease should be managed with pentoxifylline.
6. Back Pain: The patient's back pain requires further evaluation, and pain control measures should be implemented.
7. CAD: The patient's coronary artery disease should be managed with aspirin and statin therapy, while avoiding beta-blockers in the setting of hypotension.
8. DM: The patient's diabetes mellitus should be managed with careful glycemic control, especially during hemodialysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Ceftaz, Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent
   should continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Confirm Ceftaz with ID team given HD dosing and difficulty of
   checking levels; will check [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivities when newest culture is
   speciated
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs to rule out other collections
   - Consider repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain,
   bacteremia
   - F/U US of pacer/AICD pocket (done yesterday, no read)
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Consider TTE today per ID recs
   - Trend surveillence blood cultures, catheter tip cultures
   - Removed HD line [**4-23**] by IR
 tip culture pending
   - Plan to maintain femoral line for pressors/abx for now; remove EJ
   line; plan for line holiday until cx clear for 24 hours (culture tips)
   - Attempt to place peripheral line earlier rather than later as patient
   will become more edematous with time
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   9. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal/cardiac diabetic diet as
   tolerated; 1500 cc fluid restriction daily
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots
   # Access: Femoral CVL

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- He was admitted with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
- The source of infection is likely the urinary tract, as the patient has a positive urine culture.
- He has been on ceftazidime, gentamicin, and metronidazole antibiotics.
- His lines have been removed, and cultures are pending.
- The patient is still febrile and hypotensive, requiring pressor support.
- There is concern for sepsis, especially post-dialysis.
- An echocardiogram did not show vegetations, making endocarditis unlikely.
- The patient has new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall, septum, and apex, indicating possible cardiac involvement.
- Other possible sources of infection include the abdominal area, as there is a concern for abscesses.
- Repeat imaging is needed to rule out other collections.
- Monitoring for signs of endocarditis is important, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned for higher quality imaging.
- The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-negative rods (GNR), which could be pseudomon"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - PICC line in place
   - F/U on TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Pt hypotensive this morning [**4-25**] to systolics in 70s-80s; given 250
   cc fluid bolus.  Not tachycardic, had been given opiates so this may
   have contributed.
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting

   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis, GPC bacteremia, hypotension, and possible endocarditis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient has a positive culture for pseudomonas, indicating a bacterial infection. This could lead to sepsis if the infection spreads throughout the body.
2. GPC bacteremia: The patient also has a positive culture for gram-positive cocci, which may indicate another bacterial infection. If left untreated, this could progress to sepsis as well.
3. Endocarditis: Although the initial echocardiogram did not show vegetations, there is a concern for endocarditis due to the presence of murmurs and positive blood cultures. This can lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which can be caused by sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac events. If not properly"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- He was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
- The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on various antibiotics, including ceftazidime, gentamicin, metronidazole, and meropenem.
- He has multiple lines, including a PICC line, femoral line, and EJ line, which have been removed due to infection.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 93/53 to 120/68 mmHg, heart rate between 60-70 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, glucose levels, and lactic acid. Other labs are within normal limits.
- The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis/pseudomonas bacteremia, GPC bacteremia, hypotension, ESRD on HD, C. diff-associated disease, PVD, back pain, CAD, DM, and drop in hematocrit.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas Bacteremia: The patient has pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics are necessary.
2. GPC Bacteremia: Although the source of GPC bacteremia is uncertain, it should be treated with vancomycin and regular blood culture surveillance.
3. Hypotension: The patient's recurrent hypotension may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac events. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with pressors or fluid resuscitation are required.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient requires ongoing hemodialysis management, including the placement of a new line after the current line holiday.
5. C. Diff-associated Disease: Continue treatment with Flagyl and follow up with ID recommendations.
6. PVD: Continue Pentoxifylline treatment.
7. Back Pain: Further evaluation and management of the patient's chronic back pain, considering imaging results and consultation with neurosurgery.
8. CAD: Continue aspirin and statin therapy, hold beta-blocker in the setting of hypotension.
9. DM: Monitor glycemic control, especially during hemodialysis, and consider starting oral hyperglycemic agents if necessary.
10. Drop in Hct: Monitor hemoglobin levels closely and consider transfusion if Hct drops below 22.

Overall, the patient requires careful management of multiple medical complications and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - PICC line in place
   - F/U on TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Pt hypotensive this morning [**4-25**] to systolics in 70s-80s; given 250
   cc fluid bolus.  Not tachycardic, had been given opiates so this may
   have contributed.
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia, associated with hypotension and fever. 

The patient's current condition includes sepsis/pseudomonas bacteremia, GPCs in blood (possibly contaminant), hypotension, ESRD on HD, C. Diff associated disease, PVD, back pain, CAD, and DM.

Assessment and plan:
1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient is febrile and hypotensive, suggesting ongoing infection. An echo was done at OSH, which was negative for vegetations, reducing concern for endocarditis. However, the patient has a murmur that he has had in the past. The source of the bacteremia is likely from a urinary source, as the patient has a positive urinary tract infection (UTI). The femoral and external jugular (EJ) lines have been removed, and the hemodialysis (HD) line is growing GNR. The ID recommendations include continuing gentamicin, Flagyl (will need a 4-week course of antibiotics; gentamicin should continue until blood cultures clear), changing ceftazidime to meropenem until the patient is back on HD, and surveillance blood cultures.
2. GPCs in blood: This may be a contaminant or possibly gram-positive bacteremia. The plan includes continuing vancomycin dosed per HD, redrawing blood cultures daily, and following up with cultures from OSH.
3. Hypotension: The patient required dopamine and levophed, which were weaned off. Differential includes sepsis given bacteremia, hypovolemia given the setting of dialysis, or cardiac event. The echo showed new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall, septum, and apex. The patient developed hypotension again overnight, and a fluid bolus was given. The plan includes monitoring blood pressures and holding tamsulosin as it may contribute to hypotension.
4. ESRD on HD: A new line needs to be placed after line holiday (48 hours culture negative) for bacteremia. If unable to wait for surveillance cultures, a temporary line placement will be needed. The renal dialysis team is consulting, and cultures will be followed up.
5. C. Diff associated disease: The patient should continue with Flagyl and follow up with ID recommendations.
6. PVD: The patient should continue with pentoxifylline.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - check gent level
   - Change ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - place PICC line then D/C femoral line
   -  TTE or TEE to evaluate for endocarditis
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket  ultrasound
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics including gentamicin, meropenem, and Flagyl for suspected Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient has a central venous line infection indicated by the growing gram-negative rod (GNR) tip culture. The femoral line has been removed, and a new PICC line has been placed. The patient is at risk for developing further complications such as sepsis, endocarditis, hypotension, and hypovolemia. 

There are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing bacteremia with pseudomonas and GPC. There is a risk of developing sepsis if the infection spreads throughout the body.

2. Endocarditis: The patient has a murmur on examination, and there is a concern for endocarditis. Further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned.

3. Hypotension: The patient has required vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. Hypotension could be due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently in the ICU for septic shock caused by a pseudomonal HD cath infection. He is still experiencing resolving shock, impaired skin integrity, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of back pain, anemia, and no known drug allergies. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 76/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 81.6 kg. His fluid balance shows an input of 1,220 mL and output of 970 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,220 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving multiple medications and IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has a pre-existing condition of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which can worsen due to sepsis and inadequate fluid management.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
3. Sepsis: The patient is still at risk for sepsis due to his critical condition and underlying infections.
4. Back pain: The patient's worsening back pain may indicate a potential underlying spinal issue or"

 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2167-4-25**] 09:27 AM
   - Patient became hypotensive into 60s (asymptomatic). Vasopressin
   started.
   - CT abd/pelvis non-contrast looking for abdominal source: New small to
   moderate bilateral pleural effusions with simple fluid attenuation,
   there is associate compressive atelectasis.  There has been prior
   mediastinotomy.  Pacer wires seen.  Coronary artery calcifications.
   Large stones in gallbladder (unchanged).  Cystic lesions in pancreas.
   Left upper pole mass, left lower pole cyst, right heterogeneous lower
   pole lesions are poorly evaluated.
   No free air in abdomen.  Mild diffuse mesenteric stranding and
   anasarca. No RP lymphadenopathy.
   1. no acute intraabdominal/pelvic process to explain symptoms
   2. multiple pancreatic/renal lesions
   3. cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
   4. new small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions
   TTE:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ?
   30 percent). The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is at least mild
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious vegetations;
   significant left ventricular contractile dysfunction and aortic
   stenosis
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures daily
   - PICC line in place
   - suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - Abd/pelvis CT without appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, off of pressors transiently and now. Differential
   includes sepsis given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of
   dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG
   changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the
   anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   and episode several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued
   sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   - wean vasopressin as tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - likely temporary HD placement tomorrow followed by dialysis (line by
   renal team)
   - monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   - still with urine in bladder
 bladder scan today and straight cath as
   needed
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn (start with 2.5 mg as 5 mg caused
   oversedation), standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient is febrile and hypotensive overnight, indicating possible sepsis. Bacteremia is likely acquired from a urinary source, and the patient has a positive urinary tract infection (UTI). An echocardiogram did not show vegetations, reducing the concern for endocarditis. Cultures are positive for GNR, and the femoral and EJ lines have been removed. A new temporary HD line will be placed.
2. GPCs in blood: This may be a contaminant or gram-positive bacteremia. Blood cultures will be redrawn daily, and vancomycin dosed per HD will be discontinued.
3. Hypotension: The patient required dopamine and levophed, indicating possible sepsis or hypovolemia. Cardiac events seem unlikely, but an echo showed new wall motion abnormalities. The patient's blood pressure"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2167-4-25**] 09:27 AM
   - Patient became hypotensive into 60s (asymptomatic). Vasopressin
   started.
   - CT abd/pelvis non-contrast looking for abdominal source: New small to
   moderate bilateral pleural effusions with simple fluid attenuation,
   there is associate compressive atelectasis.  There has been prior
   mediastinotomy.  Pacer wires seen.  Coronary artery calcifications.
   Large stones in gallbladder (unchanged).  Cystic lesions in pancreas.
   Left upper pole mass, left lower pole cyst, right heterogeneous lower
   pole lesions are poorly evaluated.
   No free air in abdomen.  Mild diffuse mesenteric stranding and
   anasarca. No RP lymphadenopathy.
   1. no acute intraabdominal/pelvic process to explain symptoms
   2. multiple pancreatic/renal lesions
   3. cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
   4. new small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions
   TTE:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ?
   30 percent). The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is at least mild
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious vegetations;
   significant left ventricular contractile dysfunction and aortic
   stenosis
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures daily
   - PICC line in place
   - suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - Abd/pelvis CT without appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, off of pressors transiently and now. Differential
   includes sepsis given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of
   dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG
   changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the
   anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   and episode several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued
   sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   - wean vasopressin as tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - likely temporary HD placement tomorrow followed by dialysis
   - monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   - still with urine in bladder
 bladder scan today and straight cath as
   needed
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is experiencing resolving septic shock due to a pseudomonal HD cath infection. He is still intermittently requiring vasopressin and has impaired skin integrity. The patient's back pain, renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction are the main concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonal HD cath infection: The patient's current condition is attributed to a pseudomonal infection in the hemodialysis (HD) catheter. This infection can lead to further complications such as bacteremia or sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD, indicating chronic kidney disease. This condition increases the risk of various complications like fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for ongoing dialysis treatment.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can be a result of reduced blood flow, poor nutrition, or underlying infections. It increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and other skin-related complications.
4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Although the patient's septic shock is resolving, he still has sepsis without organ dysfunction. Sepsis can progress rapidly and lead to organ dysfunction, so close monitoring and prompt treatment are essential to prevent complications.
5. Back pain: The patient's back pain may be due to musculoskeletal issues or possibly related to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing
   pseudomonas. Pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid
   collection or abscess in the right chest. Abd/pelvis CT without
   appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - Surveillance blood cultures daily (given 5 days negative, can stop
   trending)
   - PICC line in place
   - Suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week.
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The patient required dopamine and norepinephrine infusions for hypotension, which improved after weaning off the pressors. He also has new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall, septum, and apex of his heart. The source of bacteremia is likely from a urinary tract infection (UTI), and there is concern for infected intravenous lines as well. The patient's renal function is compromised, and he requires a new temporary HD line placement due to his current line being infected. Other medical conditions include Clostridium difficile-associated disease, chronic back pain, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient has been febrile and hypotensive overnight, indicating ongoing sepsis despite antibiotic treatment. There is a concern for further complications if the infection spreads or if the source of infection is not effectively managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac issues. Continuous monitoring and appropriate fluid management are"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing
   pseudomonas. Pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid
   collection or abscess in the right chest. Abd/pelvis CT without
   appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - Surveillance blood cultures daily (given 5 days negative, can stop
   trending)
   - PICC line in place
   - Suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week (scheduled for Wednesday).
   - daily EKG
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, off of pressors transiently and now. Differential
   includes sepsis given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of
   dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG
   changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the
   anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   and episode several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued
   sepsis. Currently off of all pressors.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension (consider
   restart if BP tolerates)
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.

   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 81.6 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has a history of renal failure and is currently on hemodialysis (HD). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 111/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and various other ICU medications.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (44.1 K/uL), elevated platelet count (190 K/uL), elevated creatinine levels (3.1-6.0 mg/dL), and elevated blood glucose levels (55-117 mg/dL). Other lab results include normal PT/PTT/INR, slightly elevated ALT/AST, elevated alkaline phosphatase, normal differential count, elevated lactic acid, low albumin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, normal calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient's history of renal failure and elevated creatinine levels indicate ongoing kidney dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for continued hemodialysis.

2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and recent blood culture may suggest an ongoing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock caused by a pseudomonal HD catheter infection. His vital signs are stable, and he no longer requires vasopressin. The patient has received appropriate antibiotic therapy, and his white blood cell count is decreasing. He is being managed for pain, Clostridium difficile infection, and other issues as per the ICU team's recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD, which puts him at risk for further deterioration of kidney function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and adherence to the prescribed dialysis regimen is essential to prevent complications associated with renal failure.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and poor wound healing. Proper skin care and regular repositioning can help mitigate these risks.

3. Sepsis: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, there is still a risk of developing sepsis due to his underlying condition and potential infections. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and prompt identification and treatment of any signs of infection are crucial.

4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient's history of a pseudomonal HD catheter infection indicates a risk of future catheter-related bloodstream infections. Strict adherence to sterile techniques during catheter insertion and maintenance is necessary to prevent such infections."
