   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of htn and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis complicated by hypoxia, hypotension,
   and acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercapneic and Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Likely ARDS. The
   patient was intubated yesterday morning due to tachypnea and hypoxia in
   the setting of receiving many liters of IVF while oliguric.  Since
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**] ICU, has had difficulty maintaining oxygenation,
   despite alveolar recruitment maneuvers, positioning of bed, very
   elevated PEEP, esophageal balloon pressures.  Slowly desaturating
   further into 80s%.  Lung compliance low, and peak pressures 35-40,
   which suggest stiff lungs. Has an associated respiratory acidosis.
   - push ETT in 2cm further
   - increase tidal volumes and increase peak pressures; goal to increase
   pH to 7.3 and stabilize
   - increase PEEP further
   - Check serial ABGs to assess ventilation.
   - Propofol and fentanyl prn for sedation.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Not responsive to fluids.  Was on three
   pressors last night briefly but weaned off phenylephrine
was just
   needed in the setting of BP drop after IV metoprolol bolused.  CVP
   estimated to be about 5.
   - Levophed prn + vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will follow CVP and continue with aggressive IVF (LR) fluid repletion
   given 3rd spacing physiology with pancreatitis.
   - f/u  blood cultures, UA, and UCx
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis +
   Vancomycin
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr  increased further from 4.2 to 5.2 and oliguric.  Likely  ATN but
   possibly has postrenal obstruction or other intrarenal causes such as
   AIN.  Renal consult this AM called.
   - f/u renal recs  b/c may need CVVH in the near future if he remains
   oliguric and his K continues to rise.
   - f/u urine lytes.
   - Trend Cr.
   - Renal US to rule out postrenal cause.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stone still in place.  CBD stent placed
   by ERCP fellow.  Likely will worsen 24hrs post procedure before he can
   get better b/c of transient bacteremia caused by procedure.  Have
   repleted calcium significantly overnight
   - replete calcium as necessary for continued drop due to
   saponification. Improving lipase and amylase.
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - NPO with IVF
bolus as needed for pressures
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  He was weaned off the insulin gtt
   prior to transfer.  no documentation sent with the amount of insulin he
   received by insulin gtt at outside hospital
   - continue to check q6h fingersticks and cover with SSI.  Will add up
   his 24 hour requirements and start a long-acting [**Doctor Last Name **].
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct stable at 38.  Guaiac + diarrhea.
   - Active type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are 156 which is stable in last
   couple days. (platelets 202 at outside hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.

   Code status: full
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis complicated by hypoxia, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing difficulty maintaining oxygenation despite various interventions, and his respiratory function appears to be deteriorating. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low respiratory system compliance and high peak pressures, indicating stiff lungs. There is evidence of hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to stabilize, and he has required multiple vasopressors. His central venous pressure (CVP) is estimated to be about 5, indicating low blood volume. He has ongoing hypotension and septic shock, and aggressive fluid repletion is being continued.

The patient also has acute renal failure, with an increase in creatinine from 4.2 to 5.2 and oliguria. There is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but other intrarenal causes should also be considered. A renal consult has been called, and the plan includes following renal recommendations, considering continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), and avoiding nephrotoxins.

The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which resulted in the placement of a CBD stent. It is expected that his condition may worsen in the next 24 hours due"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of htn and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis complicated by hypoxia, hypotension,
   and acute renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient was intubated yesterday morning due
   to tachypnea and hypoxia in the setting of receiving many liters of IVF
   while oliguric.  Since transfer to [**Hospital1 5**] ICU, has had difficulty
   maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar recruitment maneuvers,
   positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP, esophageal balloon pressures.
   Slowly desaturating further into 80s%
   - Check serial ABGs to assess ventilation.
   - Propofol and fentanyl prn for sedation.
   .
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stone still in place.  CBD stent placed
   by ERCP fellow.  Likely will worsen 24hrs post procedure before he can
   get better b/c of transient bacteremia caused by procedure.  Have
   repleted calcium significantly overnight
   - replete calcium as necessary for continued drop due to saponification
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - NPO with IVF
bolus as needed for pressures
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Not responsive to fluids.  Was on three
   pressors last night briefly but weaned off phenylephrine
was just
   needed in the setting of BP drop after IV metoprolol bolused.
   - Levophed prn + vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will follow CVP and continue with aggressive IVF (LR) fluid repletion
   given 3rd spacing physiology with pancreatitis.
   - Will try to keep PEEP < 15 if possible.
   - Sending blood cultures, UA, and UCx
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis +
   Vancomycin
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr  increased further from 4.2 to 5.2 and oliguric.  Likely  ATN but
   possibly has postrenal obstruction or other intrarenal causes such as
   AIN.  Renal consult this AM called.
   - f/u renal recs  b/c may need CVVH in the near future if he remains
   oliguric and his K continues to rise.
   - f/u urine lytes.
   - Trend Cr.
   - Renal US to rule out postrenal cause.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  He was weaned off the insulin gtt
   prior to transfer.  no documentation sent with the amount of insulin he
   received by insulin gtt at outside hospital
   - Will check q6h fingersticks and cover with SSI.  Will add up his 24
   hour requirements and start a long-acting [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - consider insulin gtt
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct stable at 38.  Guaiac + diarrhea.
   - Active type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are 156 which is stable in last
   couple days. (platelets 202 at outside hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, hypoxia, hypotension, and acute renal failure. He was intubated due to tachypnea and hypoxia, but has had difficulty maintaining oxygenation despite various interventions. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing respiratory failure, persistent hypotension, septic shock, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can progress to severe hypoxemia and respiratory arrest if not managed properly.
2. Hypotension/Septhic Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and need for multiple vasopressors indicate ongoing septic shock. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria suggest acute renal failure. This can progress to complete renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state if not managed with insulin therapy.
5. Anemia: The patient's decreased hemoglobin levels may indicate anemia,"

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, and reviewed his history, labs and
   imaging throughout the day. I was present for the key portions of the
   services provided and have spoken at length with renal consultants. I
   have reviewed the note by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9313**] above and I largely agree with her
   findings and plan of care.
   Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 9349**] is extraordinarily ill, with cholangitis,  pancreatitis,
   ARDS, renal failure, hypotension, and severe third space volume
   overload.  Most of the day was spent manipulating his vent according to
   esophageal pressure measurements which suggested that due to his large
   tense abdomen (bladder pressure 18 ) his pleural pressures were very
   high, thus allowing significant increase in VT and Peep.  However the
   major improvement has come with our nursing him in decubitus position
   which has allowed improved oxygenation (a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9350**]). Current vent
   settings are Fi02 80%, Vt450cc, RR 36, PEEP 21, VE15L/min, and
   inhalation Transpulm pressure of 41-30 or 11cm.
   His urine output is nil and a hemodialysis catheter has been placed by
   IR femorally which should may be needed soon, but right now with his
   CVP of 23 and Ppl end exhalation of 23, he appears to have room for
   more intravascular fluid.
   He remains critically ill, but amylase and lactate are improving and
   he
s not significantly acidotic.  We are following lytes, calcium,
   hemodynamics closely.  Family was present today and know the gravity of
   the situation as does his attorney health care proxy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, complicated by hypoxia, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) involving respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal systems. He requires mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, multiple vasopressors for hemodynamic instability, and hemodialysis for renal failure. The patient also has hyperglycemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of htn and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio is 84 this AM.
   The patient was intubated Saturday morning due to tachypnea and hypoxia
   in the setting of receiving many liters of IVF while oliguric.
   Initially, had difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar
   recruitment maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP,
   esophageal balloon pressures.  Change of bed with 35 degree tilting
   appeared to help oxygenation as his vent settings have decreased.
   - Attempt to wean down vent settings as patient can
   - Check serial ABGs to assess ventilation.
   - Propofol and fentanyl prn for sedation.
   - Continue bed positioning
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Intermittent fluid boluses are not clear
   if helpful as difficult to assess volume status.  Was intially on three
   pressors; weaned off phenylephrine and levophed dose is decreasing as
   well. Also with new fever spike while on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Continue to wean levophed + vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will follow change in CVP and attempts to continue with IVF
   resusciation given 3rd spacing physiology with pancreatitis, but to be
   careful with tenous respiratory status
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx
s and sputum cultures
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis +
   Vancomycin renally dosed
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr  increased further from 5.9 to 6.9 this AM.  Likely  ATN highest on
   differential at this point.
   - Patient s/p IR HD femoral line placement
   - Contact renal  b/c may likely need CVVH today as patient is getting
   fluids and not urinating
   - f/u urine lytes: Fe Urea: 9.43%; likely pre-renal state
   - Trend Cr.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Follow bladder pressures and lactate
if continuing to increase
   consider calling surgery for possible decompression of compartment
   syndrome
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio and dilt gtt to control HR.
   Patient with adequately controlled rate on these two medications.
   -  Stop dilt gtt today as patient as heart rate is well controlled
   -  Continue amio gtt
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stone still in place.  CBD stent placed
   by ERCP fellow.  Likely will worsen 24hrs post procedure before he can
   get better b/c of transient bacteremia caused by procedure.  Have
   repleted calcium significantly overnight
   - replete calcium as necessary for continued drop due to
   saponification. Improving lipase and amylase.
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - NPO with IVF
bolus as needed for pressures
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31.4.  Guaiac + diarrhea +
   fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's respiratory status has been improving with changes in bed positioning and recruitment maneuvers. However, there are concerns about maintaining oxygenation and ventilation. The plan is to attempt weaning down the vent settings as the patient can tolerate it, check serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) to assess ventilation, continue bed positioning, and provide sedation with propofol and fentanyl as needed.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension and septic shock. Despite receiving multiple pressors, intermittent fluid boluses have not been helpful in assessing volume status. The goal is to continue weaning off the pressors while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures have been obtained, and the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level from 5.9 to 6.9. This is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has undergone intermittent hemodialysis (HD) via a femoral line. Renal dosing of medications and"

   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr  increased further from 5.9 to 6.9 this AM.  Likely  ATN highest on
   differential at this point.
   - Patient s/p IR HD femoral line placement
   - Contact renal  b/c may likely need CVVH today as patient is getting
   fluids and not urinating
   - f/u urine lytes: Fe Urea: 9.43%; likely pre-renal state

   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio and dilt gtt to control HR.
   Patient with adequately controlled rate on these two medications.
   -  Consider stopping dilt gtt
   -  Continue amio gtt
   - Goal to keep patient

   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stone still in place.  CBD stent placed
   by ERCP fellow.  Likely will worsen 24hrs post procedure before he can
   get better b/c of transient bacteremia caused by procedure.  Have
   repleted calcium significantly overnight
   - replete calcium as necessary for continued drop due to

   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  He was weaned off the insulin gtt
   prior to transfer.  no documentation sent with the amount of insulin he
   received by insulin gtt at outside hospital

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, likely ARDS with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 84 this morning. He was intubated due to tachypnea and hypoxia while receiving many liters of IV fluids while oliguric. Initially, there were difficulties maintaining oxygenation despite alveolar recruitment maneuvers, positioning of the bed, very elevated PEEP, and esophageal balloon pressures. Changing the bed to a 35-degree tilt appeared to help oxygenation, as his vent settings have decreased.

The patient also has hypotension/Septic Shock, not responsive to fluids. He was initially on three pressors, but the doses of phenylephrine and levophed are decreasing. Levophed prn + vasopressin are being used to maintain MAPs >65. Aggressive IVF fluid repletion is being continued given the third spacing physiology with pancreatitis, but with caution due to tenuous respiratory status. Blood cultures, UA, and UCx are being followed, and Zosyn and Vancomycin are being renally dosed.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, with a rising creatinine level from 5.9 to 6.9 this morning"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of htn and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio is 84 this AM.
   The patient was intubated Saturday morning due to tachypnea and hypoxia
   in the setting of receiving many liters of IVF while oliguric.
   Initially, had difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar
   recruitment maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP,
   esophageal balloon pressures.  Change of bed with 35 degree tilting
   appeared to help oxygenation as his vent settings have decreased.
   - Attempt to wean down vent settings as patient can
   - Check serial ABGs to assess ventilation.
   - Propofol and fentanyl prn for sedation.
   - Continue bed positioning
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Intermittent fluid boluses are not clear
   if helpful as difficult to assess volume status.  Was intially on three
   pressors; weaned off phenylephrine and levophed dose is decreasing as
   well. Also with new fever spike while on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Continue to wean levophed + vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will follow change in CVP and attempts to continue with IVF
   resusciation given 3rd spacing physiology with pancreatitis, but to be
   careful with tenous respiratory status
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx
s and sputum cultures
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis +
   Vancomycin renally dosed
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr  increased further from 5.9 to 6.9 this AM.  Likely  ATN highest on
   differential at this point.
   - Patient s/p IR HD femoral line placement
   - Contact renal  b/c may likely need CVVH today as patient is getting
   fluids and not urinating
   - f/u urine lytes: Fe Urea: 9.43%; likely pre-renal state
   - Trend Cr.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Follow bladder pressures and lactate
if continuing to increase
   consider calling surgery for possible decompression of compartment
   syndrome
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio and dilt gtt to control HR.
   Patient with adequately controlled rate on these two medications.
   -  Stop dilt gtt today as patient as heart rate is well controlled
   -  Continue amio gtt
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stone still in place.  CBD stent placed
   by ERCP fellow.  Likely will worsen 24hrs post procedure before he can
   get better b/c of transient bacteremia caused by procedure.  Have
   repleted calcium significantly overnight
   - replete calcium as necessary for continued drop due to
   saponification. Improving lipase and amylase.
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - NPO with IVF
bolus as needed for pressures
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31.4.  Guaiac + diarrhea +
   fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are 107 from peak at 157 [**9-24**].
   (platelets 202 at outside hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding
   - D/C sub q heparin

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient and reviewed his hospital course to
   date. I have also gone over his labs, hemodynamics, imaging, and vent
   settings and status, and have spent considerable time at the bedside
   with RRT
s on the patient
s vent settings.  I have also reviewed Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 9271**]
s note above. I agree with her findings and plan of care.  Mr
   [**Known lastname 9314**] remains very critically ill with sepsis from cholangitis,
   pancreatitis, ARDS, hypotension, renal failure, and intrabdominal
   hypertension.
   Regarding his ARDS, he
s some better with rotating bed which seems to
   help decrease the effect of his tense abdomen on his vent status.  None
   the less he
s tenous, on PEEP of 20 or more, 100% Fi02, and barely
   adequate sats and P02.  His lungs are stiff, and opacified.  Esophageal
   balloon pressured are not exactly making sense as they calculate to a
   TPP at inspiration that
s very small or negative.  TPP at end
   exhalation also neg. For now we
ll keep PEEP at 20 and be sure he
   tanked up.  Unfortunately if we use esoph press as indicator of Ppl
   then his corrected CVP is neg!  Hence for now we
ll correct CVP for
   PEEP (assume 25% of PEEP transmitted to pleural space pressure).  Thus
   his corrected CVP is 23-5 = 18 which is about where we
d want him.
   Unfortunately he
s still needing pressors though for now he
s not
   acidotic and lactate is surprisingly normal, suggesting his abdominal
   pressures are not causing gut ischemia.  Yet his abdomen is very large
   and tense with bladder pressures of 18-20.  I would appreciate surgery
   coming by and commenting on what criteria they
d use for surgical
   decompression. I would also seek their advice on how to decompress pt
   abdomen non surgically  (another trial of colonic airl decompression
   via catheter or c
scope?)
   Femoral HD line is in place though for now I think we have to be
   careful about removing any fluid via CVVH and he doesn
t need HD for
   electrolyte imbalance.
   His pancreatitis by amylase/lipase is subsiding, though he
s needed
   lots of calcium.  His WBC suggests his cholangitis is resolving as
   well.  He has a central line placed in OSH but right now it
s too risky
   to replace this line.
   His sister has been visiting and his attorney/proxy has made the
   patient DNR, not unreasonable given the current acuity and multiplicity
   of his problems.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been critical, with multiple organ dysfunction including respiratory, renal, and hepatic failure. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's hemodynamic status has been unstable, requiring multiple pressors. He has also developed acute renal failure, and his platelet count has significantly decreased. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty maintaining oxygenation, which may progress to further respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to cholangitis, and there is a risk of continued hypotension and organ dysfunction if the infection is not effectively treated.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to oliguric acute renal failure. There is a risk of worsening renal function and potential need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled hyperglycemia, indicating a risk of complications associated with high blood sugar levels.
6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall, 132.8 kg male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 100% FiO2. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in PRVC/AC mode with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, PEEP of 26 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 100%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 86, HCO3- of 22 mEq/L, and base excess of -3 mEq/L. The patient's blood culture results are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has a high bladder pressure of 15 mmHg, which suggests the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome. This condition occurs when increased pressure within the abdomen impairs blood flow and function of internal organs.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS):"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of htn and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio is 84 this AM.
   The patient was intubated Saturday morning due to tachypnea and hypoxia
   in the setting of receiving many liters of IVF while oliguric.
   Initially, had difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar
   recruitment maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP,
   esophageal balloon pressures.  Change of bed with 35 degree tilting
   appeared to help oxygenation as his vent settings have decreased.
   - Attempt to wean down vent settings as patient can
   - Check serial ABGs to assess ventilation.
   - Propofol and fentanyl prn for sedation.
   - Continue bed positioning
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Intermittent fluid boluses are not clear
   if helpful as difficult to assess volume status.  Was intially on three
   pressors; weaned off phenylephrine and levophed dose is decreasing as
   well. Also with new fever spike while on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Continue to wean levophed + vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will follow change in CVP and attempts to continue with IVF
   resusciation given 3rd spacing physiology with pancreatitis, but to be
   careful with tenous respiratory status
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx
s and sputum cultures
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis +
   Vancomycin renally dosed
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr  increased further from 6.9 to 7.2 this AM.  Likely  ATN highest on
   differential at this point. Started CVVH yesterday afternoon
   - Continue CVVH to get fluids off
   - f/u urine lytes: Fe Urea: 9.43%; likely pre-renal state
   - Trend Cr.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Follow bladder pressures and lactate
if continuing to increase
   consider calling surgery for possible decompression of compartment
   syndrome
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio and dilt gtt to control HR.
   Patient with adequately controlled rate on these two medications.
   -  Stop dilt gtt today as patient as heart rate is well controlled
   -  Continue amio gtt
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stone still in place.  CBD stent placed
   by ERCP fellow.  Likely will worsen 24hrs post procedure before he can
   get better b/c of transient bacteremia caused by procedure.  Have
   repleted calcium significantly overnight
   - replete calcium as necessary for continued drop due to
   saponification. Improving lipase and amylase.
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - NPO with IVF
bolus as needed for pressures
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31.4.  Guaiac + diarrhea +
   fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are 107 from peak at 157 [**9-24**].
   (platelets 202 at outside hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding
   - D/C sub q heparin

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma.
- He was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, which led to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been intubated due to tachypnea and hypoxia, and has been experiencing difficulty maintaining oxygenation.
- He was initially on three pressors but has been weaned off phenylephrine and levophed.
- The patient has been placed on vasopressin to maintain mean arterial pressures above 65.
- He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis.
- CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been started to remove fluids and improve oxygenation.
- The patient is also being treated for atrial fibrillation with amiodarone and diltiazem.
- He underwent an ERCP procedure and had a CBD stent placed.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and he has been placed on an insulin gtt.
- His Hct has decreased, indicating anemia, and he is being monitored closely.
- The patient's platelet count has also decreased, but there are no signs of active bleeding.
- He is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to being NPO (nothing by mouth).
- The patient's condition remains critical,"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of htn and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio is 84 this AM.
   The patient was intubated Saturday morning due to tachypnea and hypoxia
   in the setting of receiving many liters of IVF while oliguric.
   Initially, had difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar
   recruitment maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP,
   esophageal balloon pressures.  Change of bed with 35 degree tilting
   appeared to help oxygenation as his vent settings have decreased.
   - Attempt to wean down vent settings as patient can
   - Check serial ABGs to assess ventilation.
   - Propofol and fentanyl prn for sedation.
   - Continue bed positioning
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Intermittent fluid boluses are not clear
   if helpful as difficult to assess volume status.  Was intially on three
   pressors; weaned off phenylephrine and levophed dose is decreasing as
   well. Also with new fever spike while on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Continue to wean levophed + vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will follow change in CVP and attempts to continue with IVF
   resusciation given 3rd spacing physiology with pancreatitis, but to be
   careful with tenous respiratory status
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx
s and sputum cultures
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis +
   Vancomycin renally dosed
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr  increased further from 6.9 to 7.2 this AM.  Likely  ATN highest on
   differential at this point. Started CVVH yesterday afternoon
   - Continue CVVH to get fluids off
   - f/u urine lytes: Fe Urea: 9.43%; likely pre-renal state
   - Trend Cr.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Follow bladder pressures and lactate
if continuing to increase
   consider calling surgery for possible decompression of compartment
   syndrome
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio and dilt gtt to control HR.
   Patient with adequately controlled rate on these two medications.
   -  Stop dilt gtt today as patient as heart rate is well controlled
   -  Continue amio gtt
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stone still in place.  CBD stent placed
   by ERCP fellow.  Likely will worsen 24hrs post procedure before he can
   get better b/c of transient bacteremia caused by procedure.  Have
   repleted calcium significantly overnight
   - replete calcium as necessary for continued drop due to
   saponification. Improving lipase and amylase.
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - NPO with IVF
bolus as needed for pressures
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are trending down slowly.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, but HIT antibody sent, and subq heparin DCed
   yesterday.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside
   hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has undergone an ERCP procedure with the placement of a CBD stent. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including ARDS, hypotension, septic shock, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and gallstone pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty maintaining oxygenation despite efforts to improve alveolar recruitment and PEEP. Continued monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation.

2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite the use of multiple pressors. Ongoing monitoring and titration of vasopressor medications will be required to maintain adequate perfusion. Additionally, the patient may be at risk for further infections due to the ongoing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating worsening renal function. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) has been initiated to manage fluid balance and remove toxins from the blood. Close monitoring of renal function and"

   55 yo male with pmh of htn and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio is 84 this AM.
   The patient was intubated Saturday morning due to tachypnea and hypoxia
   in the setting of receiving many liters of IVF while oliguric.
   Initially, had difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar
   recruitment maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP,
   esophageal balloon pressures.  Change of bed with 35 degree tilting
   appeared to help oxygenation as his vent settings have decreased.
   - Attempt to wean down vent settings as patient can
   - Check serial ABGs to assess ventilation.
   - Propofol and fentanyl prn for sedation.
   - Continue bed positioning
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Intermittent fluid boluses are not clear
   if helpful as difficult to assess volume status.  Was intially on three
   pressors; weaned off phenylephrine and levophed dose is decreasing as
   well. Also with new fever spike while on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Continue to wean levophed + vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65.
   - Will follow change in CVP and attempts to continue with IVF

   differential at this point.
   - Patient s/p IR HD femoral line placement
   - Contact renal  b/c may likely need CVVH today as patient is getting
   fluids and not urinating
   - f/u urine lytes: Fe Urea: 9.43%; likely pre-renal state
   - Trend Cr.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Follow bladder pressures and lactate
if continuing to increase
   consider calling surgery for possible decompression of compartment
   syndrome
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio and dilt gtt to control HR.
   Patient with adequately controlled rate on these two medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to tachypnea and hypoxia. He has been difficult to oxygenate, but showed improvement with repositioning and changes in bed positioning. An esophageal balloon has been placed to help adjust PEEP based on balloon pressures. The patient has a CBD stent placed after an ERCP procedure. He remains on vasopressor support and has ongoing fluid resuscitation. His renal function is compromised, and he is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient is also being treated for hyperglycemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty maintaining oxygenation, which may be due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential. Weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously.

2. Septic shock: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. Pressor support will continue to be required to maintain adequate blood pressure. Fluid resuscitation may also be necessary.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating"

   recruitment maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP,
   esophageal balloon pressures but recently stable in 90s % O2sat w 100%
   FiO2.  Change of bed with 35 degree tilting appeared to help but
   difficult to do accurate CVVH w bed tilted, so he is supine.
   - Keep PEEP at 26 (or higher) but do not want to derecruit alveoli
   - Decrease FiO2 and check ABGs to get paO2 in 60s for ARDS protocol
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue bed positioning as tolerated to help improve increased
   perfusion to more ventilated areas
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Weaned off levophed this AM. Continues on
   Vasopressin.  Continues to be febrile
   - Cont vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65.
   - trend fever curve ; CVVH will bring temperatures down, so he may not

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU.

Summary of Progress:
- The patient has been difficult to oxygenate, but oxygenation has improved with repositioning and adjustment of PEEP.
- ERCP was performed, and a CBD stent was placed.
- An esophageal balloon was placed, and PEEP was adjusted based on balloon pressures.
- A new HD line was placed by IR the night before and CVVH was started as per renal team to remove fluid and improve oxygenation. The patient remains oliguric.
- P:F ratio has consistently been in the 80s, indicating ARDS.
- The patient has been weaned off levophed and is now on vasopressin alone.
- Fever persists, and the patient is febrile.
- Blood cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been administered.

   Patient is critically ill, prognosis poor.  continue to update
   family/hcp
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation with 100% FiO2 and high PEEP. He is also on vasopressin and other medications to manage his condition.

The patient's recent events include fever, ongoing requirement for pressor support, initiation of continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH), and continuous amiodarone infusion for atrial fibrillation.

His vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 114/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 100% FiO2. His CVP is 19 mmHg, CO/CI (Fick) is 5.9 L/min and 2.5 L/min/m2 respectively, and mixed venous O2% saturation is 63-63.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.7 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of 8.4 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 196/279). Other lab values include a glucose level of 167 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.7 mEq/L"

   Agree with plan to continue aggressive supportive care for GS
   pancreatitis and MODS.  He remains very tenuous from resp standpoint
   with high peep and fio2 requirements in setting of ards and large
   distended abd. Oxygenation has improved slightly with volume removal
   and increased peep.   Will continue ACV w/ ards net TVs, high peep
   guiding with esoph balloon. Will wean O2 as able to maintain paO2 > 60,
   following abgs closely. We continue to follow his bladder pressures to
   monitor for abd compartment syndrome as his very distended abd is
   contributing to his high peep needs..
   The most likely source of his continued temp is severe pancreatitis w/
   inflammation.  He is s/p ercp with CBD stone removal and stent and his
   enzymes and lfts are trending down.  We continue empiric vanco/zosyn
   Day 3 with cx data neg to date.  Will consider d/cing vanco once we
   confirm that osh cxs remain neg.
   He remains on cvvh and we will attempt increased volume removal as BP
   tolerates maintaining MAPS > 60.  Will try to d/c pressor (vasopressin)
   as able. We continue amio gtt  for load, for prior rapid a-fib,  now in
   nsr. We have a low suspicion for HIT but suspect his thrombocytopenia
   is related to failed liver and sepsis.  Counts remain stable.
   Pt is very ill with multi organ failure and very poor prognosis.  We
   continue to update his HCP and family.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and remains very tenuous with high oxygen requirements and large abdominal distension. Oxygenation has improved slightly with volume removal and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient continues to have fevers, likely due to severe pancreatitis inflammation. The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) stone removal and stent placement, and his enzymes and liver function tests are trending down. Empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics have been started, and the source of infection is being investigated. The patient remains on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and attempts will be made to increase volume removal as blood pressure permits, maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Vasopressin will be weaned off if tolerated. Amiodarone is being given for load due to prior rapid atrial fibrillation, now in normal sinus rhythm. Thrombocytopenia is suspected to be related to liver failure and sepsis. The patient's prognosis remains poor, and updates are being provided to"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio 120. Has had
   difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar recruitment
   maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP, esophageal balloon
   pressures but recently stable in 90s % O2sat w 60% FiO2.  Change of bed
   with 35 degree tilting appeared to help but difficult to do accurate
   CVVH w bed tilted, so he is supine.
   - Concerning as PIP and Plateau pressures are quite high. ( C=P/V)
   Goals to increase compliance: decrease volume with CVVH; Decrease TV to
   400, and if possible decrease peep (unlikely able to decrease this as
   do not want to de-recruit alveoli any further)
   - Decrease FiO2 and check ABGs to get paO2 in 60s for ARDS protocol
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue bed positioning as tolerated to help improve increased
   perfusion to more ventilated areas
   - Continue CVVH with as much volume to take off as can be tolerated to
   help improve oxygenation
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Weaned off levophed [**9-26**]. Vasopressin
   stopped overnight.  Continues to be febrile and now hypertensive off
   pressors.
   - No longer hypotensive; off pressors. Continue CVVH to increase volume
   removal and hopefully reduce bp some.
   - Consider anti-hypertensives if persistent SBP < 160
   - trend fever curve ; CVVH will bring temperatures down, so he may not
   be spiking fevers though he otherwise may have
   - culture if spikes through CVVH ; attempt PR Tylenol again
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx
s and sputum cultures (negative so far)
   - CXR today and if continues to spike consider abdominal CT to rule out
   other sources of possible infection
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis; D/C
   Vancomycin as unlikely Gram positive source of infection
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Cr  slowly coming down, but still very high and
   cannot monitor anymore because on CVVH.  Likely ATN highest on
   differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.
   - Continue CVVH to get fluids off
 increase rate from 150cc/hr to
   150-250cc/hr to see how he tolerates b/c BPs are better this AM
   - dose medications for CVVH
   - Follow bladder pressures and lactate
 if continuing to increase
   consider calling surgery to assess for possible decompression of
   compartment syndrome
   - Renal following: will ask if lasix trial is suitable yet.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day)
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - NPO with IVF
bolus as needed for pressures or give back fluid w CVVH
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   - Consider Insulin in TPN and attempt to wean down insulin gtt
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are trending down slowly.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, but HIT antibody sent, and subq heparin DCed
   yesterday.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside
   hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has difficulty maintaining oxygenation despite alveolar recruitment maneuvers, positioning of the bed, and elevated PEEP. There is a concern for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The goals are to increase compliance, decrease volume with CVVH, decrease TV to 400, and if possible, decrease PEEP.

2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient was weaned off levophed and vasopressin was stopped overnight. He continues to be febrile and now hypertensive off pressors. CVVH will help reduce blood pressure by increasing volume removal. Anti-hypertensives may be considered if the systolic blood pressure (SBP) remains below 160.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is slowly coming down but is still very high. CVVH is being continued to get fluids off and increase the rate from 150cc/hr to 150-250cc/hr. Medications for CVVH will be dosed accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio 120. Has had
   difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar recruitment
   maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP, esophageal balloon
   pressures but recently stable in 90s % O2sat w 60% FiO2.  Change of bed
   with 35 degree tilting appeared to help but difficult to do accurate
   CVVH w bed tilted, so he is supine.
   - Keep PEEP at 26 (or higher) but do not want to derecruit alveoli
   - Decrease FiO2 and check ABGs to get paO2 in 60s for ARDS protocol
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue bed positioning as tolerated to help improve increased
   perfusion to more ventilated areas
   - Continue CVVH with as much volume to take off as can be tolerated to
   help improve oxygenation
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Weaned off levophed [**9-26**]. Vasopressin
   stopped overnight.  Continues to be febrile
   - Cont vasopressin to maintain MAPs>65.
   - trend fever curve ; CVVH will bring temperatures down, so he may not
   be spiking fevers though he otherwise may have
   - culture if spikes through CVVH ; attempt PR Tylenol again
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx
s and sputum cultures (negative so far)
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis +
   Vancomycin renally dosed
   - check again w OSH about cultures to see if still negative; can peel
   off Vancomycin if all still negative because we need to cover mostly Gm
   Negs from biliary system
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr  increased still very high but cannot monitor anymore because on
   CVVH.  Likely  ATN highest on differential at this point. Started CVVH
   Monday afternoon [**9-25**]; patient tolerating well.
   - Continue CVVH to get fluids off
 increase rate from 150cc/hr to
   150-250cc/hr to see how he tolerates b/c BPs are better this AM
   - dose medications for CVVH
   - Follow bladder pressures and lactate
 if continuing to increase
   consider calling surgery to assess for possible decompression of
   compartment syndrome
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day)
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - NPO with IVF
bolus as needed for pressures or give back fluid w CVVH
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   - Consider Insulin in TPN
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are trending down slowly.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, but HIT antibody sent, and subq heparin DCed
   yesterday.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside
   hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150s to 160s systolic, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His general appearance is sedated and intubated, with sclera icteric and scleral edema present. Physical examination findings include small and equal pupils that are slightly reactive to light, supple neck, rhonchorous lungs, soft heart sounds, distended and tympanic abdomen, warm and well-perfused extremities with edema, and pulses that are dopplerable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has also shown positive trends in his blood cultures, urinalysis, and sputum cultures.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxic respiratory failure, likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, gallstone"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with severe GS pancreatitis c/b MOSD.
   Primary issues remain:
         GS pancreatitis
          Resp failure/ARDS
          Septic shock
          hypotension
          fevers
          ARF
          hyperglycemia
          thrombocytopenia
   We are making slow progress with volume removal now able to reduce FIO2
   with some improvement in P:F ratio. Hemodynamics improving as well,
   now off pressors.
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive supportive care for GS
   pancreatitis and MODS.  While he remains very tenuous from resp
   standpoint with high peep and fio2 requirements in setting of ards and
   large distended abd we are making some progress. We will wean fio2
   further following abgs closely.  Tran pl pressure is slightly neg but
   will continue with current level of peep at this time given high plt
   pressures and improvement in pao2.  Pressures will improve further with
   additioanl volume removal though at this time will decrease TV slightly
   as well to help. Will continue ACV w/ ards net TVs, high peep guiding
   with esoph balloon.
   We continue to follow his bladder pressures to monitor for abd
   compartment syndrome as his very distended abd is contributing to his
   high peep needs though additional volume removal will improve this
   further.
   He remains febrile but without leukocytosis. The most likely source of
   his continued temp is severe pancreatitis w/ inflammation.  He is s/p
   ercp with CBD stone removal and stent and his enzymes and lfts are
   trending down.  We continue empiric vanco/zosyn Day 4 with cx data neg
   to date.  Can d/c vanco today given no GPC in any cx
s.  Infection
   parameters are imrpoving but given continued temps will repeat cxr and
   consider repeat abd imaging though would be limited study given no IV
   contrast. His OSH lines were not changed given his very tenuous status,
   though with no new growth from blood will hold on line changes at this
   time.
   He remains on cvvh and we will attempt cotninued increased volume
   removal as BP tolerates maintaining MAPS > 60. he is tolerating this
   well off now pressors. We continue to renally dose meds and avoid
   nephrotoxins. We continue amio gtt  for load, for prior rapid a-fib,
   now in nsr. We have a low suspicion for HIT but suspect his
   thrombocytopenia is related to failed liver and sepsis.  Counts remain
   stable.
   Pt remains very ill with multi organ failure and poor prognosis though
   we are seeing signs of slow improvement.  We continue to update his HCP
   and family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MOSD). He is currently in the ICU and is supported by multiple life-sustaining interventions. The patient's primary issues include respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, hypotension, fevers, acute kidney injury (AKI), hyperglycemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This condition requires mechanical ventilation with high levels of oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

2. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection that leads to low blood pressure and inadequate organ perfusion. He has been receiving vasopressor support but is now off pressors.

3. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which is likely related to septic shock and ARDS. His blood pressure remains low despite being off vasopressors.

4. Fevers: The patient continues to have fevers, which may be due to severe pancreatitis or an ongoing infection. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy, the source of infection remains unclear.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is likely experiencing AKI, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with severe GS pancreatitis c/b MOSD.
   Primary issues remain:
          GS pancreatitis
          Resp failure/ARDS
          Septic shock
          hypotension
          fevers
          ARF
          hyperglycemia
          thrombocytopenia
   We are making slow progress with volume removal, able to come down on
   FIO2 with improvement in P:F ratio. Hemodynamics improving as well, now
   off pressors.
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive supportive care for GS
   pancreatitis and MODS.  While he remains very tenuous from resp
   standpoint with high peep in setting of ards and large distended abd we
   are making progress. Tran pl pressure is slightly neg at end exp, but
   will continue with current level of peep at this time given high plt
   pressures and improvement in pao2.  Airway pressures should improve
   further with additional volume removal.  Will also attempt further
   decrease in TV to help (already on 6cc/kg). If able to tolerate this
   change, well next wean fio2 further following abgs closely.
   We continue to follow his bladder pressures to monitor for abd
   compartment syndrome as his very distended abd is contributing to his
   high peep needs,  This should also improve with volume removal.
   He remains febrile but without leukocytosis. We continue to discuss
   potential infectious etiologies, though the most likely source of his
   continued temp is severe pancreatitis w/ inflammation.  Reassuring is
   his hemodynamic improvement and ability to wean off pressors. He is s/p
   ercp with CBD stone removal and stent and his enzymes and lfts are
   trending down.  Will d/c vanco today given no GPC in any cx
s and
   continue empiric zosyn day 5.  Although we note improvement clinically
   in O2 with volume off, given his continued temps will repeat cxr and
   consider repeat abd imaging though would be limited study given no IV
   contrast. His OSH lines have not been changed since transfer fiven his
   very tenuous status, and with no new growth from blood will hold on
   line changes at this time.
   He remains on cvvh and we will attempt increased volume removal as BP
   tolerates maintaining MAPS > 60.  We continue to renally dose meds and
   avoid nephrotoxins. We continue amio gtt for load, for prior rapid
   a-fib, and he remains in nsr. We have a low suspicion for HIT but
   suspect his thrombocytopenia is related to failed liver and sepsis.
   Counts remain stable.
   Pt remains very ill with multi organ failure and poor prognosis though
   we are seeing signs of slow improvement.  We continue to update his HCP
   and family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with severe acute pancreatitis complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOSD). The patient's primary issues include respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, hypotension, fevers, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperglycemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and has been making slow progress with volume removal. Hemodynamics are improving, and the patient is off pressors. The plan is to continue aggressive supportive care for severe pancreatitis and MODS. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is at risk for further deterioration in lung function due to ARDS. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and continued supportive care are essential.
2. Septic shock: The patient's fever and hypotension indicate possible septic shock. Infection control measures and continued administration of appropriate antibiotics are necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. Monitoring and support with vasopressors may be required.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated serum creatinine and low urine output suggest ARF. Renal replacement therapy may be necessary.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control. Insulin infusion should be continued to maintain tight glyc"

   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio 157. Has had
   difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar recruitment
   maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP, esophageal balloon
   pressures but recently stable in 90s % O2sat w 60% FiO2.  Change of bed
   with 35 degree tilting appeared to help but difficult to do accurate
   CVVH w bed tilted, so he was supine.
   - Concerning as PIP and Plateau pressures are quite high. ( C=P/V)
   Goals to increase compliance: decrease volume with CVVH; Decrease TV to
   400, and if possible decrease peep (unlikely able to decrease this as
   do not want to de-recruit alveoli any further).  Will continue to
   decrease TV slightly as tolerated
   - Decrease FiO2 and check ABGs to get paO2 in 60s for ARDS protocol
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue bed positioning as tolerated to help improve increased
   perfusion to more ventilated areas as will be on CVVH break today
   - line holiday today, so will do lasix trial today with goal -500
   negative today.  Load 100 mg IV lasix, then lasix gtt at 5 mg

    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Weaned off levophed [**9-26**]. Vasopressin
   added this AM for MAPs < 60.
   - lasix gtt trial today
   - continue vasopressin, can turn off if MAPs high in PM
   - trend fever curve and WBC off CVVH
expect some rise in temps off CVVH
   - re-start Vanc 1 g today and will check trough tomorrow for potential
   line infection with skin flora.
   - plan to replace HD line and sub-clavian line tomorrow by IR in angio
   suite if remains stable enough to travel
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx

   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis;
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Cr  up off CVVH.  Likely ATN highest on
   differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  Will hold CVVH today for pus around femoral
   line, plan to re-site lines by IR tomorrow
   - lasix loading dose 100 mg IV then 5 mg gtt

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day)
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs

   increase, will start pro-motility agents, if residuals still high, will
   hold off on tube feeds
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes

   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   - Trial of trophic tube feeds today and attempt to wean down insulin
   gtt
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.

   Seen and examined patient with MS4 and agree with above note. Briefly,
   55 yo male in septic shock [**1-16**] pancreatitis; with ARF and respiratory
   failure slowly improving. Will pull femoral line today and re-start
   vancomycin. Tryi to wean vent settings to decrease plateau pressures
   some. Lasix trial today as CVVH will be on hold today as access and
   machine are not working.

   Problem [**Name (NI) 670**]:
   #Access: patient was a transfer from an outside with severe
   pancreatitis, he had a right subclavian line in place from the outside
   hospital.  On arrival, he was very unstable, and all three lumens of
   his line were needed on admission.  He was initially too unstable for
   any line changes, then he was evaluated by IR for placement of an HD
   line, they were unable to place anything in his neck, and had to place
   the HD line in his right femoral.  He has remained unstable and we have
   unable since his admission to place any lines in his neck, as a result
   his outside hospital line has remained in place.  Since he has remained
   febrile, and there is pus coming from his HD line, that line will be
   pulled today.  Tomorrow, since he is more stable he will go to the IR
   suite for placement of another HD line in his neck, and
   replacement/resiting of the subclavian line.  Throughout his hospital
   course his blood cultures have remained negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis. They are currently in the ICU and on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration) for acute renal failure. The patient also has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and oliguric acute renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/48 mmHg to 165/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on 60% FiO2. The patient's general appearance is sedated and intubated, with sclera icteric and edema present. Pupils are small and equal, and there is no jugular venous distention (JVD) due to neck being thick.

On lung examination, the patient is on a ventilator with anterior lungs being rhonchorous and showing air movement bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular with a rate in the 80s, and soft heart sounds make it difficult to appreciate any murmurs. Abdominal examination reveals no bowel sounds, severe distention, and tympanic abdomen with dullness to percussion at the flanks and inferiorly. Foley catheter is present, and extremities show edema with 1+ pulses dorsalis"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio 157. Has had
   difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar recruitment
   maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP, esophageal balloon
   pressures but recently stable in 90s % O2sat w 60% FiO2.  Change of bed
   with 35 degree tilting appeared to help but difficult to do accurate
   CVVH w bed tilted, so he was supine.
   - Concerning as PIP and Plateau pressures are quite high. ( C=P/V)
   Goals to increase compliance: decrease volume with CVVH; Decrease TV to
   400, and if possible decrease peep (unlikely able to decrease this as
   do not want to de-recruit alveoli any further).  Will continue to
   decrease TV slightly as tolerated
   - Decrease FiO2 and check ABGs to get paO2 in 60s for ARDS protocol
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue bed positioning as tolerated to help improve increased
   perfusion to more ventilated areas as will be on CVVH break today
   - line holiday today, so will do lasix trial today with goal -500
   negative today.  Load 100 mg IV lasix, then lasix gtt at 5 mg
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Weaned off levophed [**9-26**]. Vasopressin
   added this AM for MAPs < 60.
   - lasix gtt trial today
   - continue vasopressin, can turn off if MAPs high in PM
   - trend fever curve and WBC off CVVH
expect some rise in temps off CVVH
   - re-start Vanc 1 g today and will check trough tomorrow for potential
   line infection with skin flora.
   - plan to replace HD line and sub-clavian line tomorrow by IR in angio
   suite if remains stable enough to travel
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx
s and sputum cultures (negative so far)
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis;
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Cr  up off CVVH.  Likely ATN highest on
   differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  Will hold CVVH today for pus around femoral
   line, plan to re-site lines by IR tomorrow
   - lasix loading dose 100 mg IV then 5 mg gtt
   - Renal following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day)
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - nutrition consult to start trophic tube feeds today, if residuals
   increase, will start pro-motility agents, if residuals still high, will
   hold off on tube feeds
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   - Trial of trophic tube feeds today and attempt to wean down insulin
   gtt
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are up slightly today.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, but HIT antibody sent, and subq heparin DCed
   yesterday.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside
   hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma who was transferred to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) and has multiple lines, including a femoral HD line, right subclavian line, left art-line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter. The patient has shown some improvement but still requires close monitoring and management of his various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygenation remains challenging despite high levels of FiO2 and other interventions. There is concern about the possibility of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The goals include decreasing FiO2, maintaining adequate oxygenation, and minimizing ventilator-associated complications.

2. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output remains low, and there is a need to optimize fluid balance and renal function. Lasix trial is planned to promote diuresis and improve renal perfusion. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be necessary if CVVH is not effective.

3. Septic Shock: The patient's blood pressure remains unstable, and vasopressor support is required. There is a focus on weaning off vasopressors and managing potential sources of infection, such as line-related infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio 157. Has had
   difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar recruitment
   maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP, esophageal balloon
   pressures but recently stable in 90s % O2sat w 60% FiO2.  Change of bed
   with 35 degree tilting appeared to help but difficult to do accurate
   CVVH w bed tilted, so he was supine.
   - Concerning as PIP and Plateau pressures are quite high. ( C=P/V)
   Goals to increase compliance: decrease volume with CVVH; Decrease TV to
   400, and if possible decrease peep (unlikely able to decrease this as
   do not want to de-recruit alveoli any further).  Will continue to
   decrease TV slightly as tolerated
   - Decrease FiO2 and check ABGs to get paO2 in 60s for ARDS protocol
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue bed positioning as tolerated to help improve increased
   perfusion to more ventilated areas as will be on CVVH break today
   - line holiday today, so will do lasix trial today with goal -500
   negative today.  Load 100 mg IV lasix, then lasix gtt at 5 mg
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Weaned off levophed [**9-26**]. Vasopressin
   added this AM for MAPs < 60.
   - lasix gtt trial today
   - continue vasopressin, can turn off if MAPs high in PM
   - trend fever curve and WBC off CVVH
expect some rise in temps off CVVH
   - re-start Vanc 1 g today and will check trough tomorrow for potential
   line infection with skin flora.
   - plan to replace HD line and sub-clavian line tomorrow by IR in angio
   suite if remains stable enough to travel
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx
s and sputum cultures (negative so far)
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis;
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Cr  up off CVVH.  Likely ATN highest on
   differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.
   - Continue CVVH to get fluids off
 increase rate from 150cc/hr to
   150-250cc/hr to see how he tolerates b/c BPs are better this AM
   - dose medications for CVVH
   - Follow bladder pressures and lactate
 if continuing to increase
   consider calling surgery to assess for possible decompression of
   compartment syndrome
   - Renal following: will ask if lasix trial is suitable yet.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day)
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - NPO with IVF

   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   - Consider Insulin in TPN and attempt to wean down insulin gtt

   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). The patient has multiple complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and he is dependent on vasopressors to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP). There is a concern for ongoing sepsis due to positive fever curve and white blood cell count. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and organ function is essential.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has difficulty maintaining oxygenation, and there are concerns about acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oxygenation should be closely monitored, and adjustments to ventilator settings and bed positioning should be made as needed.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired renal function. CVVH is being used to manage fluid balance and remove waste products. Frequent monitoring of renal function, fluid balance, and electrolytes is necessary.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in sinus rhythm, but there"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis that led to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, likely associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as indicated by a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio. He is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube and is on mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode. The goal is to maintain oxygenation while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury.

The patient also has ongoing hypotension and septic shock, despite being weaned off vasopressor support. His blood pressure is currently being managed with CVVH, and anti-hypertensive medications may be considered if necessary.

The patient has acute renal failure, with elevated creatinine levels. CVVH has been initiated and will continue to remove fluids and help improve renal function. The rate of CVVH will be increased to 150-250cc/hr to assess tolerance.

Additionally, the patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving amiodarone. His heart rate needs to be maintained below 120 beats per minute to improve cardiac output and perfusion.

The patient's gallstone pancreatitis is improving, with"

   55M with severe GS pancreatitis c/b MOSD.
   Primary issues remain:
          severe GS pancreatitis
          Resp failure/ARDS
          hypotension
          fevers
          ARF
          hyperglycemia
          thrombocytopenia (improving)
              anemia
   Pt remains very tenuous. He continues to have temps, more notable as
   CVVH is on hold. His wbc count is up slightly today.  His MAPS have
   dropped intermittently, though this is in the context of sig volume
   removal over the past few days.  He is back on vasopressin this am. His
   FIO2 is down overall, now back at 60% though this was increased
   transiently as well in the setting of desatturation. His lactate
   remains wnl. We remain concerned for evolving infection, recurrent
   sepsis, though volume/fluid shifts may be contributing to some extent
   to his hypotension.  His pancreatic and lft continue to decrease and
   ruq us gb yesterday demonstrated no new acute process.
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive supportive care for GS
   pancreatitis and MODS.
   --He remains very tenuous from resp standpoint in setting of severe
   ards and distended abd.  We have been making are making slow progress
   in terms of oxygen requirements and will wean O2 further as able.  We
   continue with current high PEEP, noting his esoph balloon is now out.
   His compliance remains very poor with elevated Plt and PIPs.  We made a
   little progress in his plt pressures yesterday by reducing his TV
   further, but they remain high.  We will come down a little more today
   and follow allowing permissive hypercapnea.  He is well sedated without
   dysynchrony with the vent and I do not think paralysis will have a big
   effect.  We could try PCV next.  We hope that additional volume removal
   will help further.  We have followed his bladder pressures and while
   there is no evidence at present of abd compartment syndrome, though his
   abd distention is contributing to his high peep needs.
   --His ongoing temps may be [**1-16**] his underlying
   pancreatitis/inflammation. We continue to discuss other potential
   infection etiologies. Now his wbc ct  is slightly and his BP down, back
   on pressors.  We note new pus draining at his HD line site, raising our
   suspicion for line infection.  We will d/c his HD line, sending tip for
   cx.  Will add back vanco and we otherwise continue zosyn Day 6.  Will
   give line holiday and plan for IR placed HD line as well as CVL change
   tomorrow.  Esoph balloon is out and we follow up pending cx data noting
   purulence from nostril.  Will consider imaging his sinuses. We will
   continue to follow abd exam and consider repeat belly imaging.  His
   pancreatic enzymes and lfts are improving.
   --In terms of his recurrent pressor requirement, suspect this is [**1-16**]
   volume shifts and probably infection.  Less likely cardiac. His cvp is
   tanked.  As BP tolerates, we will stop pressors, maintain MAPS > 65.
   Will trend lactate which has remained wnl.  We continue amio gtt to
   complete his 10 gm load, for prior rapid a-fib.  He remains in nsr.
   --CVVH on hold today due to line issues as above. Will trial lasix gtt
   and assess for response.  We continue to renally dose meds and avoid
   nephrotoxins.
   -Will hold on tpn today pending line replacement.  Noting minimal OG
   outpt we will start trophic TFs.
   -Pt remains very ill with multi organ failure and poor prognosis. We
   continue to update his HCP and family.
   Remainder as per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOSD). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and remains very tenuous. The primary issues include severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, fever, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia (improving), anemia, and potential evolving infection.

The patient has been experiencing temperatures, with a slightly elevated white blood cell count today. His mean arterial pressure (MAP) has intermittently dropped, possibly due to significant volume removal over the past few days. He is back on vasopressin this morning, and his fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) has been decreased overall, now at 60%. His lactate levels remain within normal limits.

There is concern for recurrent sepsis and evolving infection, although fluid shifts may also contribute to his hypotension. Pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests (LFTs) continue to decrease, and a recent right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound showed no new acute process.

The patient's respiratory status remains critical in the setting of severe ARDS and abdominal distention. There has been slow progress in terms of oxygen requirements, and weaning of O2 will continue as able. High positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is being maintained, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with severe GS pancreatitis c/b MOSD.
   Primary issues remain:
          GS pancreatitis
          Resp failure/ARDS
          Septic shock
          hypotension
          fevers
          ARF
          hyperglycemia
          thrombocytopenia
   He remains with low grade temps.  After sig volume removal his MAPs
   decreased and he was restarted on vasopressin this am.  He tolerated
   drop in fio2 yestersday but is now back up to 60% though overall better
   oxyegnation than several days back. Hypotenive overnight--lactate wnl.
   Suspect [**1-16**] volume shifts.  Now on vasopressin
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive supportive care for GS
   pancreatitis and MODS.  He remains very tenuous from resp standpoint
   with high peep in setting of ards and distended abd we are making slow
   progress.Will wean o2 as able, continuing current level of high peep.
   Plt and PIPs remain elevated despite decreaing TVs.
    Tran pl pressure is slightly neg at end exp, but will continue with
   current level of peep at this time given high plt pressures and
   improvement in pao2.  Airway pressures should improve further with
   additional volume removal.  Will also attempt further decrease in TV to
   help (already on 6cc/kg). If able to tolerate this change, well next
   wean fio2 further following abgs closely.
   We continue to follow his bladder pressures to monitor for abd
   compartment syndrome as his very distended abd is contributing to his
   high peep needs,  This should also improve with volume removal.
   He remains febrile, now off CVVH with temps increasing.  his wbc is now
   up slightly. HD line now with pus at crease and entry point. Plan for
   IR changed HD line.  Will recx, send line tip for cx amnd resume vanco
   empirically for possible HD line inf checking trough prior to redoisng
   as this was stopped recently.  Other potentially etiologies include
   sinusitis given nasal drainiage,.  cx from swab pending.  if after line
   removal fevers continuje consider head CT.  His lefts continue to
   decrese and cxr without new obvious abnl with overall trend of
   improving oxygenation. His OPSH line site.  Will continue zosyn.  Will
   hold off on repeating abd imaging at this time. We continue to discuss
   potential infectious etiologies, though the most likely source of his
   continued temp is severe pancreatitis w/ inflammation.  Reassuring is
   his hemodynamic improvement and ability to wean off pressors. He is s/p
   ercp with CBD stone removal and stent and his enzymes and lfts are
   trending down.  Will d/c vanco today given no GPC in any cx
s and
   continue empiric zosyn day 5.  Although we note improvement clinically
   in O2 with volume off, given his continued temps will repeat cxr and
   consider repeat abd imaging though would be limited study given no IV
   contrast. His OSH lines have not been changed since transfer fiven his
   very tenuous status, and with no new growth from blood will hold on
   line changes at this time.
   As his CCVVH line is now kined and now urgent need for CVVH today -->
   will need replacement.  Will give line holiday today w/ plan for IR
   reolacement tomorrow.  Will also dsicuss IR repolacing neck line at
   time of procedure.  We continue to renally dose meds and avoid
   nephrotoxins. will trial lasix gtt as BP tolerates.
   We continue amio gtt for load, for prior rapid a-fib, and he remains in
   nsr. We have a low suspicion for HIT but suspect his thrombocytopenia
   is related to failed liver and sepsis.  Counts remain stable.
    Will hold on tpn today pending line replacement. Will begin tropphic
   TFs given min OG outpt.
   Pt remains very ill with multi organ failure and poor prognosis though
   we are seeing signs of slow improvement.  We continue to update his HCP
   and family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with severe acute pancreatitis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperglycemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 26 cmH2O. His blood pressure is stable but requires vasopressin support. He has had an ERCP with CBD stone removal and stent placement, and his pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests are trending down. The patient's condition remains tenuous, and there are concerns about potential complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and possible HIT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's distended abdomen and high plateau pressures indicate the possibility of increased intra-abdominal pressure, which can compromise organ perfusion and function.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infections: The presence of pus at the site of the HD line entry point and the patient's fevers suggest a possible catheter-related infection. Changing the line and sending the tip for culture is planned.
3. Hepatic involvement: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) may indicate liver dysfunction, which can be associated with severe pancreatitis and MODS.
4. Renal involvement: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio 157. Has had
   difficulty maintaining oxygenation, despite alveolar recruitment
   maneuvers, positioning of bed, very elevated PEEP, esophageal balloon
   pressures but recently stable in 90s % O2sat w 60% FiO2.  Change of bed
   with 35 degree tilting appeared to help but difficult to do accurate
   CVVH w bed tilted, so he was supine.
   - Concerning as PIP and Plateau pressures are quite high. ( C=P/V)
   Goals to increase compliance: decrease volume with CVVH; Decrease TV to
   400, and if possible decrease peep (unlikely able to decrease this as
   do not want to de-recruit alveoli any further).  Will continue to
   decrease TV slightly as tolerated
   - Decrease FiO2 and check ABGs to get paO2 in 60s for ARDS protocol
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue bed positioning as tolerated to help improve increased
   perfusion to more ventilated areas as will be on CVVH break today
   - line holiday today, so will do lasix trial today with goal -500
   negative today.  Load 100 mg IV lasix, then lasix gtt at 5 mg
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Weaned off levophed [**9-26**]. Vasopressin
   added this AM for MAPs < 60.
   - lasix gtt trial today
   - continue vasopressin, can turn off if MAPs high in PM
   - trend fever curve and WBC off CVVH
expect some rise in temps off CVVH
   - re-start Vanc 1 g today and will check trough tomorrow for potential
   line infection with skin flora.
   - plan to replace HD line and sub-clavian line tomorrow by IR in angio
   suite if remains stable enough to travel
   - f/u  blood cultures, Ucx
s and sputum cultures (negative so far)
   - Zosyn, renally dosed due to concern for possible cholangitis;
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Cr  up off CVVH.  Likely ATN highest on
   differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  Will hold CVVH today for pus around femoral
   line, plan to re-site lines by IR tomorrow
   - lasix loading dose 100 mg IV then 5 mg gtt
   - Renal following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day)
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - nutrition consult to start trophic tube feeds today, if residuals
   increase, will start pro-motility agents, if residuals still high, will
   hold off on tube feeds
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now.
   - Trial of trophic tube feeds today and attempt to wean down insulin
   gtt
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are up slightly today.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, but HIT antibody sent, and subq heparin DCed
   yesterday.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside
   hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, which has led to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty maintaining oxygenation despite various interventions. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the goal is to improve oxygenation while minimizing further lung injury.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressor support. The source of infection should be identified and treated appropriately to control septic shock.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. CVVH has been initiated and will continue with a plan to restart hemodialysis (HD) line tomorrow.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which may be related to hospital-acquired thrombocytopenia or medications. Monitoring of platelet levels and trend analysis is ongoing.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level has decreased, and he may require blood transfusion if it drops below 25%.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating possible diabetes"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio 99.
   Ventilation per ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep
   plateau pressures low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370,
   PEEP 22, FiO2 50% although with desaturations on
   movement/rotation/stimulation to 80s requiring transient increase in
   FiO2.  Sedation increased due to overbreathing on vent and need to
   ventilate at lower TVs, which were not tolerated on decreased sedation.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - will likely need increased FiO2/PEEP for IR procedure today.
   Re-check gas once back from IR and continue to manage vent settings
   according to ARDS net goals.
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue bed positioning as tolerated to help improve increased
   perfusion to more ventilated areas while on CVVH break today
   - restart CVVHDF once access obtained to remove volume.  Respiratory
   status will likely benefit from volume removal.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  On vasopressin and levophed.
   Intermittently has required phenylephrine to maintain MAPs >60.
   Continues to spike low grade temps, most likely source at this point is
   line infection.  On zosyn for concern for cholangitis given
   infected-appearing bile by ERCP.  Re-started Vanc [**9-28**] for suspected
   line infection, although vanc trough was therapeutic even after vanc
   was originally d/c
   - re-site HD and subclavian lines by IR today.  Replace A-line once
   back from IR.  Culture all tips.
   - foley changed yesterday
   - continue vanc and zosyn for now.
   - f/u culture data.
   - continue vasopressin.  levophed and phenylephrine PRN for MAPs < 60.
   Goal MAP > 65.  Will likely require some pressure support for IR
   procedure today.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  BUN/Cr/K/PO4 up off CVVH.  Likely ATN highest
   on differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  D/c
d [**9-27**] overnight for line kinking and
   pustular drainage around line.
   - restart CVVHDF after access today
   - Renal following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day)
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], NPO for procedure [**9-29**], will re-start
   and advance as tolerated
   - re-start TPN once access achieved after IR procedure for now with
   plan to bridge to full tube feeds
   - Trend his LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now given changes in TPN/tube feeds.
   - Trial of trophic tube feeds today and attempt to wean down insulin
   gtt
   - will calculate 24 hour insulin needs once on stable tube feeds and
   transition to long-acting regimen
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased to 31 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  His platelets are up slightly today.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, but HIT antibody sent, and subq heparin DCed
   yesterday.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside
   hospital admission)
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 89/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 70% FiO2. The patient is sedated and intubated, with a tracheostomy in place. His general appearance is described as sedated and intubated, with no response to voice but responsive to suction.

On examination, the patient has scleral icterus and edema, pupils that are small and equal, and slightly reactive to light. His neck is supple, but jugular venous distention (JVD) is difficult to assess due to neck edema. His lung examination reveals bilateral anterior lung fields with improved breath sounds and air movement bilaterally. His heart examination shows a regular rhythm, soft heart sounds, and no murmurs appreciated. His abdomen is distended and tympanic, with dullness to percussion at the flanks and inferiorly. His extremities are edematous, with 1+ pulses distal to the fem"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with severe GS pancreatitis c/b MOSD.
   Primary issues remain:
          severe GS pancreatitis
          Resp failure/ARDS
          hypotension
          fevers
              leukocytosis
          ARF
          hyperglycemia
          thrombocytopenia (improving)
              anemia
   Pt remains critically ill with multi organ failure and poor prognosis.
   He is septic, continues to have temps and now his wbc count is rising
   steadily and he is back on more pressors.  We are treating for an HD
   line infection noting pus at the entry site, line now out.  With his
   WBC count so high, c diff also of high concern. His lft and a/l are
   down and recent RUQ unimpressive and cxs have been unrevealing to date.
   We have discussed other possible infectious etiologies including
   sinuisitis, though nasal drainage has stopped and his esoph balloon
   removed. There is no change in airway secretions or obvious new
   infiltrate on cxr and his increasing FIO2 from yesterday can be
   explained by volume with cvvh held.  He remains very tenuous from resp
   standpoint in setting of severe ards c/b ARF/volume overload and
   distended abd.  Some of his hypotension and pressor needs could be
   related to volume overload
he may be far off his starling curve that we
   hope to again see some further improvement once he is back on cvvh.
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive supportive care for GS
   pancreatitis and MODS.
   --We will wean fio2 further as we are able once back on cvvh, if he
   tolerates volume off.  He remains on low TVs with permissive
   hypercapnea noting some improvement in plt pressures with this
   reduction as well as drop the slight peep decrease to 22.
   --We have followed his bladder pressures and while there is no evidence
   at present of abd compartment syndrome, though his abd distention is
   contributing to his high peep needs.
   --He remains on zosyn and vanco.  His HD line was pulled. Plan for IR
   resiting of his HD and his CVL.  We will change out his a-aline today.
   We will resend stool for c diff, u/a and continue to follow pending cx
   data.
   --Would consider ct chest, abd, sinuses if no improvement after line
   changes.
   --As BP tolerates, we will wean pressors maintain MAPS > 65. Will trend
   lactate which has remained wnl.  We continue amio gtt to complete his
   10 gm load, for prior rapid a-fib.  He remains in nsr.
   --CVVH will resume after line placement. We continue to renally dose
   meds accordingly and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - We continue to update his HCP and family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient's primary issues remain severe gallstone pancreatitis, respiratory failure/ARDS, hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, ARF, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and poor prognosis. The patient is critically ill with multiorgan failure and has a high likelihood of sepsis, as indicated by the presence of fever and rising white blood cell count. 

The patient has been treated for an infection in the hemodialysis (HD) line, and the line has been removed due to pus at the entry site. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, making C. diff infection a concern. 

The patient's left and alkaline phosphatase levels are decreasing, and recent right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound was unimpressive. Chest X-rays have not revealed any new findings, and there is no change in airway secretions or obvious new infiltrate.

The patient remains very tenuous from a respiratory standpoint in the setting"

          fevers
          ARF

              anemia
   Pt remains very tenuous. He continues to have temps. His wbc con
t to
   rising.He is needing more pressors though still only low amts of
   elvophed + vasopressin.  Some of this may be related to new
   lineninfection/sepsis noting pus at HD line site line no out.  He is so
   far off his starling curve that we may also see some further
   improvement oncw he is back on cvvh if we are able to remove fluids.
    His MAPS have dropped intermittently, though this is in the context of
   sig volume removal over the past few days.  He is back on vasopressin
   this am. His FIO2 is down overall, now back at 60% though this was
   increased transiently as well in the setting of desatturation. His
   lactate remains wnl. We remain concerned for evolving infection,
   recurrent sepsis, though volume/fluid shifts may be contributing to
   some extent to his hypotension.  His pancreatic and lft continue to
   decrease and ruq us gb yesterday demonstrated no new acute process.
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive supportive care for GS
   pancreatitis and MODS.
   --He remains very tenuous from resp standpoint in setting of severe
   ards and distended abd.  We will wean fio2 further as we are able once
   back on cvvh, if he tolerates volume off.  He remains on low TVs with
   permissive hypercapnea noting some improvement in plt pressures with
   this reduction as well as drop in peep to 22.
   We have been making are making slow progress in terms of oxygen
   requirements and will wean O2 further as able.  We continue with
   current high PEEP, noting his esoph balloon is now out. His compliance
   remains very poor with elevated Plt and PIPs.  We made a little
   progress in his plt pressures yesterday by reducing his TV further, but
   they remain high.  We will come down a little more today and follow
   allowing permissive hypercapnea.  He is well sedated without
   dysynchrony with the vent and I do not think paralysis will have a big
   effect.  We could try PCV next.  We hope that additional volume removal
   will help further.  We have followed his bladder pressures and while
   there is no evidence at present of abd compartment syndrome, though his
   abd distention is contributing to his high peep needs.
   --His ongoing temps may be [**1-16**] his underlying
   pancreatitis/inflammation.  Also with probable new line infection.  We
   continue to discuss other potential infection etiologies. He is on
   zosyn and now back on vanco.  His HD line is out.  Plan for IR resiting
   his line and resite his CVL.  We continue to montior cx
d though with
   no new growth to date from urine, blood, sptuum, or stool.
   Now his wbc ct  is slightly and his BP down, back on pressors.  We note
   new pus draining at his HD line site, raising our suspicion for line
   infection.  We will d/c his HD line, sending tip for cx.  Will add back
   vanco and we otherwise continue zosyn Day 6.  Will give line holiday
   and plan for IR placed HD line as well as CVL change tomorrow.  Esoph
   balloon is out and we follow up pending cx data noting purulence from
   nostril.  Will consider imaging his sinuses. We will continue to follow
   abd exam and consider repeat belly imaging.  His pancreatic enzymes and
   lfts are improving.  Will change a-line site, as I now realize this too
   was placed at OSH.
   --In terms of his recurrent pressor requirement, suspect this is [**1-16**]
   volume shifts and probably infection. Attempt to wean pressors as we
   are able after line placment, and as CVVH is resumed.
   Less likely cardiac. His cvp is tanked.  As BP tolerates, we will stop
   pressors, maintain MAPS > 65. Will trend lactate which has remained
   wnl.  We continue amio gtt to complete his 10 gm load, for prior rapid
   a-fib.  He remains in nsr.
   --CVVH on hold today due to line issues as above with plan to resume.
   Will trial lasix gtt and assess for response.  We continue to renally
   dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   -Pt remains very ill with multi organ failure and poor prognosis. We
   continue to update his HCP and family.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOSD). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is also experiencing hypotension, fever, acute kidney injury (ARF), hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and rising white blood cell count.

The patient's condition remains tenuous, and he is at high risk for infection and recurrent sepsis. He is receiving multiple vasopressors to maintain blood pressure, and his oxygen requirements are gradually being weaned off. The patient's pancreatic and liver enzymes are decreasing, but he continues to have poor respiratory compliance and elevated platelet pressures.

There are concerns about possible linen infection or sepsis, as pus is noted at the site of the hemodialysis line. The patient's central venous catheter (CVC) tip culture is positive for yeast, indicating a possible line infection. The plan is to remove the current HD line and send the tip for culture. An interventional radiology (IR) procedure will be performed to change the HD line and resite the CVL. 

The patient's abdominal distention may contribute to his high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) needs. His blood pressure and lactate levels are being monitored closely, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with severe GS pancreatitis c/b MOSD.
   Primary issues remain:
          severe GS pancreatitis
          Resp failure/ARDS
          hypotension
          fevers
              leukocytosis
          ARF
          hyperglycemia
          thrombocytopenia (improving)
              anemia
   Pt remains critically ill with multi organ failure and poor prognosis.
   He is septic, continues to have temps and now his wbc count is rising
   steadily and he is back on more pressors.  We are treating for an HD
   line infection noting pus at the entry site, line now out.  With his
   WBC count so high, c diff also of high concern. His lft and a/l are
   down and recent RUQ unimpressive and cxs have been unrevealing to date.
   We have discussed other possible infectious etiologies including
   sinuisitis, though nasal drainage has stopped and his esoph balloon
   removed. There is no change in airway secretions or obvious new
   infiltrate on cxr and his increasing FIO2 from yesterday can be
   explained by volume with cvvh held.  He remains very tenuous from resp
   standpoint in setting of severe ards c/b ARF/volume overload and
   distended abd.  Some of his hypotension and pressor needs could be
   related to volume overload
he may be far off his starling curve that we
   hope to again see some further improvement once he is back on cvvh.
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive supportive care for GS
   pancreatitis and MODS.
   --We will wean fio2 further as we are able once back on cvvh, if he
   tolerates volume off.  He remains on low TVs with permissive
   hypercapnea noting some improvement in plt pressures with this
   reduction as well as drop the slight peep decrease to 22.
   --We have followed his bladder pressures and while there is no evidence
   at present of abd compartment syndrome, though his abd distention is
   contributing to his high peep needs.
   --He remains on zosyn and vanco.  His HD line was pulled. Plan for IR
   resiting of his HD and his CVL.  We will change out his a-aline today.
   We will resend stool for c diff, u/a and continue to follow pending cx
   data.
   --Would consider ct chest, abd, sinuses if no improvement after line
   changes.
   --As BP tolerates, we will wean pressors maintain MAPS > 65. Will trend
   lactate which has remained wnl.  We continue amio gtt to complete his
   10 gm load, for prior rapid a-fib.  He remains in nsr.
   --CVVH will resume after line placement. We continue to renally dose
   meds accordingly and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - We continue to update his HCP and family.
   Remainder as per resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and hyperglycemia. The patient remains critically ill with multi-organ failure and poor prognosis. He is septic, has fevers, leukocytosis, hypotension, and is at high risk for Clostridium difficile infection due to his high white blood cell count.

The patient's primary issues include severe gallstone pancreatitis, respiratory failure/ARDS, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, AKI, hyperglycemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's condition is complicated by a potential central venous catheter infection, evidenced by pus at the entry site and elevated white blood cell count.

The patient's respiratory status is tenuous in the setting of severe ARDS caused by AKI, volume overload, and abdominal distention. The patient is on aggressive supportive care for gallstone pancreatitis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is septic, and there is a concern for a central venous catheter infection. He also has a high risk of Clostridium difficile infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe ARDS and continues to require significant respiratory support.
3. Acute kidney injury: The"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - CVVH --? rate was increased from 50cc/hr to 200cc/hr... and levophed
   was titrated down.  CVVH rate later had to be decreased back down.
   CVVH filter clotted up again after 8 hrs (should last 3 days); not
   using citrate this time, but clotted up easily even w citrate last
   time.
   - vanc trough in AM
   - continues on amio gtt load--> should have had about 6gm of loading
   dose by today
   - consider advancing trophic feeds while restarting TPN; can DC TPN
   after he reaches goal for trophic feeds however long it takes
   - updated HCP about line infections, new lines, CVVH, etc-- he wanted
   to definitely meet w doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9466**] (he can call Monday to set up a
   time) to talk about goals of care and branchpoint decisions
   - Night nurse has concern about re-addressing code status to reverse it
   back to FULL CODE possibly if patient continues to make big
   improvements w CVVH
   - FiO2 titrated down to 90% but has much room to keep titrating down.

   plateau pressures low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.
   S/P IR procedure yesterday likely derecruited a lot of lung as patient
   is on higher FiO2 requirements and higher PEEP. Patient slowly
   improving, but still on very high settings to maintain appropriate
   oxygen levels.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 80% and check ABG.
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue bed positioning as tolerated to help improve increased
   perfusion to more ventilated areas while on CVVH break today
   - restart CVVHDF once access obtained to remove volume.  Respiratory
   status will likely benefit from volume removal.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  On vasopressin and levophed to maintain
   appropriate MAPs. Continues to spike low grade temps with increasing
   WBC. Most likely source at this point is line infection, although
   removal of lines and treatment has not changed patient
s clinical
   status.  Was on Zosyn for x days, but overnight changed to meropenem
   for broader coverage.  Re-started Vanc [**9-28**] for suspected line
   infection. Other sources: VAP (unable to see on CXR in setting of
   ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and has had no
   more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is unlikely as RUQ u/s
   negative and enzymes are all trending down. C. diff possibility
   (previous was negative) possible DVT, but unlikely to cause significant
   wbc.
   - if patient
s respiratory status improves consider CT of
   abdomen/chest.
   - continue vanc and meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]) for now.  (Vanc Trough
   22.2 this AM)
   - Vanc trough this PM before dosage: should dose all Abx with a CrCl of
   < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - Will double cover for pseudomonas with Cipro (day 1: [**2169-9-30**])

   on differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  D/c
d [**9-27**] overnight for line kinking and
   pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**] as new IR lines
   placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging filter. Concern that
   patient may be a bit intravascularly depleted and the HD catheter is
   sucking against the wall of the vessel causing alarms to sound.
   - Will give albumin today with CVVH to help mobilize some extravascular
   space into intravascular compartment.
   - Ensure technical difficulties are addressed and fixed so CVVH can
   continue

   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now given changes in TPN/tube feeds.
   - Trial of trophic tube feeds today and attempt to wean down insulin

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, atrial fibrillation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and potential infections such as line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and sinusitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates severe hypoxemia, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially ventilator-associated lung injury.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN, creatinine, and potassium levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Septic shock: The patient's persistent fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count indicate ongoing infection and sepsis. This can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and potentially death if not promptly treated.
4. Line infection: The presence of pus around the femoral line and elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible line infection, which can be a source of bloodstream infection and sepsis.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The"

   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio 99.
   Ventilation per ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep
   plateau pressures low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370,
   PEEP 22, FiO2 50% although with desaturations on
   movement/rotation/stimulation to 80s requiring transient increase in
   FiO2.  Sedation increased due to overbreathing on vent and need to
   ventilate at lower TVs, which were not tolerated on decreased sedation.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.

 Renal failure
   - CVVH circuit down, may be due to more aggressive volume removal
   - will remove volume cautiously today but goal negative
Atrial fibrillation
   - on amiodarone drip, will continue at 0.5 until GI motility improved

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and pancreatitis. He was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis, shock, and respiratory failure. Currently, the patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and persistent significant hypoxemia despite high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.

The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. He is on multiple medications including vasopressin, insulin, amiodarone, fentanyl, norepinephrine, and midazolam. The patient also has a central line, hemodialysis catheter, arterial line, and a new multilumen central line placed.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/53 mmHg to 152/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 90% FiO2.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated, with pupils that are constricted and minimally reactive. There is no wheezing appreciated in the pulmonary examination. The patient has distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds and no grimace with palpation. He also has diffuse slight edema, particularly in the sacral area, and peripheral pulses are intact.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine,"

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and pancreatitis. He was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis, shock, and respiratory failure. The patient now has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and persistent significant hypoxemia requiring high PEEP and FiO2. The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation.

24-hour events include the placement of a new hemodialysis (HD) and central line, as well as the initiation of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's condition has been unstable, with increased residuals and a filter clog in the CVVH circuit.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including vasopressin, insulin, amiodarone, fentanyl, norepinephrine, and midazolam. He also receives pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 100/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient's weight is 135.4 kg, and he has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 19 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,640 mL and output of 1,891 mL.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 158.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  S/P IR procedure
   Friday likely derecruited a lot of lung as patient was initially on
   higher FiO2 and higher PEEP. Patient slowly improving, with FiO2 40%
   but still with high PEEP.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - Maintain FiO2 to 40% and decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain paO2
   > 60
consider increasing FiO2 rather than increasing PEEP more.
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated and increase rate of fluid loss as
   tolerated.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  On vasopressin and levophed to maintain
   appropriate MAPs. Continues to spike low grade temps on CVVH. WBC
   improved. Unable to find source at this point. Lines changed [**9-29**].
   Was on Zosyn initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro and vanc
   for broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP (unable to see on CXR in
   setting of ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and
   has had no more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a
   possibility, but RUQ u/s negative for achalculous cholecystitis.
   Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff possibility (previous was
   negative). Overall, unclear picture of source even though infection is
   likely given clinical picture.
   - if patient
s respiratory status improves consider CT of abdomen/chest
   and possibly sinuses.
   - continue vanc and meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]) for now.  (Vanc Trough
   20.1 in PM) Continue cipro (Day 1: [**2169-9-30**])
   - Vanc trough this AM before dosage: should dose all Abx with a CrCl of
   < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - Check C. diff today (negative x 1 so far)
   - Lactate normal
   - continue vasopressin.  levophed for MAPs < 65.  Wean down as
   tolerated
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed [**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - Consider ID consult if no source of infection can be found on CT.
   - Perform sputum blood culture and sputum culture today as this should
   be done q 3 days in the ICU if no source is found.
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  BUN/Cr/K/PO4 up off CVVH.  Likely ATN highest
   on differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  D/c
d [**9-27**] overnight for line kinking and
   pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**] as new IR lines
   placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging filter. Re-started
   yesterday without any significant problems. Also given albumin with
   CVVH yesterday which appeared to be equivical.
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. If patient
   becomes too hypotensive, change rate as net even rather than negative.
   - Renal following
   - Will discuss with renal the possibility of contrast in CT scan, if
   occurs tomorrow.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of XXX grams as of 0800 this AM.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs if any
   - Surgery has signed off.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals. Hold
   tube feeds for now in setting of decreased bowel sounds.
   - TPN for now
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Trophic tube feeds held due to high residuals. Hold for now.
   - Continue insulin gtt in setting of infection
   - Insulin in TPN.
   - will calculate 24 hour insulin needs if able to maintain stable tube
   feeds and transition to long-acting regimen
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct  29.9 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved. His platelets are up to 237 today.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody could not be sent as does not meet
   criteria for diagnosis, and subq heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside hospital admission)
   - Since plts are normalized,
   - Continue Heparin sub q.
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Trophic tube feeds attempted three  times all with high
   residuals.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  ARDS likely as p/f ratio 158.
   Ventilation per ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep
   plateau pressures low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.
   S/P IR procedure Friday likely derecruited a lot of lung as patient was
   initially on higher FiO2 and higher PEEP. Patient slowly improving,
   with FiO2 40% but still with high PEEP.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - Maintain FiO2 to 40% and decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain paO2
   > 60
consider increasing FiO2 rather than increasing PEEP more.
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated and increase rate of fluid loss as
   tolerated.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  On vasopressin and levophed to maintain
   appropriate MAPs. Continues to spike low grade temps with increasing
   WBC. Most likely source at this point is line infection, although
   removal of lines and treatment has not changed patient
s clinical
   status.  Was on Zosyn initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro
   and vanc for broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP (unable to see on
   CXR in setting of ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for
   this and has had no more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is
   unlikely as RUQ u/s negative and enzymes are all trending down. C. diff
   possibility (previous was negative) possible DVT, but unlikely to cause
   significant wbc.
   - if patient
s respiratory status improves consider CT of
   abdomen/chest.
   - continue vanc and meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]) for now.  (Vanc Trough
   20.1 in PM) Continue cipro (Day 1: [**2169-9-30**])
   - Vanc trough this PM before dosage: should dose all Abx with a CrCl of
   < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - Check C. diff today (negative x 1 so far)
   - Lactate normal at 1.7
   - continue vasopressin.  levophed for MAPs < 65.  Wean down as
   tolerated
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed [**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - Consider ID consult as no known source of infection has been found.
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  BUN/Cr/K/PO4 up off CVVH.  Likely ATN highest
   on differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  D/c
d [**9-27**] overnight for line kinking and
   pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**] as new IR lines
   placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging filter. Re-started
   yesterday without any significant problems. Also given albumin with
   CVVH yesterday.
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated
   - Ensure technical difficulties are addressed and fixed so CVVH can
   continue
   - Renal following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) Currently received a
   total of XXX grams as of 0800 this AM.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs
   - Will f/u surgery recs.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], advance as tolerated
   - TPN until tube feeds are at goal
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now given changes in TPN/tube feeds.
   - Trial of trophic tube feeds today and attempt to wean down insulin
   gtt
   - will calculate 24 hour insulin needs once on stable tube feeds and
   transition to long-acting regimen
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct  31 (from 52 at OSH when hemoconcentrated)
   but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved. His platelets are up to 237 today.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody could not be sent as does not meet
   criteria for diagnosis, and subq heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside hospital admission)
   - Since plts are normalized, will re-start Heparin sub q.
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Trophic tube feeds attempted three  times all with high
   residuals.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). 

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure (ARDS), hypotension/Septic Shock, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and gallstone pancreatitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure (ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a goal PaO2 > 60 and plateau pressures < 40. Close monitoring and adjustment of FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient is on vasopressin and norepinephrine to maintain appropriate mean arterial pressures (MAPs). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and the source of infection is still being sought. If the patient's respiratory status improves, a CT of the abdomen/chest may be considered.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on CVVH with tolerable fluid loss. Technical difficulties with the CVVH should be addressed promptly. Renal function will be followed closely.

   Assessment and Plan
 ARDS
   - improved over past 24 hours, Fi02 down to 40%, likely due to volume
   removal
   - will continue to very slowly wean PEEP and follow gases
   - continues to have very high plateaus, which is concerning
   - if unable to come down on PEEP further due to oxygenation, will
   decreased TV to 350
 Shock
   - likely septic, though no clear pathogen identified, ongoing fever;
   all lines re-sited 10.16
   - levo down overall, but pressures tenuous on decreased dose, abdominal
   distention worsened
   - plan for chest/abdominal CT tomorrow morning when better staffing,
   concern for abscess
   - c. diff negative and all cultures negative to date
   - continues on vanc/meropenem/cipro
   - checking vancomycin level this morning, goal 15-20
   - cortisol 35
 Renal Failure
   - continuing on CVVH, acidoses improved
   - will continue to take fluid off with CVVH as tolerated
   - will d/w renal about possible contrast use
 Abdominal distention
   - will recheck bladder pressure today
   - likely will improve most with volume removal, no clear ascites on
   ultrasound but likely bowel edema, and ileus
 Atrial fibrillation
   - continues on amiodarone, will calculate total dose today
   - unable to convert to PO given poor bowel mobility
 Thrombocytopenia
   - resolved, on sc heparin
 Poor GI motility
   - not tolerating trophic tube feeds yesterday
   - abdominal CT tomorrow
 Anemia
   - stable, no clear

   Assessment and Plan
 ARDS
   - improved over past 24 hours, Fi02 down to 40%, likely due to volume
   removal and recruitment on higher PEEP
   - will continue to very slowly wean PEEP and follow gases
   - continues to have very high plateaus, which is concerning
   - if unable to come down on PEEP further due to oxygenation, will
   decreased TV to 350
 Shock
   - likely septic, though no clear pathogen identified, ongoing fever;
   all lines re-sited 10.16
   - levo down overall, but pressures tenuous on decreased dose, abdominal
   distention worsened
   - plan for chest/abdominal CT tomorrow morning when better staffing,
   concern for abscess
   - c. diff negative and all cultures negative to date
   - continues on vanc/meropenem/cipro
   - checking vancomycin level this morning, goal 15-20
   - cortisol 35
 Renal Failure
   - continuing on CVVH, acidoses improved
   - will continue to take fluid off with CVVH as tolerated
   - will d/w renal about possible contrast use for CT tomorrow
 Abdominal distention
   - will recheck bladder pressure today
   - likely will improve most with volume removal, no clear ascites on
   ultrasound but likely bowel edema, and ileus
 Atrial fibrillation
   - continues on amiodarone, will calculate total dose today
   - unable to convert to PO given poor bowel mobility
 Thrombocytopenia
   - resolved, on sc heparin
 Poor GI motility
   - not tolerating trophic tube feeds yesterday
   - abdominal CT tomorrow
Groin erythema
   - will start topical anti-fungal powder today
 Anemia
   - stable, no clear source of active bleeding

   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 158.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  S/P IR procedure
   Friday likely derecruited a lot of lung as patient was initially on
   higher FiO2 and higher PEEP. Patient slowly improving, with FiO2 40%
   but still with high PEEP.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - Maintain FiO2 to 40% and decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain paO2
   > 60
consider increasing FiO2 rather than increasing PEEP more.
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated and increase rate of fluid loss as
   tolerated.

   for broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP (unable to see on CXR in
   setting of ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and
   has had no more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a
   possibility, but RUQ u/s negative for achalculous cholecystitis.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis that progressed to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and mechanical ventilation due to ARDS.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's oxygenation parameters (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) indicate severe hypoxemia, and he requires supplemental oxygen through mechanical ventilation. The goal is to maintain adequate oxygenation while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Septic shock: The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. Despite changes in antibiotics, the source of infection has not been identified yet. Continued monitoring for signs of infection and source control are essential.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. CVVH is being used to support renal function, and the rate of fluid loss should be adjusted based on the patient's hemodynamic status.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring of heart rate and consideration for anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 178.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  S/P IR procedure
   Friday likely derecruited a lot of lung as patient was initially on
   higher FiO2 and higher PEEP. Patient slowly improving, with FiO2 50%
   but still with high PEEP.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - can increase PEEP to 26 for CT scan to prevent alveolar
   de-recruitment
   - Maintain FiO2 to 50% to 70% for CT scan, then wean and decrease PEEP
   as tolerated to maintain paO2 > 60
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue CVVHD with goal negative 2 L today
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  On vasopressin and levophed to maintain
   appropriate MAPs. Continues to spike low grade temps on CVVHD, now on
   meropenem, cipro, vanc. WBC improved. Unable to find source at this
   point. Lines changed [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn initially, but now changed to
   meropenem and cipro and vanc for broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP
   (unable to see on CXR in setting of ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is
   being treated for this and has had no more discharge from his nares.
   Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but RUQ u/s negative for acalculous
   cholecystitis.  Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff negative.
   Fungemia possibility, especially given risk factors of nutrition with
   lipids and now new rash.  Overall, unclear picture of source.  Other
   potential etiology of fever is ongoing pancreatitis.
   - CT chest, abdomen, sinuses today
   - pending CT results, will consider ID consult for ? fungal coverage
   versus trial off all antibiotics
   - continue vanc and meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]) for now.  (Vanc Trough
   20.1 in PM) Continue cipro (Day 1: [**2169-9-30**])
   - Vanc dosing per levels: should dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while
   on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - off levophed, on vasopressin.  Will consider turning off vasopressin
   if pressures ok after CT.
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  BUN/Cr/K/PO4 up off CVVH.  ATN highest on
   differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  D/c
d [**9-27**] overnight for line kinking and
   pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**] as new IR lines
   placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging filter. Re-started
   [**9-30**] without any significant problems. Also given albumin with CVVH
   [**9-30**].
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative 2 L.
   - Renal following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of 6.250 grams as of 0800 this AM.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs if any
   - Surgery has signed off.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals. Will
   re-try tube feeds after CT.  Can consider advancing OG to post-pyloric
   tube placement if still not tolerating trophic tube feeds by tomorrow
   ([**10-3**])
   - TPN for now
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Trophic tube feeds as above
   - Continue insulin gtt for glycemic control
   - Insulin in TPN.
   - will calculate 24 hour insulin needs if able to maintain stable tube
   feeds and transition to long-acting regimen
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct  29.9 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved. His platelets are up to 237 today.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody could not be sent as does not meet
   criteria for diagnosis, and subq heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside hospital admission)
   - Since plts are normalized,
   - Continue Heparin sub q.
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, which led to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 178, indicating severe hypoxemia. Ventilation per ARDS protocol is being followed to minimize tidal volume and plateau pressures. The goal is to maintain PaO2 above 60 and plateau pressures below 40.

2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient requires vasopressin and levophed to maintain appropriate mean arterial pressures (MAPs). There are ongoing efforts to identify the source of infection, with broad-spectrum antibiotics being administered. Possible sources include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, intra-abdominal infection, or fungemia.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated BUN, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate levels. CVVH is being continued as tolerated, with a goal negative fluid balance of 2 liters. Albumin is also being given with CVVH.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on amiodarone drips to maintain sinus rhythm. Diltiazem drip was stopped on"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 158.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  S/P IR procedure
   Friday likely derecruited a lot of lung as patient was initially on
   higher FiO2 and higher PEEP. Patient slowly improving, with FiO2 40%
   but still with high PEEP.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - Maintain FiO2 to 40% and decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain paO2
   > 60
consider increasing FiO2 rather than increasing PEEP more.
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated and increase rate of fluid loss as
   tolerated.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  On vasopressin and levophed to maintain
   appropriate MAPs. Continues to spike low grade temps on CVVH. WBC
   improved. Unable to find source at this point. Lines changed [**9-29**].
   Was on Zosyn initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro and vanc
   for broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP (unable to see on CXR in
   setting of ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and
   has had no more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a
   possibility, but RUQ u/s negative for achalculous cholecystitis.
   Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff possibility (previous was
   negative). Overall, unclear picture of source even though infection is
   likely given clinical picture.
   - if patient
s respiratory status improves consider CT of abdomen/chest
   and possibly sinuses.
   - continue vanc and meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]) for now.  (Vanc Trough
   20.1 in PM) Continue cipro (Day 1: [**2169-9-30**])
   - Vanc trough this AM before dosage: should dose all Abx with a CrCl of
   < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - Check C. diff today (negative x 1 so far)
   - Lactate normal
   - continue vasopressin.  levophed for MAPs < 65.  Wean down as
   tolerated
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed [**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - Consider ID consult if no source of infection can be found on CT.
   - Perform sputum blood culture and sputum culture today as this should
   be done q 3 days in the ICU if no source is found.
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  BUN/Cr/K/PO4 up off CVVH.  Likely ATN highest
   on differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  D/c
d [**9-27**] overnight for line kinking and
   pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**] as new IR lines
   placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging filter. Re-started
   yesterday without any significant problems. Also given albumin with
   CVVH yesterday which appeared to be equivical.
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. If patient
   becomes too hypotensive, change rate as net even rather than negative.
   - Renal following
   - Will discuss with renal the possibility of contrast in CT scan, if
   occurs tomorrow.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of XXX grams as of 0800 this AM.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs if any
   - Surgery has signed off.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals. Hold
   tube feeds for now in setting of decreased bowel sounds.
   - TPN for now
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Trophic tube feeds held due to high residuals. Hold for now.
   - Continue insulin gtt in setting of infection
   - Insulin in TPN.
   - will calculate 24 hour insulin needs if able to maintain stable tube
   feeds and transition to long-acting regimen
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct  29.9 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.  Guaiac + diarrhea + fluids
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved. His platelets are up to 237 today.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody could not be sent as does not meet
   criteria for diagnosis, and subq heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside hospital admission)
   - Since plts are normalized,

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, which led to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and has multiple complications, including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), hypotension, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and gallstone pancreatitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to further lung damage and respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection-related complications: The patient has ongoing sepsis, and the source of infection is still unclear. There is a risk of developing central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter-related urinary tract infection (CRUTI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function or the development of chronic kidney disease.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires vasopressor support. There is a risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac dysfunction due to the stress on the cardiovascular system.
5. Gastrointestinal"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 198.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  FiO2 50%, PEEP 22.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - can increase PEEP to 26 for CT scan to prevent alveolar
   de-recruitment
   - Maintain FiO2 to 50% to 70% for CT scan, then wean and decrease PEEP
   as tolerated to maintain paO2 > 60
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue CVVHD with goal negative 2-3 L today
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Off vasopressin and levophed, BPs ok.
   Continues to spike low grade temps on CVVHD, now on meropenem, cipro,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU with worsening gallstone pancreatitis, leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 198, indicating severe hypoxemia. ARDS is likely, and the patient requires careful management to maintain adequate oxygenation while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury. The goal is to keep plateau pressures below 40 cmH2O and ensure a PaO2 above 60 mmHg.

2. Septic Shock: The patient remains at risk for septic shock, despite being off vasopressors at the moment. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, including meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's temperature, white blood cell count, and blood cultures to identify the source of infection.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis and hypoperfusion. CVVH has been started and needs to be continued to manage fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as acid-base disturbances. Daily assessments of renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 198.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  FiO2 50%, PEEP 22.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - wean FiO2 and decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain paO2 > 60
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - start fentanyl patch 150 mcg today with goal to reduce fentanyl drip
   - consider starting PO valium tomorrow if tolerating trophic tube feeds
   with goal to decrease midazolam
   - goal of sedation is approximately 2 overbreaths/minute on vent
   - Continue CVVHD with goal negative 2-3 L today
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Off vasopressin and levophed, BPs ok.
   Continues to spike low grade temps on CVVHD, now on meropenem, cipro,
   vanc. WBC stable. Unable to find source at this point. Lines changed
   [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro
   and vanc for broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP (unable to see on
   CXR in setting of ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for
   this and has had no more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a
   possibility, but RUQ u/s negative for acalculous cholecystitis.
   Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff negative. Fungemia
   possibility, especially given risk factors of nutrition with lipids and
   now new rash.  Overall, unclear picture of source.  Other potential
   etiology of fever is ongoing pancreatitis.
   - will defer CT chest, abdomen, sinuses today given tenuous
   respiratory/hemodynamics
   - ID consult for ? fungal coverage
   - continue vanc and meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]) for now.  (Vanc Trough
   20.1 in PM) Continue cipro (Day 1: [**2169-9-30**])
   - Vanc dosing per levels: should dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while
   on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - off levophed and vasopressin.  Can re-start pressors PRN
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.  Negative 4L
   [**10-2**], [**Name2 (NI) **]ed well.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative 2-3 L.
   - Renal following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of 6.970 grams as of 0800 this AM.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos increasing.
   - RUQ U/S to evaluate for dilated biliary ducts
   - discuss with ERCP if have concern for elevated alk phos
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals.
   Re-started trophic tube feeds overnight, tolerated well.  Can consider
   advancing OG to post-pyloric tube placement if still not tolerating
   trophic tube feeds today
   - TPN for now.  Will discuss with nutrition to consider changing to
   low-lipid tube feeds
   - check residuals Q 4hrs
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN.
   - Trophic tube feeds as above
   - Continue insulin gtt for glycemic control
   - increase Insulin in TPN to 100 units.
   - will moinitor insulin gtt needs and can titrate up insulin in TPN
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.  Low suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody
   could not be sent as does not meet criteria for diagnosis, and subq
   heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at
   outside hospital admission)
   - Continue Heparin sub q.
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, respiratory failure (ARDS), and oliguric renal failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient has been stable, but there are concerns about a possible fungal infection due to his immunocompromised state and the lack of clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has been managed according to ARDS protocol with ventilation settings aimed at maintaining a PaO2 > 60 and plateau pressures < 40. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP will be done as tolerated.
2. Hypotension/Sep tic Shock: The patient was previously on vasopressor support, but is now off, with BPs being maintained. The source of infection is still unclear, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVH has been initiated and will continue with a goal negative 2-3 L/day. Renal function will be closely monitored.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on amiodarone drips and is currently in sinus rhythm. The goal is to maintain a heart rate < 120 bpm to"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 178.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  S/P IR procedure
   Friday likely derecruited a lot of lung as patient was initially on
   higher FiO2 and higher PEEP. Patient slowly improving, with FiO2 50%
   but still with high PEEP.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - can increase PEEP to 26 for CT scan to prevent alveolar
   de-recruitment
   - Maintain FiO2 to 50% to 70% for CT scan, then wean and decrease PEEP
   as tolerated to maintain paO2 > 60
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation
   - Continue CVVHD with goal negative 2 L today
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  On vasopressin and levophed to maintain
   appropriate MAPs. Continues to spike low grade temps on CVVHD, now on
   meropenem, cipro, vanc. WBC improved. Unable to find source at this
   point. Lines changed [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn initially, but now changed to
   meropenem and cipro and vanc for broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP
   (unable to see on CXR in setting of ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is
   being treated for this and has had no more discharge from his nares.
   Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but RUQ u/s negative for acalculous
   cholecystitis.  Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff negative.
   Fungemia possibility, especially given risk factors of nutrition with
   lipids and now new rash.  Overall, unclear picture of source.  Other
   potential etiology of fever is ongoing pancreatitis.
   - CT chest, abdomen, sinuses today
   - pending CT results, will consider ID consult for ? fungal coverage
   versus trial off all antibiotics
   - continue vanc and meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]) for now.  (Vanc Trough
   20.1 in PM) Continue cipro (Day 1: [**2169-9-30**])
   - Vanc dosing per levels: should dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while
   on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - off levophed, on vasopressin.  Will consider turning off vasopressin
   if pressures ok after CT.
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  BUN/Cr/K/PO4 up off CVVH.  ATN highest on
   differential at this point. Started CVVH Monday afternoon [**9-25**];
   patient tolerating well.  D/c
d [**9-27**] overnight for line kinking and
   pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**] as new IR lines
   placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging filter. Re-started
   [**9-30**] without any significant problems. Also given albumin with CVVH
   [**9-30**].
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative 2 L.
   - Renal following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of 6.250 grams as of 0800 this AM.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down
   - f/u ERCP/GI recs if any
   - Surgery has signed off.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals. Will
   re-try tube feeds after CT.  Can consider advancing OG to post-pyloric
   tube placement if still not tolerating trophic tube feeds by tomorrow
   ([**10-3**])
   - TPN for now
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt.
   - Trophic tube feeds as above
   - Continue insulin gtt for glycemic control
   - Insulin in TPN.
   - will calculate 24 hour insulin needs if able to maintain stable tube
   feeds and transition to long-acting regimen
   .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct  29.9 (from 52 at OSH when
   hemoconcentrated) but stable currently.
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved. His platelets are up to 237 today.  Low
   suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody could not be sent as does not meet
   criteria for diagnosis, and subq heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at outside hospital admission)
   - Since plts are normalized,
   - Continue Heparin sub q.
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient has been improving slowly, with FiO2 at 50% and high PEEP requirement. He continues to be managed per ARDS protocol with a goal PaO2 > 60 and plateau pressures < 40. The patient is also on vasopressin and levophed to maintain appropriate mean arterial pressures (MAPs). He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin, due to suspected or confirmed infection sources such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, intra-abdominal infection, and fungemia. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and sinuses is planned to further evaluate potential infection sources. The patient's renal function is improving, and CVVH is being continued as tolerated. He has a history of hyperglycemia, likely due to underlying type II diabetes, and is being managed with an insulin gtt. The patient also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which have resolved with transfusions and medical management. His current medications include amiodarone, midazolam, fentanyl, calcium gluconate"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS. The ventilator settings need to be closely monitored to maintain adequate oxygenation and minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. There is a need to balance the tidal volume and PEEP to keep plateau pressures low.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has septic shock, and there is a concern about finding the source of infection. The patient's fever curve and white blood cell count should be trended. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but if no source is found, further evaluation for fungal coverage or trial off all antibiotics may be necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric acute renal failure, and CVVH has been initiated. The patient tolerates the CVVH well, but there have been some issues with line kinking and clogging filters. The rate of CVVH should be advanced as tolerated, aiming for a negative fluid balance.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis that progressed to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 198, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is being managed per ARDS protocol with low tidal volume ventilation and low plateau pressures to minimize lung injury. The goal is to maintain a PaO2 > 60 while weaning FiO2 and decreasing PEEP as tolerated.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension due to septic shock. Pressors such as vasopressin and norepinephrine have been used to maintain blood pressure, but they have been discontinued for now. The source of infection remains unclear, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. There is concern for fungal infection, and an ID consult has been requested for potential fungal coverage.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVH has been initiated and restarted multiple times due to line issues and filter clogging. The goal is to continue CVVHD as tolerated, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 2-3 liters.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 198.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  FiO2 40%, PEEP 22.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - wean FiO2 and decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain paO2 > 60
   - will likely require higher PEEP, FiO2 for scan
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation.  d/c fentanyl patch.  Start
   IV methadone TID after scan.
   - consider starting PO valium tomorrow if tolerating trophic tube feeds
   with goal to decrease midazolam
   - Sedation goal [**12-16**] overbreaths per minute
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 24 hours.  Now on meropenem,
   cipro, vanc. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed fungemia.  WBC stable.
   Unable to find source at this point. Lines changed [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn
   initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro and vanc for broader
   coverage.  Other sources: VAP (unable to see on CXR in setting of
   ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and has had no
   more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but
   RUQ u/s negative for acalculous cholecystitis.  Enzymes are all also
   trending down. C. diff negative. Fungemia possibility, especially given
   risk factors of nutrition with lipids and now new rash.  Overall,
   unclear picture of source.  Other potential etiology of fever is
   ongoing pancreatitis.
   - will attempt CT head, chest, abdomen, pelvis today
   - continue micofungin (day 1: [**2169-10-3**])
   - continue vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and cipro (Day 1:
   [**2169-9-30**]) for now.  Will re-visit ongoing need for antibiotics versus
   continuing lone anti-fungal coverage given all negative cultures after
   CT.
   - change to q24 hour vanc dosing today: should dose all Abx with a CrCl
   of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - pressors PRN
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative 2-3 L.
   - Renal following
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos increasing.
   - RUQ U/S to evaluate for dilated biliary ducts
   - discuss with ERCP if have concern for elevated alk phos
   - check GGT to r/o alternative source of alk phos.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals.
   Re-started trophic tube feeds overnight, tolerated well.  Can consider
   advancing OG to post-pyloric tube placement if still not tolerating
   trophic tube feeds today
   - changed to no lipid TPN
   - check residuals Q 4hrs
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN.
   - Trophic tube feeds as above
   - Insulin in TPN to 100 units + RISS.
   - d/c insulin gtt
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of 6.970 grams as of 0800 this AM.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.  Low suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody
   could not be sent as does not meet criteria for diagnosis, and subq
   heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at
   outside hospital admission)
   - Continue Heparin sub q.
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 198, indicating severe hypoxemia. The goal is to maintain a PaO2 > 60 and plateau pressures < 40. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Septic Shock: Despite being afebrile for 24 hours, the patient remains on multiple antibiotics and antifungal medication due to presumed fungemia. The source of infection is still unclear, and there is a risk of ongoing sepsis or development of multi-drug resistant organisms.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as indicated by the need for CVVH. There is a risk of persistent renal dysfunction or need for further renal replacement therapy.

4. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient had a CBD stent placed by ERCP, and his lipase and amylase levels are improving. However,"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 198.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  FiO2 40%, PEEP 22.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - wean FiO2 and decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain paO2 > 60
   - will likely require higher PEEP, FiO2 for scan
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation.  d/c fentanyl patch.  Start
   IV methadone TID after scan.
   - consider starting PO valium tomorrow if tolerating trophic tube feeds
   with goal to decrease midazolam
   - Sedation goal [**12-16**] overbreaths per minute
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 24 hours.  Now on meropenem,
   cipro, vanc. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed fungemia.  WBC stable.
   Unable to find source at this point. Lines changed [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn
   initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro and vanc for broader
   coverage.  Other sources: VAP (unable to see on CXR in setting of
   ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and has had no
   more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but
   RUQ u/s negative for acalculous cholecystitis.  Enzymes are all also
   trending down. C. diff negative. Fungemia possibility, especially given
   risk factors of nutrition with lipids and now new rash.  Overall,
   unclear picture of source.  Other potential etiology of fever is
   ongoing pancreatitis.
   - will attempt CT head, chest, abdomen, pelvis today
   - continue micofungin (day 1: [**2169-10-3**])
   - continue vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and cipro (Day 1:
   [**2169-9-30**]) for now.  Will re-visit ongoing need for antibiotics versus
   continuing lone anti-fungal coverage given all negative cultures after
   CT.
   - change to q24 hour vanc dosing today: should dose all Abx with a CrCl
   of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - pressors PRN
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative 2-3 L.
   - Renal following
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos increasing.
   - RUQ U/S to evaluate for dilated biliary ducts
   - discuss with ERCP if have concern for elevated alk phos
   - check GGT to r/o alternative source of alk phos.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals.
   Re-started trophic tube feeds overnight, tolerated well.  Can consider
   advancing OG to post-pyloric tube placement if still not tolerating
   trophic tube feeds today
   - changed to no lipid TPN
   - check residuals Q 4hrs
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN.
   - Trophic tube feeds as above
   - Insulin in TPN to 100 units + RISS.
   - d/c insulin gtt
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of 6.970 grams as of 0800 this AM.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.  Low suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody
   could not be sent as does not meet criteria for diagnosis, and subq
   heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at
   outside hospital admission)
   - Continue Heparin sub q.
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

   intra-abdominal pathology given persistence of fever particularly while
   the patient is on CVVH.  Respiratory: will keep vent settings where
   they are for now given that the patient will be traveling for CT scan,
   may have a set back with transport, will re-evaluate post CT scan.
   Derm c/s for rash as per ID, but is improving without other

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis that led to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension/septic shock, acute renal failure, gallstone pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
- Heart rate: 82 bpm
- Blood pressure: 107/44 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 34 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral icterus and edema, pupils small and equal, neck supple but with jugular venous distention difficult to assess, clear lung sounds bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with normal S1/S2, distended abdomen with dullness to percussion at the flanks and inferiorly, warm and well-perfused extremities with edema, and areas of breakdown over the right upper thorax anteriorly and penis.

   renal failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - phone meeting yesterday at 3 pm:
   - ID consulted: emprically start micofungin, low suscipcion for this,
   but treat for now. Would like to scan him as well to get a better idea.
   Would also like derm to biopsy the rash.
   - hold off on imaging until trial of anti-fungal treatment
   - attempt to wean off sedation drips, 150 mcg fentanyl patch started
   yesterday to come down on fentanyl drip, will try 10 mg valium q 8
   hours as tolerated once tube feeds are tolerated well to come down on
   midazolam
   - CVVHD approx - 2 liters around 0000.
   - became hypotensive with MAPS in the 40s, 50s. Vasopressin started,
   changed to even on CVVH, then slightly fluid positive.  Still with MAPS
   in the 40's. Started levophed.
   - increasing alk phos.  RUQ U/S, touch base with GI
   - PPI and insulin added to TPN in order to reduce number of lines/drips
   necessary.
   - had to increase sedation b/c breath stacking with rates 35-37 breaths
   per minute after CXR. PIPs up to the 50s. calmed down some, but still

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and is being managed per ARDS protocol. The main goals are to maintain adequate oxygenation and minimize ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite being off vasopressin and levophed. There is ongoing fever, and the source of infection is still unclear. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and a fungal infection is also suspected. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is receiving CVVH. The goal is to maintain negative fluid balance and advance the rate of CVVH as tolerated.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in sinus rhythm but previously had atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone is being continued for now until the patient can tolerate oral medication.
5. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, and a CBD stent was placed."

   Chief Complaint: pancreatitis, septic shock, respiratory failure, acute
   renal failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - phone meeting yesterday at 3 pm:
   - ID consulted: emprically start micofungin,  Would like to scan him as
   well to get a better idea. Would also like derm to biopsy the rash.
   - hold off on imaging until trial of anti-fungal treatment
   - attempt to wean off sedation drips, 150 mcg fentanyl patch started
   yesterday to come down on fentanyl drip, will try 10 mg valium q 8
   hours as tolerated once tube feeds are tolerated well to come down on
   midazolam
   - CVVHD approx - 2 liters around 0000.
   - became hypotensive with MAPS in the 40s, 50s. Vasopressin started,
   changed to even on CVVH, then slightly fluid positive.  Still with MAPS
   in the 40's. Started levophed.
   - increasing alk phos.  RUQ U/S, touch base with GI
   - PPI and insulin added to TPN in order to reduce number of lines/drips
   necessary.
   - had to increase sedation b/c breath stacking with rates 35-37 breaths
   per minute after CXR. PIPs up to the 50s. calmed down some, but still

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, he is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 198. The goal is to maintain a plateau pressure below 40 cmH2O and a PaO2 above 60. FiO2 and PEEP will be weaned as tolerated.

Secondly, the patient is hypotensive/septic shock. He is afebrile for 24 hours and is currently on meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. Micafungin has been added for presumed fungemia. The source of infection has not yet been identified, and other potential etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, intra-abdominal infection, or ongoing pancreatitis. Further investigations, such as a CT scan, are planned to identify the source of infection.

Thirdly, the patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVH has been started and will be continued as tolerated, with"

   Chief Complaint: pancreatitis, septic shock, respiratory failure, acute
   renal failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - phone meeting yesterday at 3 pm:
   - ID consulted: emprically start micofungin,  Would like to scan him as
   well to get a better idea. Would also like derm to biopsy the rash.
   - hold off on imaging until trial of anti-fungal treatment
   - attempt to wean off sedation drips, 150 mcg fentanyl patch started
   yesterday to come down on fentanyl drip, will try 10 mg valium q 8
   hours as tolerated once tube feeds are tolerated well to come down on
   midazolam
   - CVVHD approx - 2 liters around 0000.
   - became hypotensive with MAPS in the 40s, 50s. Vasopressin started,
   changed to even on CVVH, then slightly fluid positive.  Still with MAPS
   in the 40's. Started levophed.
   - increasing alk phos.  RUQ U/S, touch base with GI
   - PPI and insulin added to TPN in order to reduce number of lines/drips
   necessary.
   - had to increase sedation b/c breath stacking with rates 35-37 breaths
   per minute after CXR. PIPs up to the 50s. calmed down some, but still
   overbreathing

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 198.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  FiO2 40%, PEEP 22.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - wean FiO2 and decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain paO2 > 60
   - will likely require higher PEEP, FiO2 for scan
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation.  d/c fentanyl patch.  Start
   IV methadone TID after scan.
   - consider starting PO valium tomorrow if tolerating trophic tube feeds
   with goal to decrease midazolam
   - Sedation goal [**12-16**] overbreaths per minute
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 24 hours.  Now on meropenem,
   cipro, vanc. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed fungemia.  WBC stable.
   Unable to find source at this point. Lines changed [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn
   initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro and vanc for broader
   coverage.  Other sources: VAP (unable to see on CXR in setting of
   ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and has had no
   more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but
   RUQ u/s negative for acalculous cholecystitis.  Enzymes are all also
   trending down. C. diff negative. Fungemia possibility, especially given
   risk factors of nutrition with lipids and now new rash.  Overall,
   unclear picture of source.  Other potential etiology of fever is
   ongoing pancreatitis.
   - will attempt CT head, chest, abdomen, pelvis today
   - continue micofungin (day 1: [**2169-10-3**])
   - continue vanc and meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]) for now.  (Vanc Trough
   20.1 in PM) Continue cipro (Day 1: [**2169-9-30**])
   - change to q24 hour vanc dosing today: should dose all Abx with a CrCl
   of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - trend fever curve and WBC

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot

   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of 6.970 grams as of 0800 this AM.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos increasing.
   - RUQ U/S to evaluate for dilated biliary ducts
   - discuss with ERCP if have concern for elevated alk phos
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals.
   Re-started trophic tube feeds overnight, tolerated well.  Can consider
   advancing OG to post-pyloric tube placement if still not tolerating
   trophic tube feeds today
   - TPN for now.  Will discuss with nutrition to consider changing to
   low-lipid tube feeds
   - check residuals Q 4hrs
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN.
   - Trophic tube feeds as above
   - Continue insulin gtt for glycemic control
   - increase Insulin in TPN to 100 units.
   - will moinitor insulin gtt needs and can titrate up insulin in TPN

   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis. He developed septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension/Septic Shock, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, gallstone pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a CBD stent, CVVH, and changes in antibiotics. He is receiving TPN and has been started on trophic tube feeds. His blood glucose levels are being controlled with an insulin gtt and insulin in TPN. His HCT is stable, and he has resolved thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's ARDS is being managed according to ARDSnet guidelines, with goals of maintaining a plateau pressure < 40 and PaO2 > 60. FiO2 and PEEP will be adjusted as tolerated.
2. Hypotension/Septric Shock: Despite being afebrile for 24 hours, the source of sepsis remains unclear. The patient is on broad"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient's condition is still unstable with ongoing hypotension and fever. Despite being afebrile for 24 hours, the source of infection remains unclear, and he has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications. Other potential causes of fever are being investigated.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 198 and requires mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume and appropriate PEEP levels to maintain plateau pressures below 40. FiO2 and PEEP will be weaned as tolerated.
2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: Despite being afebrile for 24 hours, the patient remains hypotensive and requires vasopressors. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin, have been started, along with antifungal coverage due to suspicion of fungemia. The source of infection is still unclear.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is receiving CVVH. The filter has been changed, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 270.  Was ventilated per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  FiO2 40%, PEEP 20.
   Lung fields largely clear on CT and CXR, so may not need ARDS protocol
   ventilation
   - Decrease PEEP to 18.  If tolerates, will switch to pressure support
   18/18 if not too sedated to determine comfortable TV.
   - Continue to wean Midazolam and fentanyl, methadone for sedation.
   Wean midazolam and fentanyl as tolerated.  Will consider switch from
   midazolam to propofol as tolerated by BP in order to allow clearance of
   midazolam.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 48 hours.  WBC stable. Now on
   meropenem, cipro, vanc. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed fungemia.
   Had been febrile and requiring pressors, but unable to find source
   negative, CXR clear, cultures all negative. Lines changed [**9-29**].  Was
   on Zosyn initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro and vanc for
   broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP (lungs clear on CXR/CT);
   Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and has had no more
   discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but CT
   negative.  Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff negative.
   Fungemia possibility, especially given risk factors of nutrition with
   lipids and now new rash.  Overall, unclear picture of source.  Other
   potential etiology of fever is ongoing pancreatitis.  Off pressors.
   - continue vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and micafungin (day 1:
   [**2169-10-3**]).  D/C cipro

   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN, now on 105 insulin in TPN + RISS.  BS in 200s yesterday
   - Increase Insulin in TPN to 120 units + RISS.
   # FEN/GI:  No BM x 48 hours.  On TPN.  Has failed trophic tube feeds in
   past, has been off x 24 hours now.
   - re-trial of trophic tube feeds at 10 cc/hr
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - continue TPN without lipids
   - increase bowel regimen.  Start with PR suppository, lactulose enema
   PRN.  Start anti-narcotic ileus per OG tube.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has multiple complications including hypoxic respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension/Septic shock, gallstone pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, fecal/urinary incontinence, atrial fibrillation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates severe hypoxemia, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension/Septic shock: Despite being afebrile for 48 hours, the patient's WBC count is stable, and he is still on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a possibility of ongoing sepsis or a new infection, which can result in recurrent hypotension and shock.
3. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen or lead to complications such as pancreatic pseudocyst or abscess formation.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars are still in the 200s, indicating poor glycemic control. This can increase the risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 270.  Was ventilated per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  FiO2 40%, PEEP 20.
   Lung fields largely clear on CT and CXR, so may not need ARDS protocol
   ventilation
   - Decrease PEEP to 18.  If tolerates, will switch to pressure support
   18/18 if not too sedated to determine comfortable TV.
   - Continue to wean Midazolam and fentanyl, methadone for sedation.
   Wean midazolam and fentanyl as tolerated.  Will consider switch from
   midazolam to propofol as tolerated by BP in order to allow clearance of
   midazolam.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 48 hours.  WBC stable. Now on
   meropenem, cipro, vanc. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed fungemia.
   Unable to find source at this point. Lines changed [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn
   initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro and vanc for broader
   coverage.  Other sources: VAP (lungs clear on CXR/CT); Sinusitis: but
   patient is being treated for this and has had no more discharge from
   his nares. Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but RUQ u/s negative for
   acalculous cholecystitis.  Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff
   negative. Fungemia possibility, especially given risk factors of
   nutrition with lipids and now new rash.  Overall, unclear picture of
   source.  Other potential etiology of fever is ongoing pancreatitis.
   - will attempt CT head, chest, abdomen, pelvis today
   - continue micofungin (day 1: [**2169-10-3**])
   - continue vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and cipro (Day 1:
   [**2169-9-30**]) for now.  Will re-visit ongoing need for antibiotics versus
   continuing lone anti-fungal coverage given all negative cultures after
   CT.
   - change to q24 hour vanc dosing today: should dose all Abx with a CrCl
   of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - pressors PRN
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative 2-3 L.
   - Renal following
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos increasing.
   - RUQ U/S to evaluate for dilated biliary ducts
   - discuss with ERCP if have concern for elevated alk phos
   - check GGT to r/o alternative source of alk phos.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals.
   Re-started trophic tube feeds overnight, tolerated well.  Can consider
   advancing OG to post-pyloric tube placement if still not tolerating
   trophic tube feeds today
   - changed to no lipid TPN
   - check residuals Q 4hrs
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN.
   - Trophic tube feeds as above
   - Insulin in TPN to 100 units + RISS.
   - d/c insulin gtt
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of 6.970 grams as of 0800 this AM.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.  Low suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody
   could not be sent as does not meet criteria for diagnosis, and subq
   heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at
   outside hospital admission)
   - Continue Heparin sub q.
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

   [**Name (NI) 156**] status: DNR (ok to intubate)
   Disposition:  ICU
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma who was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates the need for continued monitoring and management of ARDS. The plan includes weaning off mechanical ventilation and providing supplemental oxygen as needed.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for presumed sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The source of infection remains unclear, and further investigation is needed to identify the causative organism. Fungemia is also a possibility, and antifungal coverage has been initiated.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis and hypotension. CVVH has been started, and the goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance. Renal function should continue to be monitored closely.

4. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient underwent an ERCP procedure with CBD stent placement. His lipase and amylase levels are improving, indicating a response to the intervention. Further evaluation of biliary ducts and consideration of alternative sources for elevated alkaline phosphatase should be done.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels suggest undiagnosed diabetes, which needs to be managed with insulin therapy. Trophic tube feeds have been started, and close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of atrial fibrillation. Maintenance dosing of amiodarone should be considered once the loading dose is completed.

7. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's hematocrit and platelet counts are stable, indicating that these conditions have resolved. However, ongoing monitoring and appropriate interventions should be considered if there are any changes.

8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures such as heparin and pneumatic boots should be continued to prevent DVT.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems, including respiratory, renal, endocrine, and cardiovascular functions."

    Agree with excellent med student note with the addition of the
   following problem to the Assessment and Plan:
   # Rash:
   Erythematous rash on Left flank improving, but newer rash on R medial
   arm and left dorsal arm.  Initial concern was for fungal infection, but
   dermatology was consulted.  Rash thought to be secondary to stasis
   dermatitis in setting of anasarca, but consider that it could also be
   secondary to drug rash.  Dermatology did not biopsy rash at this time.
   - continue to monitor rash for growth or changes, other locations ;
   continue to monitor oropharynx for possible eruption that could signify
   drug rash

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His lungs are clear, but he is still on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 370 mL, respiratory system compliance of 46.3 mL/cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cmH2O. The patient's glucose levels have been in the 200s, and he has been on an insulin drip to control his blood sugar.

The patient has a history of anemia but is currently stable with a hematocrit level of 25.2%. He also has thrombocytopenia, which has resolved, and his platelet count is now normal. He is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, so he is receiving prophylactic heparin and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), respectively.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low sodium, chloride,"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 270. He is being ventilated according to ARDS protocol with a tidal volume (TV) of 370 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cmH2O. His lung fields are largely clear on CT and chest X-ray, so he may not need ARDS protocol ventilation. The plan is to decrease PEEP to 18 cmH2O and switch to pressure support if tolerated.

The patient also has hypotension/Septic Shock, which has improved, and he is now off pressors. He has had no fever for 48 hours, and his WBC count is stable. He is being treated with meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin, and micafungin has been added for presumed fungemia. Other potential sources of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, and intra-abdominal infection, are being addressed.

The patient's gallstone pancreatitis is improving, with CBD stenting placed by ERCP fellow."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 198.  Ventilation per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40.  Has tolerated weaning to TV 370.  FiO2 40%, PEEP 22.
   - Continue to manage per ARDS net, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures <
   40 for now given increased abdominal pressure and PEEP requirement.
   - wean FiO2 and decrease PEEP as tolerated to maintain paO2 > 60
   - will likely require higher PEEP, FiO2 for scan
   - Midazolam and fentanyl prn for sedation.  d/c fentanyl patch.  Start
   IV methadone TID after scan.
   - consider starting PO valium tomorrow if tolerating trophic tube feeds
   with goal to decrease midazolam
   - Sedation goal [**12-16**] overbreaths per minute
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 24 hours.  Now on meropenem,
   cipro, vanc. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed fungemia.  WBC stable.
   Unable to find source at this point. Lines changed [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn
   initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro and vanc for broader
   coverage.  Other sources: VAP (unable to see on CXR in setting of
   ARDS); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and has had no
   more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but
   RUQ u/s negative for acalculous cholecystitis.  Enzymes are all also
   trending down. C. diff negative. Fungemia possibility, especially given
   risk factors of nutrition with lipids and now new rash.  Overall,
   unclear picture of source.  Other potential etiology of fever is
   ongoing pancreatitis.
   - will attempt CT head, chest, abdomen, pelvis today
   - continue micofungin (day 1: [**2169-10-3**])
   - continue vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and cipro (Day 1:
   [**2169-9-30**]) for now.  Will re-visit ongoing need for antibiotics versus
   continuing lone anti-fungal coverage given all negative cultures after
   CT.
   - change to q24 hour vanc dosing today: should dose all Abx with a CrCl
   of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u culture data.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - If still unable to find source, consider LENI
s to rule out DVT.
   - pressors PRN
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative 2-3 L.
   - Renal following
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos increasing.
   - RUQ U/S to evaluate for dilated biliary ducts
   - discuss with ERCP if have concern for elevated alk phos
   - check GGT to r/o alternative source of alk phos.
   - trophic feeds started [**9-28**], patient with significant residuals.
   Re-started trophic tube feeds overnight, tolerated well.  Can consider
   advancing OG to post-pyloric tube placement if still not tolerating
   trophic tube feeds today
   - changed to no lipid TPN
   - check residuals Q 4hrs
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN.
   - Trophic tube feeds as above
   - Insulin in TPN to 100 units + RISS.
   - d/c insulin gtt
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose as patient cannot
   take po
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, may need to
   give maintenance dose through IV (200 mg/day) -  -
   - Currently received a total of 6.970 grams as of 0800 this AM.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.  Low suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody
   could not be sent as does not meet criteria for diagnosis, and subq
   heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has a low oxygenation index (p/f ratio 198) and is being managed according to ARDS protocol. The goal is to maintain a PaO2 > 60, plateau pressures < 40, and wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.
2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: Despite being afebrile for 24 hours, the patient remains hypotensive and requires pressors. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and a fungal infection is suspected, so antifungal coverage has been added. The source of infection is still unclear.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is receiving CVVH. The goal is to advance the rate of CVVH and aim for negative fluid balance of -2 to -3 L.
4. Gallstone Pancreatitis: A cholecystectomy (CBD stent) has been performed. Lipase and amylase levels are improving, and liver function tests ("

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 325.  Was ventilated per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40, but lung fields largely clear on CT and CXR, so does
   not need ARDS protocol ventilation.  PS trial this am with TV
   650-700ml, minute vent 7-8.  Tolerated PEEP of 16, FiO2 of 40%, TV 450
   with RR 26.
   - PS trial today.  Check ABG.  If doing well, can leave on PS.  If
   needs assist control, will set higher TV to 500-550 and rate 20 to
   stimulate spontaneous breathing.
   - Continue to wean sedation.  Goal off fentanyl today, continue with
   methadone TID for sedation.
   - Haldol or propofol PRN for sedation in order to allow clearance of
   midazolam.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 48 hours.  WBC stable. Now on
   meropenem, vanc, micofungin. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed
   fungemia.  Had been febrile and requiring pressors, but unable to find
   source
CT negative, CXR clear, cultures all negative. Lines changed
   [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro
   and vanc for broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP (lungs clear on
   CXR/CT); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and has had
   no more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but
   CT negative.  Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff negative.
   Fungemia possibility, given risk factors of nutrition with lipids and
   new rash, but B-glucan negative.  Overall, unclear picture of source.
   Other potential etiology of fever is ongoing pancreatitis.  Off
   pressors.
   - continue vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and micafungin (day 1:
   [**2169-10-3**]).  (Cipro d/c
d [**10-5**])
   - plan to move towards removing abx if no increase in WBC, fever, signs
   of infection.  Per ID, consider d/c micofungin [**10-7**], monitor for 24
   hrs, d/c meropenem [**10-8**], monitor x 24 hours, d/c vancomycin [**10-9**].
   - dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u remaining culture data.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN, now on 120 insulin in TPN + RISS.  BS in 250s yesterday
   - Increase Insulin in TPN to 140 units.
   - restart insulin drip today, plan to calculate needs in the context of
   decreasing TPN and increasing tube feeds
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - follow with serial exams and outlining
   - no therapy for now
   # FEN/GI:  BM this AM.  On TPN.  Has failed trophic tube feeds in past,
   restarted at 10 cc/hr [**10-5**], no residuals this AM with active bowel
   sounds
   - advance tube feeds per nutrition recs while decreasing TPN.  Goal is
   to be on tube feeds and off TPN over the weekend.
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - continue TPN without lipids, wean as increasing tube feeds.
   - continue bowel regimen with PR dulcolax, POG colace, senna,
   erythromycin.
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.  Was
   negative 6.5 L [**10-5**], tolerated well, now near even for LOS.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative 1-2 L.
   - Renal following
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos stable, elevated
   likely due to cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Dilt drip
   stopped [**9-25**]
   - Continue amio gtt for now for entire loading dose
   - Goal to keep patient
s HR < 120 as to improve CO and perfusion
   - Keep track of Amio dosage; once 10 grams is achieved, can d/c to
   evaluate if ongoing needs
   - Currently received a total of 8.41 grams as of 0800 this AM.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   - Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.  Low suspicion for HIT, and HIT antibody
   could not be sent as does not meet criteria for diagnosis, and subq
   heparin DCed [**2169-9-28**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to Zosyn. (platelets 202 at
   outside hospital admission)
   - Continue Heparin sub q.
   - Continue to trend.
   - No signs of active bleeding

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and lung fields are clear on CT and chest X-ray. The patient is now off ARDS ventilation and is tolerating pressure support well. The plan is to continue weaning the patient off sedation and allow spontaneous breathing.

The patient's blood sugar levels are being controlled with insulin in the total parenteral nutrition (TPN), as he likely had underlying type II diabetes. His renal function is being monitored closely, and CVVH is being continued as tolerated, with the goal of achieving negative fluid balance.

The patient's skin condition is being monitored due to bullous lesions on the thigh and a rash on the flank and extremities. These lesions are likely stasis dermatitis and less likely drug rashes. No therapy is planned at this time.

The patient's gastrointestinal function is being assessed, and he is being advanced to tube feeds while decreasing TPN. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with amiodarone, and the goal is to maintain his heart rate below 120 beats per minute to improve cardiac output and perfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient has multiple complications including hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS, hypotension/septic shock, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicating severe hypoxemia. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Hypotension/Sep tic Shock: Despite being afebrile for 48 hours, the patient's WBC count is stable, and he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is still a risk of recurrent septic shock. Monitoring for signs of hypotension and organ dysfunction is crucial.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he has a history of type II diabetes. It is essential to maintain tight glycemic control to prevent complications such as infections and poor wound healing.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is dependent on CVVH. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 325.  Was ventilated per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40, but lung fields largely clear on CT and CXR, so does
   not need ARDS protocol ventilation.  PS trial this am with TV
   650-700ml, minute vent 7-8.  Tolerated PEEP of 16, FiO2 of 40%, TV 450
   with RR 26.
   - PS trial today.  Check ABG.  If doing well, can leave on PS.  If
   needs assist control, will set higher TV to 500-550 and rate 20 to
   stimulate spontaneous breathing.
   - Continue to wean sedation.  Goal off fentanyl today, continue with
   methadone TID for sedation.
   - Haldol or propofol PRN for sedation in order to allow clearance of
   midazolam.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 48 hours.  WBC stable. Now on
   meropenem, vanc, micofungin. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed

   CXR/CT); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and has had
   no more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but
   CT negative.  Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff negative.
   Fungemia possibility, given risk factors of nutrition with lipids and
   new rash, but B-glucan negative.  Overall, unclear picture of source.
   Other potential etiology of fever is ongoing pancreatitis.  Off
   pressors.
   - continue vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and micafungin (day 1:
   [**2169-10-3**]).  (Cipro d/c
d [**10-5**])
   - plan to move towards removing abx if no increase in WBC, fever, signs
   of infection.  Per ID, consider d/c micofungin [**10-7**], monitor for 24
   hrs, d/c meropenem [**10-8**], monitor x 24 hours, d/c vancomycin [**10-9**].
   - dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal

   - Increase Insulin in TPN to 140 units.
   - restart insulin drip today, plan to calculate needs in the context of
   decreasing TPN and increasing tube feeds
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - follow with serial exams and outlining
   - no therapy for now
   # FEN/GI:  BM this AM.  On TPN.  Has failed trophic tube feeds in past,
   restarted at 10 cc/hr [**10-5**], no residuals this AM with active bowel
   sounds
   - advance tube feeds per nutrition recs while decreasing TPN.  Goal is
   to be on tube feeds and off TPN over the weekend.
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - continue TPN without lipids, wean as increasing tube feeds.
   - continue bowel regimen with PR dulcolax, POG colace, senna,

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure. The patient's recent progress includes being afebrile for 48 hours, with stable WBC count. He has been weaned off pressors, and his blood cultures are all negative. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications. His condition is improving, with decreasing enzyme levels and clearing lung fields on imaging. The patient's current medical issues include hypoxic respiratory failure (ARDS), hypotension/septic shock, hyperglycemia, skin breakdown, acute renal failure (likely ATN), gallstone pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The plan moving forward includes weaning off sedation, continuing to wean ventilatory support, adjusting insulin therapy, monitoring for signs of infection, and managing the various complications mentioned above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure (ARDS): The patient may continue to experience difficulty in oxygenation due to the underlying lung injury. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilatory support will be necessary.

2. Hypotension/Sep tic Shock: Although the patient is currently afebrile and off"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  ARDS resolving, patient now able
   to be weaned from the ventilator, has done well with PS trials and is
   currently on [**7-22**].  ABG
s have been stable with decreases in PS.  Will
   wean further to [**4-18**] later this morning to see how patient tolerates
   further decreased in PEEP.  Plan for SBT later this afternoon with 0
   PEEP and possible extubation today or tomorrow morning depending on how
   he tolerates weaning of his PEEP.
   - Continue to wean sedation: will change to propofol gtt and add
   fentanyl boluses to wake him up significantly
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 72 hours, is having low grade
   temps, max 100.1.  WBC slightly increased from 14 to 16. Now on
   meropenem, vanc, micofungin. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed
   fungemia.  Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source
   of infection, no abscess formation.  Has been off pressors.
   - Is currently on vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and micafungin
   (day 1: [**2169-10-3**]).  (Cipro d/c
d [**10-5**]).  Will start to peel off
   antibiotics as per ID as long as he does not show any further signs of
   infection (leukocytosis, fever): will d/c micofungin today, monitor for
   24 hrs if no further signs of infection then d/c meropenem on [**10-8**],
   monitor x 24 hours, d/c vancomycin [**10-9**].
   - dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN, which is increased today
   - Increase Insulin in TPN to 170 units.
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is improving
   # FEN/GI:  Patient with more consistent BM
s today, but with increased
   residuals today, spoke with nutrition and changed to a more elemental
   tube feed that he may tolerate better, but he may end up needing a post
   pyloric feeding tube
   - Will advance tube feeds and once at goal will decrease TPN
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - continue TPN without lipids
   - will d/c erythromycin
   - continue bowel regimen with PR dulcolax, POG colace, senna as prn
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] now at a lower weight than on admission, per renal they feel
   his dry weight is close to 100 to 102 kg.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative -2 L daily
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos stable, elevated
   likely due to cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Patient
   will reach loading dose this afternoon, will d/c amio as patient has
   remained in SR
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.

   Code status: DNR / DNI- is currently intubated
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 139/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. His general appearance is sedated and intubated, with sclera icteric and scleral edema improved. Pupils are small and equal, mildly reactive, and there is a endotracheal tube in place.

His neck is supple, with jugular venous distention (JVD) difficult to assess due to neck edema. Lungs are clear bilaterally, with normal air movement. Heart sounds are regular, with a normal S1/S2, but difficult to appreciate for murmurs due to the sedation. Abdomen shows bowel sounds, decreased distension and tympanicity, some dullness to percussion at flanks and inferiorly, slightly improved from yesterday. Genitourinary examination reveals an erythematous, edematous scrotum, penis with scab/blister area at the base. Extremities"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  ARDS resolving, patient now able
   to be weaned from the ventilator, has done well with PS trials and is
   currently on [**7-22**].  ABG
s have been stable with decreases in PS.  Will
   wean further to [**4-18**] later this morning to see how patient tolerates
   further decreased in PEEP.  Plan for SBT later this afternoon with 0
   PEEP and possible extubation today or tomorrow morning depending on how
   he tolerates weaning of his PEEP.
   - Continue to wean sedation: will change to propofol gtt and add
   fentanyl boluses to wake him up significantly
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 72 hours, is having low grade
   temps, max 100.1.  WBC slightly increased from 14 to 16. Now on
   meropenem, vanc, micofungin. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed
   fungemia.  Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source
   of infection, no abscess formation.  Has been off pressors.
   - Is currently on vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and micafungin
   (day 1: [**2169-10-3**]).  (Cipro d/c
d [**10-5**]).  Will start to peel off
   antibiotics as per ID as long as he does not show any further signs of
   infection (leukocytosis, fever): will d/c micofungin today, monitor for
   24 hrs if no further signs of infection then d/c meropenem on [**10-8**],
   monitor x 24 hours, d/c vancomycin [**10-9**].
   - dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN, which is increased today
   - Increase Insulin in TPN to 170 units.
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is improving
   # FEN/GI:  Patient with more consistent BM
s today, but with increased
   residuals today, spoke with nutrition and changed to a more elemental
   tube feed that he may tolerate better, but he may end up needing a post
   pyloric feeding tube
   - Will advance tube feeds and once at goal will decrease TPN
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - continue TPN without lipids
   - will d/c erythromycin
   - continue bowel regimen with PR dulcolax, POG colace, senna as prn
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] now at a lower weight than on admission, per renal they feel
   his dry weight is close to 100 to 102 kg.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative -2 L daily
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos stable, elevated
   likely due to cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Patient
   will reach loading dose this afternoon, will d/c amio as patient has
   remained in SR
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   55 yo previously relatively healthy male p/w gall stone pancreatitis,
   now s/p ERCP with CBD stenting, whose course has been complicated by
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, now oliguric on CVVH for ARF.
   Has been doing better on vent on PSV 8/8 this AM. Sedation being weaned
   down to fentanyl drip +/- boluses for V/F. Still has vent
   dyssynchrony. Having regular bowel movements now after starting
   narcan/erythro. Having thick tan secretions. Remains on TPN.
   Tm 100.1, HR 90, BP 139/55, PS [**7-22**], FiO2 .4, RR 17. ABG 7.37/48/75.
   Last CVP 19. Bladder pressure down to 8 this AM. Sedated, eyes open,
   not tracking, MIP -50, Lungs
   Labs reviewed. WBC 16 (fluctuated 13-19). Cultures remain negative.
   Meds - amio drip, mycafungin 100 qd, fent, Vanc 1 gm q24 (dosed by
   level), insulin drip, erythro, [**Last Name (un) 350**], narcan PO q6h, famotidine in TPN,
   TF were at goal but had residuals and emesis this AM.
   Impression/Plan
   Acute resp failure, c/w PS wean, allow time for sedation to wash out
   before being able to extubate. Sedate with propofol drip and fent
   bolus. For sepsis, pancreatitis, necrotic pancreatitis, will continue
   with Vanc/Meropenem. Can d/c mycafungin today and observe. Renal
   failure - c/w diuresis on CVVHD.  re-advance TFs and will decrease or
   d/c TPN if reaches goal consistently. C/w insulin drip and monitor
   glycemic control. Was in afib, now sinus, completing amio load.
   DNR, not DNI. Patient is critically ill. Time spent 35 minutes.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is improving and able to be weaned from the ventilator. ABGs have been stable with decreases in PS. Plan for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) later this afternoon with 0 PEEP and possible extubation today or tomorrow morning depending on how he tolerates weaning of his PEEP.
- Hypotension/septic shock: The patient is afebrile for 72 hours, with low-grade temperatures. WBC slightly increased from 14 to 16. Currently on meropenem, vanc, and micafungin. Micafungin was added for presumed fungemia. Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source of infection, no abscess formation. Has been off pressors. Plan to start to peel off antibiotics as per ID as long as he does not show any further signs of infection.
- Hyperglycemia: The patient's sugars were in the 500's at the OSH, likely underlying type II diabetes. Controlled on an insulin gtt + insulin in TPN, which is increased today.
- Skin: Some bullous lesions on the left anterior/superior thigh where tape was previously placed. Erythematous blanching rash on the left flank, right lower extremity, and right upper extremity. Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis. Less likely drug rash without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia. Exam is improving.
- FEN/GI: The patient has more consistent bowel movements today, but with increased residuals today. Spoke with nutrition and changed to a more elemental tube feed that he may tolerate better, but he may end up needing a post pyloric feeding tube.
- Acute renal failure: Likely ATN. Started CVVH on 9/25. D/c on 9/27 for line kinking and pustular drainage around line. Re-started on 9/29 after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging filter. Re-started on 9/30 without any significant problems.
- Gallstone pancreatitis: CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow. Improving lipase and amylase. LFTs trending down. Alk phos stable, elevated likely due to cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
- Atrial fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Patient will reach loading dose this afternoon, will d/c amio as patient has remained in SR.
- Anemia: HCT stable.
- Thrombocytopenia: Resolved.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from an outside hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is being weaned off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient has been weaned from the ventilator and is currently on PS [7-22]. ABG results have been stable, and the plan is to further decrease PEEP and possibly extubate him today or tomorrow morning.

2. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient is afebrile for 72 hours, with low-grade temperatures. He is on meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin. Micafungin was added for presumed fungemia. Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but no other source of infection or abscess formation. He is currently off pressors.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient likely had underlying type II diabetes, as evidenced by sugars in the 500's at the outside hospital. His blood sugars are now in the 250's, and he is being controlled on an insulin gtt + insulin in TPN, now at 120 units. The plan is to increase the insulin in TPN to 140 units and restart the insulin drip today.

4. Skin: The patient has bullous lesions on his left anterior/superior thigh where tape was previously placed. He also has an erythematous blanching rash on his left flank and right lower extremity. These may be due to stasis dermatitis or drug rash, but no therapy is currently being given.

5. FEN/GI: The patient has had bowel movements and docusate has been held. He is on trophic tube feeds at 10 cc/hr and has active bowel sounds. The plan is to advance tube feeds per nutrition recommendations while decreasing TPN.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and started CVVH on [9-25]. He had a line kinking and pustular drainage around the line, which resulted in discontinuation of CVVH. New IR lines were placed, and CVVH was restarted on [9-29]. However, it only lasted 8 hours due to a clogged filter. CVVH was restarted again on [9-30] without any significant problems.

7. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient had a CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow. His lipase and amylase levels are improving, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma trasnferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  p/f ratio 325.  Was ventilated per
   ARDS protocol with goal minimize TV and PEEP to keep plateau pressures
   low, goal < 40, but lung fields largely clear on CT and CXR, so does
   not need ARDS protocol ventilation.  PS trial this am with TV
   650-700ml, minute vent 7-8.  Tolerated PEEP of 16, FiO2 of 40%, TV 450
   with RR 26.
   - PS trial today.  Check ABG.  If doing well, can leave on PS.  If
   needs assist control, will set higher TV to 500-550 and rate 20 to
   stimulate spontaneous breathing.
   - Continue to wean sedation.  Goal off fentanyl today, continue with
   methadone TID for sedation.
   - Haldol or propofol PRN for sedation in order to allow clearance of
   midazolam.
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 48 hours.  WBC stable. Now on
   meropenem, vanc, micofungin. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed
   fungemia.  Had been febrile and requiring pressors, but unable to find
   source
CT negative, CXR clear, cultures all negative. Lines changed
   [**9-29**].  Was on Zosyn initially, but now changed to meropenem and cipro
   and vanc for broader coverage.  Other sources: VAP (lungs clear on
   CXR/CT); Sinusitis: but patient is being treated for this and has had
   no more discharge from his nares. Intra-abdominal is a possibility, but
   CT negative.  Enzymes are all also trending down. C. diff negative.
   Fungemia possibility, given risk factors of nutrition with lipids and
   new rash, but B-glucan negative.  Overall, unclear picture of source.
   Other potential etiology of fever is ongoing pancreatitis.  Off
   pressors.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma, who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and mechanical ventilation. He is being treated for suspected sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin. The patient's recent laboratory results show stable white blood cell count, but elevated lactate levels. His blood glucose levels have been in the 500's, suggesting possible undiagnosed diabetes. The patient has also been experiencing hyperglycemia and has been managed with an insulin drip. The patient's skin condition includes bullous lesions on the thigh and a rash on the flank and lower extremities, which may be due to stasis dermatitis or medication reaction. The patient's gastrointestinal function is being supported with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and trophic tube feeds.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma transferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  ARDS resolving, patient now able
   to be weaned from the ventilator, has done well with PS trials and is
   currently on [**7-22**].  ABG
s have been stable with decreases in PS.  Will
   wean further to [**4-18**] later this morning to see how patient tolerates
   further decreased in PEEP.  Plan for SBT later this afternoon with 0
   PEEP and possible extubation today or tomorrow morning depending on how
   he tolerates weaning of his PEEP.
   - Continue to wean sedation: will change to propofol gtt and add
   fentanyl boluses to wake him up significantly
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 72 hours, is having low grade
   temps, max 100.1.  WBC slightly increased from 14 to 16. Now on
   meropenem, vanc, micofungin. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed
   fungemia.  Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source
   of infection, no abscess formation.  Has been off pressors.
   - Is currently on vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and micafungin
   (day 1: [**2169-10-3**]).  (Cipro d/c
d [**10-5**]).  Will start to peel off
   antibiotics as per ID as long as he does not show any further signs of
   infection (leukocytosis, fever): will d/c micofungin today, monitor for
   24 hrs if no further signs of infection then d/c meropenem on [**10-8**],
   monitor x 24 hours, d/c vancomycin [**10-9**].
   - dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN, which is increased today
   - Increase Insulin in TPN to 170 units.
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is improving
   # FEN/GI:  Patient with more consistent BM
s today, but with increased
   residuals today, spoke with nutrition and changed to a more elemental
   tube feed that he may tolerate better, but he may end up needing a post
   pyloric feeding tube
   - Will advance tube feeds and once at goal will decrease TPN
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - continue TPN without lipids
   - will d/c erythromycin
   - continue bowel regimen with PR dulcolax, POG colace, senna as prn
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] now at a lower weight than on admission, per renal they feel
   his dry weight is close to 100 to 102 kg.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative -2 L daily
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos stable, elevated
   likely due to cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Patient
   will reach loading dose this afternoon, will d/c amio as patient has
   remained in SR
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma. He was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for worsening gallstone pancreatitis that led to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is resolving. He has been doing well with partial support ventilation (PSV) trials and is currently on PS 5/5. ABGs have been stable with decreases in PS. The plan is to wean further to PS 4-18 later this morning to see how the patient tolerates the decreased PEEP. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be performed later this afternoon with 0 PEEP and possible extubation today or tomorrow morning depending on the patient's response to weaning of PEEP.

The patient's sedation will be continued with propofol infusion and fentanyl boluses to wake him up significantly. 

The patient is afebrile for 72 hours, with low-grade temperatures. His WBC count is slightly increased from 14 to 16. He is currently on meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin. Micafungin was added on day 1 for presumed fungemia. A recent CT scan showed"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma transferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:  ARDS resolving, patient now able
   to be weaned from the ventilator, has done well with PS trials and is
   currently on [**7-22**].  ABG
s have been stable with decreases in PS.  Will
   wean further to [**4-18**] later this morning to see how patient tolerates
   further decreased in PEEP.  Plan for SBT later this afternoon with 0
   PEEP and possible extubation today or tomorrow morning depending on how
   he tolerates weaning of his PEEP.
   - Continue to wean sedation: will change to propofol gtt and add
   fentanyl boluses to wake him up significantly
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:  Afebrile x 72 hours, is having low grade
   temps, max 100.1.  WBC slightly increased from 14 to 16. Now on
   meropenem, vanc, micofungin. Micofungin added [**10-3**] for presumed
   fungemia.  Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source
   of infection, no abscess formation.  Has been off pressors.
   - Is currently on vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**]), and micafungin
   (day 1: [**2169-10-3**]).  (Cipro d/c
d [**10-5**]).  Will start to peel off
   antibiotics as per ID as long as he does not show any further signs of
   infection (leukocytosis, fever): will d/c micofungin today, monitor for
   24 hrs if no further signs of infection then d/c meropenem on [**10-8**],
   monitor x 24 hours, d/c vancomycin [**10-9**].
   - dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on an insulin gtt +
   insulin in TPN, which is increased today
   - Increase Insulin in TPN to 170 units.
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is improving
   # FEN/GI:  Patient with more consistent BM
s today, but with increased
   residuals today, spoke with nutrition and changed to a more elemental
   tube feed that he may tolerate better, but he may end up needing a post
   pyloric feeding tube
   - Will advance tube feeds and once at goal will decrease TPN
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - continue TPN without lipids
   - will d/c erythromycin
   - continue bowel regimen with PR dulcolax, POG colace, senna as prn
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] now at a lower weight than on admission, per renal they feel
   his dry weight is close to 100 to 102 kg.
   - Continue CVVHD as tolerated and advance rate as tolerated. Goal
   negative -2 L daily
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs trending down.  Alk phos stable, elevated
   likely due to cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient on amio gtt in sinus rhythm. Patient
   will reach loading dose this afternoon, will d/c amio as patient has
   remained in SR
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. 

The patient has been on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) due to acute renal failure. His blood cultures showed no signs of infection, so micafungin was discontinued. The patient's antibiotics will be tapered off as per the Infectious Disease (ID) recommendation, monitoring for any signs of infection such as leukocytosis or fever. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly, and he is now able to be weaned from the ventilator. He is currently on PSV (pressure support ventilation) mode and has done well. The plan is to further wean the ventilator by decreasing PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) and possibly extubate him today or tomorrow morning, depending on how he tolerates the weaning process.

The patient's skin condition is improving, with resolving bullous lesions and erythematous blanching rash on the flank. These were initially suspected to be related to a fungal infection, but a CT scan and B-glucan test were negative, and the dermatologist declined to perform a biopsy. 

The patient's hyperglycemia is being managed with an insulin gtt + insulin in T"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma transferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:
   ARDS resolving, patient did well on PS 5/5 this morning.  ABGs have
   been stable with decreases in PS.  Plan for SBT later this afternoon
   with 0 PEEP and possible extubation today or tomorrow morning depending
   on how he tolerates weaning of his PEEP.
   - do SBT today w propofol weaned off ; try waking him up in afternoon
   - barriers to extubation = Mental Status
 not ready for extubation
   today for that reason
   - contact HCP about whether pt should be reintubated should he fail
   extubation
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:   Pt continues to have low grade temps,
   max 100.1.  WBC decreased to 9.9 from 16.  No culture growth to date;
   patient may not have actually had septic shock, but distributive shock
   of other etiology.  Continues on meropenem, vanc; Micofungin was D/Ced
   [**10-7**] ( had been added [**10-3**] for presumed fungemia).  Recent CT showed
   necrotic pancreas but with no other source of infection, no abscess
   formation.  Has been stable off pressors.
   - Abx regimen:  vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**])
 will D/C meropenem
   today, then likely D/C vancomycin tomorrow, following ID recs as long
   as he shows no further signs of infection
   - dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on insulin in TPN ;
   insulin gtt DCed.
   - cont to monitor , particularly after transition from TPN to tube
   feeds
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is stable/improving
   # FEN/GI:  Patient with more consistent BMs today; trying new tube
   feeds w less lipids to see if residuals improve today. Erythromycin
   DCed yesterday b/c did not seem to be helping
   - may end up needing a post pyloric feeding tube
   - Will advance tube feeds and once at goal will decrease TPN
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - continue TPN
 can likely add back lipids for tomorrow
s TPN
   - continue bowel regimen with PR dulcolax, POG colace, senna as prn
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.   [**Name (NI) 6**] had
   intermittent filter clogging problems w CVVH including last night
   - CVVH again today, then switch to HD tomorrow
   - Patient now at a lower weight than on admission, but he presented
   from outside hospital already 8-10L up; Renal team feels his dry weight
   is close to 100 to 102 kg.
   - Continue CVVHD today -- Goal negative -2 L today
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs stable, normalized.  Alk phos still elevated
   but stable, and T Bili trending down.  Alk phos elevated likely due to
   cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm w rate in 90s.  Reached
   loading dose on [**10-6**], so amio gtt was DCed, but loading dose should
   stay in his system for a while.
   - cont to monitor and may start home calcium channel blocker
   .
   # Anemia: HCT drop to 23 this AM, but repeat is 26, so did not
   transfuse.  Will need to cont to monitor.
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis that led to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 133/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and intubated, with an endotracheal tube in place. He is receiving mechanical ventilation in the assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 351 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 59.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 256 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 1.0 mmol/L, and decreased platelet count at 256 platelets/uL. Blood cultures have been negative so far. The patient's blood glucose levels are in the 500's, indicating hyperglycemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals sclera icterus, scleral edema, small and equal pupils that are"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo previously relatively healthy male p/w gall stone pancreatitis,
   now s/p ERCP with CBD stenting, whose course has been complicated by
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, now oliguric on CVVH for ARF.
   Impression/Plan
   Acute resp failure, c/w PS wean, tolerating PS 5/5, allow time for
   sedation to wash out before being able to extubate. C/w with propofol
   drip and fent boluses.
   Sepsis, pancreatitis, necrotic pancreatitis - will continue with Vanc
   and d/c Meropenem today. Mycafungin was d/c'd yesterday.
   Renal failure - c/w diuresis on CVVHD with HD likely Monday.
   Ileus/Nutrition - re-advance TFs with goal of decreasing or d/c TPN if
   reaches goal consistently. C/w insulin drip and monitor glycemic
   control. Was in afib, now sinus, completing amio load.
   Anemia - watch hct +/- transfuse. tolerate Hct at 23 but would
   transfuse if drops further.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis who underwent ERCP with CBD stenting. The patient's course has been complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF), for which he is currently oliguric on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 183/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on supplemental oxygen. He is sedated and not following commands.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine, and altered liver function tests. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions and smaller lung volumes.

The patient's medical conditions include acute respiratory failure, sepsis, necrotic pancreatitis, renal failure, ileus/nutrition, anemia, and DNR status. The plan is to continue with vancomycin and discontinue meropenem. CVVH will be continued, and the patient's ileus and nutrition will be managed accordingly. Close monitoring of glycemic control and hemoglobin levels is recommended.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to prolonged sedation and immobility, further deterioration of renal function"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   patient able to be weaned, currently on PSV 8/5 and doing well, plan
   for SBT in the morning after we d/c propofol, ? extubation
   - CVVH machine clotted again and machine [**Location (un) 118**] fluid positive, spoke
   with renal, will hold off on more CVVH tonight and they will see early
   in the morning tomorrow, ? possible HD instead
   - patient currently close to admission weight, per renal they feel his
   dry weight is 100-102kg
   - need to contact HCP prior to extubation re: reintubation if he fails
   - pt does have baseline HTN; consider starting IV dilt Q6h?... because
   he can sometimes go up to 180s systolic, esp on CVVH; starting HD [**Doctor First Name 600**]
   which could drop his BPs.  Some of his high BPs could be related to his
   agitation when less sedated
   - tried one time dose of 60mg Dilt when SBP 180s on CVVH to see how he
   absorbs the dilt -- didn't have any effect within 1hr, but SBP up to
   190s, so gave 10mg IV hydralazine x1--> didn't work... so gave 5mg IV
   metoprolol --> responded well w BPs in 150s
   - started metoprolol PO 12.5mg TID w high holding parameters
   - can add back lipids to TPN for tomorrow's order (had DCed lipids
   previously b/c we thought he might have had fungemia)
   - new tube feeds today have less lipids (he was switched b/c nutrition
   thought maybe high residuals were a result of difficulty digesting
   lipids from tube feeds)
   - Barrier to extubation is Mental statuS!  so if his mental status
   improves, then we will stop tube feeds for extubation (b/c o/w we
   consistently stop tube feeds after midnight for ""possib"" extubation and
   dont extubate for days)
   - tolerated PS 5/5 since 4am [**10-8**] to about 5:30pm --> put him back on
   PS [**9-23**] to rest him a bit overnight b/c he was becoming more
   tachypneic but looks rested on PS [**9-23**], also increased the propofol
   slightly (which also helped the BPs)

   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma transferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:
   ARDS resolving, patient did well on PS 5/5 this morning.  ABGs have
   been stable with decreases in PS.  Plan for SBT later this afternoon
   with 0 PEEP and possible extubation today or tomorrow morning depending
   on how he tolerates weaning of his PEEP.
   - do SBT today w propofol weaned off ; try waking him up in afternoon
   - barriers to extubation = Mental Status
 not ready for extubation
   today for that reason
   - contact HCP about whether pt should be reintubated should he fail
   extubation
   .
    # Hypotension/Septic Shock:   Pt continues to have low grade temps,
   max 100.1.  WBC decreased to 9.9 from 16.  No culture growth to date;
   patient may not have actually had septic shock, but distributive shock
   of other etiology.  Continues on meropenem, vanc; Micofungin was D/Ced
   [**10-7**] ( had been added [**10-3**] for presumed fungemia).  Recent CT showed
   necrotic pancreas but with no other source of infection, no abscess
   formation.  Has been stable off pressors.
   - Abx regimen:  vanc, meropenem (day 1: [**2169-9-29**])
 will D/C meropenem
   today, then likely D/C vancomycin tomorrow, following ID recs as long
   as he shows no further signs of infection
   - dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on insulin in TPN ;
   insulin gtt DCed.
   - cont to monitor , particularly after transition from TPN to tube
   feeds
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is stable/improving
   # FEN/GI:  Patient with more consistent BMs today; trying new tube
   feeds w less lipids to see if residuals improve today. Erythromycin
   DCed yesterday b/c did not seem to be helping
   - may end up needing a post pyloric feeding tube
   - Will advance tube feeds and once at goal will decrease TPN
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - continue TPN
 can likely add back lipids for tomorrow
s TPN
   - continue bowel regimen with PR dulcolax, POG colace, senna as prn
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.   [**Name (NI) 6**] had
   intermittent filter clogging problems w CVVH including last night
   - CVVH again today, then switch to HD tomorrow
   - Patient now at a lower weight than on admission, but he presented
   from outside hospital already 8-10L up; Renal team feels his dry weight
   is close to 100 to 102 kg.
   - Continue CVVHD today -- Goal negative -2 L today
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs stable, normalized.  Alk phos still elevated
   but stable, and T Bili trending down.  Alk phos elevated likely due to
   cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm w rate in 90s.  Reached
   loading dose on [**10-6**], so amio gtt was DCed, but loading dose should
   stay in his system for a while.
   - cont to monitor and may start home calcium channel blocker
   .
   # Anemia: HCT drop to 23 this AM, but repeat is 26, so did not
   transfuse.  Will need to cont to monitor.
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, which led to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. Currently, he is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure.

The patient has shown improvements in his respiratory status, with stable ABGs and decreases in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) later today with propofol weaned off, and possible extubation today or tomorrow morning depending on how he tolerates weaning of his PEEP.

The patient's hypotension and septic shock are being managed with appropriate antibiotic therapy. The recent CT scan showed necrotic pancreas but no other source of infection or abscess formation. The patient is expected to be stable off pressors.

The patient's hyperglycemia is controlled on insulin in total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and the insulin gtt is to be discontinued. The skin findings include bullous lesions and an erythematous blanching rash, which are likely due to stasis dermatitis.

Regarding the gastrointestinal system, the patient has more consistent bowel movements today, and new tube feeds with less lipids are being tried to improve residuals. Erythromycin was discontinued yesterday as it did not seem to be helping. The possibility of"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with pmh of HTN and asthma transferred from an OSH for
   worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by
   hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure currently
   on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure/ARDS:
   ARDS resolving, patient did well on PS 5/5 this morning.  ABGs have
   been stable with decreases in PS.
   - Plan to decrease sedation and give patient a few days before
   extubation for sedative clearance
   - barriers to extubation = Mental Status
 not ready for extubation
   today for that reason
   - contact HCP about whether pt should be reintubated should he fail
   extubation
   .
    # Septic/ Distributive Shock:   Pt has low grade temps- 99, could be
   [**1-16**] inflammation from necrotic pancreas, unlikely new focus of
   infection, as WBC trending down,  no culture growth to data.  Recent CT
   showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source of infection, no
   abscess formation.  Has been stable off pressors.
   - Abx regimen:  [**Last Name (un) 350**] D/C
d [**9-8**], D/C Vanc today ([**9-9**])
   - dose all Abx with a CrCl of < 30 while on CVVH per Renal
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes.  Controlled on insulin in TPN ;
   insulin gtt DCed.
   - cont to monitor , particularly after transition from TPN to tube
   feeds
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is stable/improving
   # FEN/GI:  Patient with more consistent BMs today; trying new tube
   feeds w less lipids to see if residuals improve today. Erythromycin
   DCed yesterday b/c did not seem to be helping
   - may end up needing a post pyloric feeding tube
   - Will advance tube feeds and once at goal will decrease TPN
   - check residuals Q 4 hrs
   - d/c TPN once tolerating Tube Feeds, pt gets 160u insulin in TPN so
   expect hyperglycemia on TF
   - continue bowel regimen with PR dulcolax, POG colace, senna as prn
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.   [**Name (NI) 6**] had
   intermittent filter clogging problems w CVVH including last night
   - CVVH again today, then switch to HD tomorrow
   - Patient now at a lower weight than on admission, but he presented
   from outside hospital already 8-10L up; Renal team feels his dry weight
   is close to 100 to 102 kg.
   - Continue CVVHD today -- Goal negative -2 L today
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs stable, normalized.  Alk phos still elevated
   but stable, and T Bili trending down.  Alk phos elevated likely due to
   cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm w rate in 90s.  Reached
   loading dose on [**10-6**], so amio gtt was DCed, but loading dose should
   stay in his system for a while.
   - cont to monitor and may start home calcium channel blocker
   - increase metoprolol to 25 mg TID
   .
   # Anemia: HCT drop to 23 this AM, but repeat is 26, so did not
   transfuse.  Will need to cont to monitor.
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25

   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: DNR , currently intubated ; need to touch base w HCP
   regarding re-intubation if fails extubation
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis that led to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to oliguric acute renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 133/57 mmHg to 195/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's mental status is a barrier to extubation, and the healthcare provider needs to be contacted regarding reintubation if extubation fails. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, and he is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube on CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode.

The patient's abdomen is soft, distended, and tympanic to percussion with hypoactive bowel sounds. He has right and left lower extremity edema, but no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically, the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and responds inadequately.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.9 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine levels, and hyperglycemia with blood glucose levels in the 500's. The patient's platelet count is 284 thousand/mm3, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 47 mg/dL.

The patient's current plan involves weaning off propofol and starting a spontaneous breathing trial in the morning. The CVVH machine clotted again, so it will be held off tonight, and the patient may switch to hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 6,393 mL and output of 7,965 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,572 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include reintubation if the patient fails extubation, ongoing management of acute renal failure, and monitoring for any signs of infection or sepsis."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. His primary obstacle to extubation is altered mental status. The patient is tolerating intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) mode and has shown some improvement. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure attributed to sepsis and altered mental status. Monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation are ongoing.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved but should be closely monitored to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
3. Sepsis: Although improved, the patient should be monitored for any signs of sepsis recurrence. Antibiotics should be completed as prescribed.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is attributed to medications. Close monitoring is necessary, and adjustments to medication doses may be required.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels should be monitored, and efforts should be made to maintain them below 150 mg/dL.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is tolerating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and may require further hemodialysis.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure currently on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   - Patient doing well on PS 5/5.  ABGs have been stable with decreases
   in PS.
   - Off all sedation, will give patient a day or so before extubation for
   sedative clearance
   - barriers to extubation = Mental Status
 not ready for extubation
   today for that reason
   - contact HCP about whether pt should be reintubated should he fail
   extubation
   .
    # Septic/ Distributive Shock:   Pt has low grade temps- 99, could be
   [**1-16**] inflammation from necrotic pancreas, unlikely new focus of
   infection, as WBC trending down,  no culture growth to data.  Recent CT
   showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source of infection, no
   abscess formation.  Has been stable off pressors.
   - Currently off all Abx
   - will need to monitor closely for infx
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient does not have known history of diabetes,
   however was found to have sugars in the 500's at the OSH so he likely
   had underlying type II diabetes
   - now off TPN w/ insulin, monitor blood glucose carefully on TF
   -  FS have been trending up to 300s, got 8 [**Location 9611**] this AM
   - will cover w/ short acting insulin to obtain daily insulin need, then
   titrate appropriately
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is stable/improving
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.   [**Name (NI) 6**] had
   intermittent filter clogging problems w CVVH including last night
   - CVVH again today
   - pt at -5 L
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs stable, normalized.  Alk phos still elevated
   but stable, and T Bili trending down.  Alk phos elevated likely due to
   cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm w rate in 90s.  Reached
   loading dose on [**10-6**], so amio gtt was DCed, but loading dose should
   stay in his system for a while.
   - cont to monitor and may start home calcium channel blocker
   - increased metoprolol to 25 mg TID [**10-9**]
   .
   # Anemia: Will need to cont to monitor, stable for now
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25

   Disposition :ICU
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and has been stable off pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's mental status is not ready for extubation, and there is a concern about reintubation if he fails extubation.

2. Septic/distributive shock: Although the patient is currently stable off pressors, there is a need to monitor closely for any signs of infection or new focus of infection. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and no culture growth has been observed so far. A recent CT scan showed necrotic pancreas but no other source of infection or abscess formation.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high fasting blood sugar levels, indicating likely underlying type II diabetes. Insulin therapy will be initiated to control blood glucose levels.

4. Skin issues: The patient has bullous lesions on the left anterior/superior thigh where tape was previously placed, and an erythematous blanching rash on the left flank, right lower extremity, and right upper extremity. These rashes may be due to stasis dermatitis or"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure currently on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   - Patient doing well on PS 5/5.  ABGs have been stable with decreases
   in PS.
   - Off all sedation, will give patient a day or so before extubation for
   sedative clearance
   - will check ABG and VBG correlation
   - barriers to extubation = Mental Status
 not ready for extubation
   today for that reason
   - contact HCP (attorney) about whether pt should be reintubated should
   he fail extubation
   .
    # Septic/ Distributive Shock:   Pt has low grade temps 100.1 axillary
   which correlates to approx 101 oral. This could be [**1-16**] inflammation
   from necrotic pancreas or new source of infection, given multiple lines
   and off all Abx as of yesterday. Of note, some erythema around IJ,
   which could be possible source. Pneumonia is another possibility.
   Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source of
   infection but no abscess formation.  Has been stable off pressors.
   - send BCx, UCx and cx of oral secretions
   - portable CXR today to assess for any areas of consolidation vs.
   atelectasis
   - consider repeat CT abdomen pending CXR, culture, clinical status
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - f/u any pending ID recs-> any infx source consider starting
   vancomycin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Likely due to poorly functioning pancreas given
   necrosis and markedly stenotic splenic vein
   -  on TF, expected to be hyperglycemic (as was getting 160u insulin in
   TPN)
   -  FS have been trending up to 300s, received 8 [**Location 9611**] this AM
   -  will cover w/ short acting insulin to obtain daily insulin need,
   then titrate appropriately
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is stable/improving
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma.
- He was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure.
- The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has had multiple lines placed.
- He has low-grade fever, which could indicate inflammation from a necrotic pancreas or a new source of infection.
- The patient has been extubated but may require reintubation if he fails to wean off mechanical ventilation.
- His mental status remains poor, and he is not yet ready for extubation.
- He has hyperglycemia due to poorly functioning pancreas and stenotic splenic vein.
- The patient has bullous lesions on his thigh and a rash on his flank, which may be stasis dermatitis or drug rash.
- He has acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and CVVH has been restarted after initial issues with line kinking and clogging.
- The patient's gallstone pancreatitis is improving with the placement of a CBD stent.
- He had atrial fibrillation but is now in sinus rhythm.
- Anemia is present and needs"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yom gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal
   failure and persistent altered mental status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis, altered mental status,
   volume resussitation.  Underlying asthma.  Good progress.  Plan to
   continue to move towards extubation trial as mental status improves.
   HYPOTENSION -- improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- improved.  Monitor. Antimicrobials completed.
   FEVER -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to underlying pancreatitis.  However,
   need to continue monitor for signs of complication of pancreatitis
   (pseudocyst, hemorrhage) or new infection (VAP, line-related infection,
   urine source, C. diff, hepatobilliary infection), or non-infectious
   causes (DVT, drug-related fever).  Evaluation in progress.  Cultures
   submitted.  D/c lines if possible.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to medications
 slow clearance.
   Improvement continues, although slow.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- monitor glucose.  Maintain <150.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Tolerating CVVHD, consider
   hemodialysis.
   PANCREATITIS -- ACUTE, attributed to galllstone.  s/p ERCP stent
   placement.  Monitor exam, LFTs, amylase, lipase.
   FLUIDS -- hyperexpanded.  Continue net removal.  Aim for 1-2 L/day.
   Monitor I/O.
   BULLOUS LESIONS, Left THIGH --  exam is stable or improving
   A-FIB -- now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium
   channel blocker.
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal failure and persistent altered mental status. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. He is somewhat more awake and responding to questions with eye-blinking. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 131/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated lactate levels, and other abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to sepsis, altered mental status, and volume resuscitation. The underlying asthma should also be considered. The plan is to continue moving towards extubation trial as mental status improves.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved but should be monitored, and blood pressure should be maintained at a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.

3. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has improved, it should continue to be monitored. Antimicrobials have been completed, and cultures have been submitted. If possible, lines should be decannulated.

   Chief Complaint:  transfer for worsening gallstone pancreatitis for
   ERCP
   .
   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 9314**] is a 55 yo male with pmh of htn
   and COPD trasnferred from an OSH for worsening pancreatitis complicated
   by hypoxia, hypotension, and acute renal failure.  Prior to admission
   the patient had had intermittent abdominal pain.  Last Thursday he
   developed severe abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting and
   went to [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital.  He was found to have a CBD stone and
   associated pancreatitis on CT.  He was admitted and medically treated
   for pancreatitis with IVF.  The day prior to transfer he was found to
   have blood sugars in the 500's and hyperkalemia.  He was started on an
   insulin gtt and transferred to the ICU.  He became tachycardic and his
   UOP decreased although at that time his SBPs remained stable.  He was
   given IVFs.  Over the course of the day he became more tachypneic and
   tachycardic and was placed on a NRB.  He also became delirious and
   agitated and was intubated the morning of transfer.  After intbuation
   his SBPs dropped to the 60's and he was given more IVF with some
   improvement.  He has had verly little urine output since intubation.
   .
   When he left the OSH he was on an insulin gtt, propofol, but not on
   pressors.  He has a Right subclavian CVL and an arterial line.  Prior
   to transfer he was on PS 28/8 on FiO2 of 100% with an ABG of
   7.26/74/71.
   .
   During the [**Location (un) 1064**] his insulin gtt was stopped and he had a FS
   checked within the high 100s.  He became difficult to ventilate with
   PIPs in the 50's and was changed to AC.  He was briefly hypotensive and
   was placed on levo, however this was stopped before he arrived at the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].
   .
   On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] his sats were in the mid 80's.  He was
   normotensive and tachycardic.

   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure currently on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   - Patient doing well on PS 5/5.  ABGs have been stable with decreases
   in PS.
   - Off all sedation, will give patient a day or so before extubation for
   sedative clearance
   - will check ABG and VBG correlation
   - barriers to extubation = Mental Status
 not ready for extubation
   today for that reason
   - contact HCP (attorney) about whether pt should be reintubated should
   he fail extubation
   .
    # Septic/ Distributive Shock:   Pt has low grade temps 100.1 axillary
   which correlates to approx 101 oral. This could be [**1-16**] inflammation
   from necrotic pancreas or new source of infection, given multiple lines
   and off all Abx as of yesterday. Of note, some erythema around IJ,
   which could be possible source. Pneumonia is another possibility.
   Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source of
   infection but no abscess formation.  Has been stable off pressors.
   - send BCx, UCx and cx of oral secretions
   - portable CXR today to assess for any areas of consolidation vs.
   atelectasis
   - consider repeat CT abdomen pending CXR, culture, clinical status
   - f/u remaining culture data
all NGTD
   - foley changed ([**9-28**]); New lines placed [**2169-9-29**]
   - f/u any pending ID recs-> any infx source consider starting
   vancomycin
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Likely due to poorly functioning pancreas given
   necrosis and markedly stenotic splenic vein
   -  on TF, expected to be hyperglycemic (as was getting 160u insulin in
   TPN)
   -  FS have been trending up to 300s, received 8 [**Location 9611**] this AM
   -  will cover w/ short acting insulin to obtain daily insulin need,
   then titrate appropriately
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is stable/improving
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. Started CVVH [**9-25**].  D/c
d [**9-27**]
   for line kinking and pustular drainage around line.  Re-started [**9-29**]
   after new IR lines placed, but only lasted 8 hours due to clogging
   filter. Re-started [**9-30**] without any significant problems.   [**Name (NI) 6**] had
   intermittent filter clogging problems w CVVH including last night
   - CVVH again today
   - Renal feels patient ok for HD, plan for HD tmrw
   - appreciate renal recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  Improving
   lipase and amylase.   LFTs stable, normalized.  Alk phos still elevated
   but stable, and T Bili trending down.  Alk phos elevated likely due to
   cholestasis (atonic GB) + TPN.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes QOD
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm w rate in 90s.  Reached
   loading dose on [**10-6**], so amio gtt was DCed, but loading dose should
   stay in his system for a while.
   - cont to monitor and may start home calcium channel blocker
   - increased metoprolol to 25 mg TID [**10-9**]
   .
   # Anemia: Will need to cont to monitor, stable for now
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25

   Disposition :ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and COPD. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, which has led to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). He is also experiencing impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. However, there is a need to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has low-grade fever and erythema around the internal jugular (IJ) vein, which could indicate inflammation or infection. Pneumonia and necrotic pancreas are also possible sources of infection. Further investigation, including sending blood cultures (BCx), urine cultures (UCx), and cultures of oral secretions, as well as a portable chest X-ray, is needed to identify any areas of consolidation or atelectasis. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen may be necessary pending the results of the CXR and cultures.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is currently on CVVH. The renal team recommends"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had low grade fevers with rectal temperature 100.2F.
   Blood, urine, sputum cultures obtained.  The patient was continued on
   CVVH until 10 a.m. today (total period of 72 hours).  Arterial line was
   d/c
d and sent for culture.
   ET tube was noted to be 8 cm above carina and was advanced 2 cm by
   respiratory.
   At 1 a.m., pt. was noted to be transiently tachypneic, diaphoretic,
   respiratory therapy increased pressure support [**9-18**] with immediate
   improvement.  VBG at that time was 7.42/49/40. This morning blood
   glucose was high as 480 despite increased sliding scale and additional
   Humalog SC , sliding scale was d/c
d and the patient was  started on
   IV insulin, Lantus increased to 30 units qAM.
   This morning the patient again became transiently diaphoretic,
   tachycardic and tachypneic on PS 5/5 and PS was increased to [**9-18**] with
   subsequent resolution of symptoms.  Axillary temperature was 100.6F
   while on CVVH.  The patient is overall significantly more alert, able
   to respond to voice commands.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure currently on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   - Patient with increased vent requirement today, despite being more
   alert with improved neurological exam.  As a consequence, he is not
   ready for extubation at this point.  Coupled with fevers and
   radiographic evidence of increased opacity on CXR, may represent VAP.
   - Start empiric treatment for VAP as below, assess for VAP or other
   acute pulmonary process with non-contrast chest CT, mini-BAL
   - Decrease PS as tolerated
   .
    # Fevers:   Pt with low grade temps up to 100.6F axillary despite
   being on CVVH.  Etiology is unclear, but may represent acute pulmonary
   process (VAP), line infection, or could be be [**1-16**] inflammation from
   necrotic pancreas.  The patient has been off all Abx for the past 2d.
    Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source of
   infection but no abscess formation.  Howver, LFTs have been trending
   up.  The patient continued to be hemodynamically stable off pressors.
   - F/u BCx, HD line culture, A-line cath VAP
   - Start the pt. on empiric treatment for VAP with Vanc, Zosyn and Cipro
   -If no obvious lung process is identified on CT, will replace lines and
   give pt. line holiday.
   - consider repeat CT abdomen  if LFTs continue to trend up
   - Appreciate continued ID recs
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Likely due to poorly functioning pancreas given
   necrosis and markedly stenotic splenic vein.  Marked hyperglycemia this
   AM, the patient started on IV Insulin and increased dose of Lantus.
   Expected to be hyperglycemic, as was previously getting 160 units of
   Lantus with TPN.
   - Will uptitrate as needed to keep BGs under 200.  Will monitor IV
   insulin requirements today and adjust Lantus dose accordingly.
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is stable/improving
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. CVVH stopped this AM after 72
   hours.  Per renal recs, will start HD tomorrow
   - appreciate continued renal recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  LFTs
   trended up mildly this AM. Alk phos  and TBili still elevated but
   stable, likely secondary to cholestasis.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes daily
   - Will perform CT abdomen if LFTs continue to trend up.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm w rate in 90s.  Reached
   loading dose on [**10-6**], so amio gtt was DCed, but loading dose should
   stay in his system for a while.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, hyperglycemia, anemia, and acute renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has increased ventilator requirements, is not ready for extubation, and has radiographic evidence of increased opacity on chest X-ray, which may represent VAP. Empiric treatment for VAP has been started, and further assessment with non-contrast chest CT and mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is planned.

2. Line infection: The patient's fevers and elevated white blood cell count may indicate a line infection. Blood cultures from the hemodialysis line and arterial line catheter tip are pending.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric acute renal failure and is currently on CVVH. The plan is to start hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels are likely due to a poorly functioning pancreas secondary to necrotic"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yom gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal
   failure and persistent altered mental status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis, altered mental status,
   volume resussitation.  Underlying asthma.  Good progress overall, but
   now with evidence for new RLL infiltate (probale VAP).  Plan initiate
   empirical antimictobials directed to VAP pathogens.   Continue to move
   towards extubation trial as mental status improves.
   FEVER -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to underlying pancreatitis.  However,
   need to continue monitor for signs of complication of pancreatitis
   (pseudocyst, hemorrhage) or new infection (VAP, line-related infection,
   urine source, C. diff, hepatobilliary infection), or non-infectious
   causes (DVT, drug-related fever).  Evaluation in progress.  Cultures
   submitted.  D/c lines if possible.
   HYPOTENSION -- improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE
 RLL; concern for aspiration or evolving VAP.  At
   risk for atalectasis.  In context of recurrent fevers, would favor
   empirical treatment for VAP, pending evaluation.
   SEPSIS -- Resolved.  Biliiary system drained internally.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to medications --> slow clearance.
   Improvement continues, overall.
   CONJUNCTIVAL INJECTION, left -- conjunctivitis, possible contact, but
   concern for infectious conjunctivitis.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Now on insulin drip.  Monitor glucose.  Maintain <150.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Completed CVVHD -->
   hemodialysis to begin tomorrow, if indicated.
   PANCREATITIS -- ACUTE, attributed to galllstone.  s/p ERCP stent
   placement.  Monitor exam, LFTs, amylase, lipase.
   FLUIDS -- hyperexpanded.  Continue net removal.  Aim for 1-2 L/day.
   Monitor I/O.
   A-FIB -- now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium
   channel blocker.
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   BULLOUS LESIONS, Left THIGH --  exam is stable or improving.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal failure and persistent altered mental status. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient experienced transient increased dyspnea last evening, requiring increased inspiratory pressure settings. This morning, he appears more awake and is able to move his fingers, toes, and legs.

His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV+Apnea Pres mode ventilation. His central venous pressure is 12 mmHg, and he has received a total of 9,662 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 7,849 mL given intravenously.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the development of new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which is likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His physical examination shows left conjunctival injection and right lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.2 x 10^9/L, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 27 mEq/L, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 401 mg/dL, and acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL. Imaging reveals new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure attributed to sepsis, altered mental status, and volume resuscitation. The patient has underlying asthma. There is evidence for new RLL infiltrate (probable VAP), so empirical antimicrobials should be initiated. The patient is being moved towards extubation trial as mental status improves.

Other issues include fever, hypotension, pulmonary infiltrate RLL, sepsis, altered mental status, conjunctival injection, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, pancreatitis, and fluid overload. The patient's condition requires close monitoring for complications such as pseudocyst, hemorrhage, DVT, drug-related fever, and non-infectious causes.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yom gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal
   failure and persistent altered mental status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis, altered mental status,
   volume resussitation.  Underlying asthma.  Good progress overall, but
   now with evidence for new RLL infiltate (probale VAP).  Plan initiate
   empirical antimictobials directed to VAP pathogens.   Continue to move
   towards extubation trial as mental status improves.
   FEVER -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to underlying pancreatitis.  However,
   need to continue monitor for signs of complication of pancreatitis
   (pseudocyst, hemorrhage) or new infection (VAP, line-related infection,
   urine source, C. diff, hepatobilliary infection), or non-infectious
   causes (DVT, drug-related fever).  Evaluation in progress.  Cultures
   submitted.  D/c lines if possible.
   HYPOTENSION -- improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- Resolved.  Biliiary system drained internally.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to medications --> slow clearance.
   Improvement continues, overall.
   CONJUNCTIVAL INJECTION, left -- conjunctivitis, possible contact, but
   concern for infectious conjunctivitis.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Now on insulin drip.  Monitor glucose.  Maintain <150.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Completed CVVHD -->
   hemodialysis to begin tomorrow, if indicated.
   PANCREATITIS -- ACUTE, attributed to galllstone.  s/p ERCP stent
   placement.  Monitor exam, LFTs, amylase, lipase.
   FLUIDS -- hyperexpanded.  Continue net removal.  Aim for 1-2 L/day.
   Monitor I/O.
   A-FIB -- now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium
   channel blocker.
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   BULLOUS LESIONS, Left THIGH --  exam is stable or improving.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal failure and persistent altered mental status. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient experienced transient increased dyspnea last night and required increased inspiratory pressure settings. He is more awake today and able to move his fingers, toes, and legs. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/102 mmHg to 148/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and blood glucose levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure - attributed to sepsis, altered mental status, volume resuscitation. The underlying cause is asthma. The patient is showing good progress overall, but there is evidence of a new right lower lobe infiltrate, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Plan to initiate empirical antimicrobials directed towards VAP pathogens. Continue moving towards extubation trial as mental status improves.
2. Fever - recurrent. It could be due to underlying pancreatitis. However, it is necessary to monitor for signs of complications related to pancreatitis (pseudocyst, hemorrhage) or new infections"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure currently on CVVH.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   - Patient with increased vent requirement today, despite being more
   alert with improved neurological exam.  As a consequence, he is not
   ready for extubation at this point.  Coupled with fevers and
   radiographic evidence of increased opacity on CXR, may represent VAP.
   - Start empiric treatment for VAP as below, assess for VAP or other
   acute pulmonary process with non-contrast chest CT, mini-BAL
   - Decrease PS as tolerated
   .
    # Fevers:   Pt with low grade temps up to 100.6F axillary despite
   being on CVVH.  Etiology is unclear, but may represent acute pulmonary
   process (VAP), line infection, or could be be [**1-16**] inflammation from
   necrotic pancreas.  The patient has been off all Abx for the past 2d.
   Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no other source of
   infection but no abscess formation.  Howver, LFTs have been trending
   up.  The patient continued to be hemodynamically stable off pressors.
   - F/u BCx, HD line culture, A-line cath VAP
   - Start the pt. on empiric treatment for VAP with Vanc, Zosyn and Cipro
   -If no obvious lung process is identified on CT, will replace lines and
   give pt. line holiday.
   - consider repeat CT abdomen  if LFTs continue to trend up
   - Appreciate continued ID recs
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Likely due to poorly functioning pancreas given
   necrosis and markedly stenotic splenic vein.  Marked hyperglycemia this
   AM, the patient started on IV Insulin and increased dose of Lantus.
   Expected to be hyperglycemic, as was previously getting 160 units of
   Lantus with TPN.
   - Will uptitrate as needed to keep BGs under 200.  Will monitor IV
   insulin requirements today and adjust Lantus dose accordingly.
   # Skin:  some bullous lesions on L anterior/superior thigh where tape
   was previously placed.  Erythematous blanching rash on L flank, RLE,
   RUE.  Per derm, likely stasis dermatitis.  Less likely drug rash
   without maculopapular pattern and no eosinophilia.  Originally concern
   for fungemia/underlying infection with skin manifestation, but CT
   negative, B-glucan negative.  Derm declined to biopsy.
   - exam is stable/improving
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN. CVVH stopped this AM after 72
   hours.  Per renal recs, will start HD tomorrow
   - appreciate continued renal recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  LFTs
   trended up mildly this AM. Alk phos  and TBili still elevated but
   stable, likely secondary to cholestasis.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes daily
   - Will perform CT abdomen if LFTs continue to trend up.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm w rate in 90s.  Reached
   loading dose on [**10-6**], so amio gtt was DCed, but loading dose should
   stay in his system for a while.
   - cont to monitor and may start home calcium channel blocker
   - continue Metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # Anemia: Will need to cont to monitor, stable for now with no signs of
   active bleed
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been febrile, with temperatures up to 100.6°F, and has shown signs of improved neurological status but still requires intubation. There are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and line infections, and the patient's LFTs have been trending up. His hyperglycemia is likely due to poorly functioning pancreas, and he is being treated with insulin. The patient also has skin lesions, possibly stasis dermatitis, and acute renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN), for which CVVH has been stopped and hemodialysis (HD) will be started tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increased vent requirement, radiographic evidence of increased opacity on CXR, and fever suggest the possibility of VAP. Empiric treatment for VAP has been started, and a non-contrast chest CT will be performed to assess for VAP or other acute pulmonary processes.

2. Line infections: The patient's fevers and elevated LFTs may indicate a line infection. Blood cultures from the HD line and A-line catheter will be monitored to identify"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   - Patient with has been stable on the vent with increased PEEP.  CT
   scan from yesterday suggestive of VAP, which likely may have
   contributed to increased vent requirements from the day before.
   - Continue empiric treatment for VAP as below, assess for VAP or other
   acute pulmonary process with non-contrast chest CT, mini-BAL
   - Decrease PEEP today and see how the patient tolerates it.
   -If tolerates well, may consider extubation
   .
    # Fevers:   Pt with low grade temps up to 100.9F today.  Based on CT
   chest, likely to be secondary  to  acute pulmonary process (VAP), but
   may also represent line infection, or could be be [**1-16**] inflammation from
   necrotic pancreas.   Recent CT showed necrotic pancreas but with no
   other source of infection but no abscess formation.  LFTs trending down
   today.  The patient continued to be hemodynamically stable off
   pressors.
   - F/u BCx, HD line culture, A-line cath VAP
   - Continue the pt. on empiric treatment for VAP with Vanc, Zosyn and
   Cipro
   -Continue to trend LFTs
   - Appreciate continued ID recs
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Likely due to poorly functioning pancreas given
   necrosis and markedly stenotic splenic vein.  Blood glucose values have
   been slowly improving currently on increased dose of IV Lantus.
   - Will uptitrate as needed to keep BGs under 200.  Will monitor IV
   insulin requirements today and adjust Lantus dose accordingly.
   # Acute renal failure:  likely ATN.  The plan is for pt. to start HD
   today per renal
   - appreciate continued renal recs
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CBD stent placed by ERCP fellow.  LFTs , ALk
   Phos and Bilirubin slowly trending down today.
   - Trend LFTs and pancreatic enzymes daily
   - Will perform CT abdomen if LFTs continue to trend up.
   -Discuss splenic vein thrombosis with Gen surgery
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm w rate in 90s.  Reached
   loading dose on [**10-6**], so amio gtt was DCed, but loading dose should
   stay in his system for a while.
   - cont to monitor and may start home calcium channel blocker
   - continue Metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # Anemia: Will need to cont to monitor, stable for now with no signs of
   active bleed
   - Active type and screen.
   - Transfuse if Hct < 25

   Disposition :ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension and asthma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has been improving over the past 24 hours with better neurological exam and mental status. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been stable on the ventilator with increased PEEP, and a CT scan from yesterday suggested VAP. There is a need to continue empiric treatment for VAP and assess for VAP or other acute pulmonary processes with a non-contrast chest CT and mini-BAL. Decreasing PEEP today and considering extubation if tolerated are also recommended.

2. Fevers: The patient has had low-grade temperatures up to 100.9F today. This may be secondary to an acute pulmonary process (VAP), but could also represent a line infection or inflammation from necrotic pancreas. Further investigation is needed, including blood cultures, HD line culture, and A-line cath VAP. Empiric treatment for VAP with Vanc, Zosyn, and Cipro should be continued.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose values have been slowly improving, likely due to a poorly functioning pancreas given necrosis and stenotic splenic vein. Increasing the"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yom gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal
   failure and persistent altered mental status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis, altered mental status,
   volume resussitation.  Underlying asthma.  Good progress overall, but
   now with evidence for new RLL infiltate (probale VAP).  Plan initiate
   empirical antimictobials directed to VAP pathogens.   Continue to move
   towards extubation trial as mental status improves.
   RLL PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- VAP, continue antibiotics.
   FEVER -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to underlying pancreatitis.  However,
   need to continue monitor for signs of complication of pancreatitis
   (pseudocyst, hemorrhage) or new infection (VAP, line-related infection,
   urine source, C. diff, hepatobilliary infection), or non-infectious
   causes (DVT, drug-related fever).  Evaluation in progress.  Cultures
   submitted.  D/c lines if possible.
   HYPOTENSION -- improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE
 RLL; concern for evolving VAP
 empirical
   treatment for VAP, pending evaluation.
   SEPSIS -- Resolved.  Biliiary system drained internally.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to medications --> slow clearance.
   Improvement continues, overall.
   CONJUNCTIVAL INJECTION, left -- conjunctivitis, possible contact, but
   concern for infectious conjunctivitis.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Now on insulin drip.  Monitor glucose.  Maintain <150.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Completed CVVHD yesterday,
   limited urine output --> hemodialysis to begin today.
   PANCREATITIS -- ACUTE, attributed to galllstone.  s/p ERCP stent
   placement.  Monitor exam, LFTs, amylase, lipase.  CT demonstrates early
   formation of pseudocyst.
   FLUIDS -- hyperexpanded.  Continue net removal.  Aim for 1-2 L/day.
   Monitor I/O.
   A-FIB -- now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium
   channel blocker.
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   BULLOUS LESIONS, Left THIGH --  exam is stable or improving.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old individual with a history of gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has shown some improvement in their mental status, with increased wakefulness. However, they are still not fully oriented. The patient has a history of underlying asthma and is now presenting with evidence of a right lower lobe pulmonary infiltrate, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure with elevated serum creatinine levels and low urine output. They also have hyperglycemia, with a blood glucose level of 300 mg/dL. Other lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 281 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, bilateral lower extremity edema, warm and dry skin, and normal neurologic examination findings.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure currently on HD.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   Patient vent requirement today at PS 10 and PEEP 8, more alert with
   improved neurological exam.  However due to his persistent weakness, he
   is not ready for extubation at this point.  Fevers and radiographic
   evidence of increased opacity on CXR and CT may represent VAP. Will
   wean PS and PEEP today as tolerated.
   #VAP:
   CT showed consolidations in the LLL, RML, and RLL.  Patient was started
   on Vancomycin, Cipro, and Zosyn [**2169-10-11**] for VAP coverage. Continue to
   monitor ventillator requirements. Monitor fevers. Dose vanc by levels.
   Give 1gm today after HD.
   #Hyperglycemia:
   Pt had episode of hypoglycemia overnight in the setting of high insulin
   drip dose.  His drip requirement has decreased and his AM glargine was
   increased to 50 units.  Continue titrating drip and continue with 50
   units glargine qAM.
   #ARF:
   BUN/Creatinine bumped today in the setting of no CVVH.  BUN/Cr 64/4.3
   today.  Scheduled for HD today.  Follow-up renal recs.
   #Gallstone pancreatitis:
   S/P stent placement.  Amylase and lipase WNL.  Transaminases trending
   down. Continue to trend LFTs.  CT showed possible early pseudocyst
   formation.  Will need follow-up for potential pseudocyst.
   #A-Fib:
   Now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium channel
   blocker.
   #Anemia:
   Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   #Bullous lesions, Left thigh:
   Exam is stable or improving

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was transferred to the hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on hemodialysis (HD). The patient's recent progress includes improved neurological exam and alertness, but persistent weakness. He requires ventilation support due to hypoxic respiratory failure and has shown evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and his insulin drip dose was adjusted. His BUN/Creatinine levels indicate ongoing acute renal failure, and he is scheduled for HD today. There are also findings of a possible early pseudocyst formation related to his gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's atrial fibrillation has resolved, and he may need to start a home calcium channel blocker. He has stable anemia, and his bullous lesions on the left thigh are stable or improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's CT scan shows consolidations in the left lower lobe (LLL), right middle lobe (RML), and right lower lobe (RLL), suggesting VAP. He has been started on Vancomycin, Cipro, and Zosyn for coverage. Monitoring of ventilator requirements and fevers is important.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yom gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal
   failure and persistent altered mental status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis, altered mental status,
   volume resussitation.  Underlying asthma.  Good progress overall, but
   now with evidence for new RLL infiltate (probale VAP).  Plan initiate
   empirical antimictobials directed to VAP pathogens.   Continue to move
   towards extubation trial as mental status improves.
   RLL PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- VAP, continue antibiotics.
   FEVER -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to underlying pancreatitis.  However,
   need to continue monitor for signs of complication of pancreatitis
   (pseudocyst, hemorrhage) or new infection (VAP, line-related infection,
   urine source, C. diff, hepatobilliary infection), or non-infectious
   causes (DVT, drug-related fever).  Evaluation in progress.  Cultures
   submitted.  D/c lines if possible.
   HYPOTENSION -- improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE
 RLL --> VAP, now on empirical treatment for VAP.
   SEPSIS -- Resolved.  Biliiary system drained internally.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to medications --> slow clearance.
   Improvement continues, overall.
   CONJUNCTIVAL INJECTION, left -- conjunctivitis, possible contact,
   improved.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Now on insulin drip.  Monitor glucose.  Maintain <150.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Completed CVVHD yesterday,
   limited urine output --> hemodialysis to begin today.
   PANCREATITIS -- ACUTE, attributed to galllstone.  s/p ERCP stent
   placement.  Monitor exam, LFTs, amylase, lipase.  CT demonstrates early
   formation of pseudocyst.
   FLUIDS -- approaching baseline.  Continue net removal.  Aim for [**12-16**]
   L/dialysis.  Monitor I/O.
   A-FIB -- now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium
   channel blocker.
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   BULLOUS LESIONS, Left THIGH --  exam is stable or improving.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), a heart rate of 85 bpm, a blood pressure of 109/45 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and creatinine levels, as well as low platelet count. 

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including respiratory failure attributed to sepsis, altered mental status, volume resuscitation, underlying asthma, and right lower lobe pulmonary infiltrate (probable ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP). The patient also has a fever, hypotension, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, pancreatitis, conjunctival injection, and anemia. 

The patient's physical examination reveals trace edema in the lower extremities and warm skin without rash or jaundice. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and remains generally weak but slowly improving. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to sepsis, altered mental status, volume resuscitation, and underlying asthma. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yom gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal
   failure and persistent altered mental status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis, altered mental status,
   volume resussitation.  Underlying asthma.  Good progress overall, but
   now with evidence for new RLL infiltate (probale VAP).  Plan initiate
   empirical antimictobials directed to VAP pathogens.   Continue to move
   towards extubation trial as mental status improves.
   RLL PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- VAP, continue antibiotics.
   FEVER -- recurrent.  Attributed to VAP, and may be due in part to
   underlying pancreatitis.  However, need to continue monitor for signs
   of complication of pancreatitis (pseudocyst, hemorrhage) or new
   infection (line-related infection, urine source, C. diff,
   hepatobilliary infection), or non-infectious causes (DVT, drug-related
   fever).  Evaluation in progress.  Cultures submitted.  D/c lines if
   possible.
   HYPOTENSION -- improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE
 RLL --> VAP, now on empirical treatment for VAP.
   SEPSIS -- Resolved.  Biliiary system drained internally.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to medications --> slow clearance.
   Improvement continues, overall.
   CONJUNCTIVAL INJECTION, left -- conjunctivitis, possible contact,
   improved.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Now on insulin drip.  Monitor glucose.  Maintain <150.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Completed CVVHD, and
   tolerated hemodialysis yesterday.  Continue per 3x/week.
   PANCREATITIS -- ACUTE, attributed to galllstone.  s/p ERCP stent
   placement.  Monitor exam, LFTs, amylase, lipase.  CT demonstrates early
   formation of pseudocyst.
   FLUIDS -- approaching baseline.  Continue net removal.  Aim for [**12-16**]
   L/dialysis.  Monitor I/O.
   A-FIB -- now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium
   channel blocker.
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   BULLOUS LESIONS, Left THIGH --  exam is stable or improving.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal failure and persistent altered mental status. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. He is gradually awakening and attempting to move his arms and legs. Tolerated hemodialysis yesterday.

The patient has been on various antibiotics since October 12nd, including Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). He is currently being treated for a right lower lobe pulmonary infiltrate, suspected to be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures have been submitted, and antibiotics have been initiated empirically.

The patient also has a fever, which is attributed to VAP and may be related to underlying pancreatitis. However, it is important to monitor for signs of complications such as pseudocyst or hemorrhage related to pancreatitis, or new infections like line-related infection, urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile, or hepatobiliary infection. Non-infectious causes such as deep vein thrombosis or drug-related fever should also be considered. Evaluation is ongoing, and cultures have been submitted.

The patient's blood pressure has improved, but close monitoring is necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient's altered mental status is attributed to medications with slow clearance. Improvement continues overall.

Other notable findings include conjunctival injection, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yom gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis, complicated by acute renal
   failure and persistent altered mental status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to sepsis, altered mental status,
   volume resussitation.  Underlying asthma.  Good progress overall, but
   now with evidence for new RLL infiltate (probale VAP).  Plan initiate
   empirical antimictobials directed to VAP pathogens.   Continue to move
   towards extubation trial as mental status improves.
   RLL PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- VAP, continue antibiotics.
   FEVER -- recurrent.  Attributed to VAP, and may be due in part to
   underlying pancreatitis.  However, need to continue monitor for signs
   of complication of pancreatitis (pseudocyst, hemorrhage) or new
   infection (line-related infection, urine source, C. diff,
   hepatobilliary infection), or non-infectious causes (DVT, drug-related
   fever).  Evaluation in progress.  Cultures submitted.  D/c lines if
   possible.
   HYPOTENSION -- improved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE
 RLL --> VAP, now on empirical treatment for VAP.
   SEPSIS -- Resolved.  Biliiary system drained internally.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to medications --> slow clearance.
   Improvement continues, overall.
   CONJUNCTIVAL INJECTION, left -- conjunctivitis, possible contact,
   improved.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Now on insulin drip.  Monitor glucose.  Maintain <150.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN.  Completed CVVHD, and
   tolerated hemodialysis yesterday.  Continue per 3x/week.
   PANCREATITIS -- ACUTE, attributed to galllstone.  s/p ERCP stent
   placement.  Monitor exam, LFTs, amylase, lipase.  CT demonstrates early
   formation of pseudocyst.
   FLUIDS -- approaching baseline.  Continue net removal.  Aim for [**12-16**]
   L/dialysis.  Monitor I/O.
   A-FIB -- now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium
   channel blocker.
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   BULLOUS LESIONS, Left THIGH --  exam is stable or improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and persistent altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by a right lower lobe pulmonary infiltrate, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and he is now on empirical antimicrobials for VAP. The patient's fever is recurrent and may be attributed to VAP or underlying pancreatitis. Other potential sources of infection should also be monitored, including line-related infection, urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile, or hepatobiliary infection. Hypotension has improved but should continue to be monitored, maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg. The patient's altered mental status is improving slowly, likely due to medication clearance. The patient's blood glucose levels are being managed with an insulin drip, aiming to maintain levels below 150 mg/dL. Acute renal failure has been attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and the patient has completed continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and tolerated hemodialysis yesterday. Renal function will continue to be monitored with peritoneal dialysis three times a week. The patient had acute pancreatitis secondary to gallstones and has undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) stent placement."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure currently on HD.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   Patient vent requirement overnight was at PS 5 and PEEP 5, now at 5/0.
   More alert with improved neurological exam.  He is ready for extubation
   at this point.
   - Extubate
   #VAP:
   CT showed consolidations in the LLL, RML, and RLL.  Patient was started
   on Vancomycin, Cipro, and Zosyn [**2169-10-11**] for VAP coverage. Continue to
   monitor ventillator requirements. Afebrile since [**73**]:00 on [**10-12**].
   Monitor fevers. Dose vanc by levels.  Given 500mg yesterday after HD.
   Continue coverage now, and move toward peering back on coverage over
   the weekend if cultures are negative.
   #Hyperglycemia:
   Pt's BG this AM was 69 on chemistry. His drip requirement has decreased
   and is currently off. His AM glargine was increased to 50 units.
   Continue with 50 units glargine qAM and monitor BG.
   #ARF:
   BUN/Creatinine increased today in the presence of HD yesterday.  BUN/Cr
   71/5.0 today.  Follow-up renal recs for HD schedule.  Likely to be a
   long term HD patient.
   #Gallstone pancreatitis:
   S/P stent placement.  Amylase and lipase WNL.  Transaminases trending
   down (AST 31). Continue to trend LFTs.  CT showed possible early
   pseudocyst formation.  Will need follow-up for potential pseudocyst.
   Surgery has been re-consulted - most immediate concern is bleeding into
   the pancreas.  Will recheck a HCT to trend the level.
   #A-Fib:
   Now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium channel
   blocker.
   #Anemia:
   Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   #Bullous lesions, Left thigh:
   Lesions have resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was transferred from another hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, leading to septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguric acute renal failure. He is currently on hemodialysis. The patient's condition has shown improvement with improved neurological exam and decreased ventilator requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced hypoxic respiratory failure and is now ready for extubation. However, there is a risk of reintubation if the trial of extubation fails.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has consolidations on CT scan, indicating possible VAP. He is currently being treated with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cipro, and Zosyn). Monitoring his respiratory status and continued coverage of antibiotics are important.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient had an elevated blood glucose level but is currently controlled with glargine insulin. Monitoring his blood glucose levels is essential.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's BUN/Creatinine levels increased after hemodialysis, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. Follow-up renal recommendations for the hemodialysis schedule are necessary, as he is likely to be a long-term hemodialysis patient.
5. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient had gallstone pancreatitis, which required stent placement. Amylase"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure currently on HD.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   Patient vent requirement overnight was at PS 5 and PEEP 5, now at 5/0.
   More alert with improved neurological exam.  He is ready for extubation
   at this point.
   - Extubate
   #VAP:
   CT showed consolidations in the LLL, RML, and RLL.  Patient was started
   on Vancomycin, Cipro, and Zosyn [**2169-10-11**] for VAP coverage. Continue to
   monitor ventillator requirements. Afebrile since [**73**]:00 on [**10-12**].
   Monitor fevers. Dose vanc by levels.  Given 500mg yesterday after HD.
   Continue coverage now, and move toward peering back on coverage over
   the weekend if cultures are negative.
   #Hyperglycemia:
   Pt's BG this AM was 69 on chemistry. His drip requirement has decreased
   and is currently off. His AM glargine was increased to 50 units.
   Continue with 50 units glargine qAM and monitor BG.
   #ARF:
   BUN/Creatinine increased today in the presence of HD yesterday.  BUN/Cr
   71/5.0 today.  Follow-up renal recs for HD schedule.  Likely to be a
   long term HD patient.
   #Gallstone pancreatitis:
   S/P stent placement.  Amylase and lipase WNL.  Transaminases trending
   down (AST 31). Continue to trend LFTs.  CT showed possible early
   pseudocyst formation.  Will need follow-up for potential pseudocyst.
   Surgery has been re-consulted - most immediate concern is bleeding into
   the pancreas.  Will recheck a HCT to trend the level.
   #A-Fib:
   Now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium channel
   blocker.
   #Anemia:
   Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   #Bullous lesions, Left thigh:
   Lesions have resolved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis that led to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. 

The patient underwent hemodialysis yesterday afternoon, removing 2L of fluid. He has been afebrile since 73:00 on 10-12 and has shown improvement in neurological status, moving both upper and lower extremities in response to commands. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2C (100.7F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/51 to 123/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he is currently extubated.

The patient has right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and diffuse jaundice. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. Other lab results are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: The patient's ventilator requirements have decreased, and he appears ready for extubation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown consolidations on CT scan, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma, who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has been extubated. The patient's recent events include changing glargine from 50 units to 40 units since he is off tube feeds. He received antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has shown improvement in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient had hypoxic respiratory failure due to septic shock. Although he has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure, and his ventilator requirements should be closely monitored.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient developed VAP, for which he received antibiotics. Consolidations were seen on a CT scan, indicating lung infection. Continued monitoring of his respiratory status and potential adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has oliguric acute renal failure, as indicated by increased BUN/Creatinine levels despite hemodialysis. Long-term hemodialysis may be required.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient had elevated blood glucose levels but is currently controlled with insulin therapy. Monitoring of blood glucose levels should continue.
5. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient had gallstone"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital
   for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal
   failure currently on HD.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:
   Patient vent requirement overnight was at PS 5 and PEEP 5, now at 5/0.
   More alert with improved neurological exam.  He is ready for extubation
   at this point.
   - Extubate
   #VAP:
   CT showed consolidations in the LLL, RML, and RLL.  Patient was started
   on Vancomycin, Cipro, and Zosyn [**2169-10-11**] for VAP coverage. Continue to
   monitor ventillator requirements. Afebrile since [**73**]:00 on [**10-12**].
   Monitor fevers. Dose vanc by levels.  Given 500mg yesterday after HD.
   Continue coverage now, and move toward peering back on coverage over
   the weekend if cultures are negative.
   #Hyperglycemia:
   Pt's BG this AM was 69 on chemistry. His drip requirement has decreased
   and is currently off. His AM glargine was increased to 50 units.
   Continue with 50 units glargine qAM and monitor BG.
   #ARF:
   BUN/Creatinine increased today in the presence of HD yesterday.  BUN/Cr
   71/5.0 today.  Follow-up renal recs for HD schedule.  Likely to be a
   long term HD patient.
   #Gallstone pancreatitis:
   S/P stent placement.  Amylase and lipase WNL.  Transaminases trending
   down (AST 31). Continue to trend LFTs.  CT showed possible early
   pseudocyst formation.  Will need follow-up for potential pseudocyst.
   Surgery has been re-consulted - most immediate concern is bleeding into
   the pancreas.  Will recheck a HCT to trend the level.
   #A-Fib:
   Now NSR.  Continue to monitor and may start home calcium channel
   blocker.
   #Anemia:
   Stable.  Continue to monitor Hct.  Transfuse if <21.
   #Bullous lesions, Left thigh:
   Lesions have resolved.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has shown improvement in his neurological exam.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was started on antibiotics for suspected VAP, and the CT scan showed consolidations in the lungs. Monitoring the patient's ventilator requirements and maintaining appropriate coverage for VAP is crucial.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric acute renal failure, and his BUN/Creatinine levels have increased despite HD. It is important to follow up with renal recommendations and consider long-term HD due to the likelihood of being a long-term HD patient.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level was elevated, but it has improved with decreased insulin requirements. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to avoid hyperglycemic complications.

4. Gallstone pancreatitis: Although the patient's amylase and lipase levels are within normal range, there is a possibility of early pseudocyst formation. Follow-up with potential pseudocyst management is recommended.

5. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient had an episode of AFib, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma who was admitted to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently extubated and receiving treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has acute renal failure and is undergoing hemodialysis (HD). His blood glucose levels have been elevated, and insulin therapy has been initiated. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further management plans are in place for potential complications such as bleeding into the pancreas and pseudocyst formation. The patient's atrial fibrillation has resolved, and he may start a home calcium channel blocker. His anemia is stable, and he will be monitored for any significant changes in hemoglobin levels. The bullous lesions on his left thigh have resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding into the pancreas: Surgery has been re-consulted due to the concern of bleeding into the pancreas. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary if this complication occurs.
2. Pseudocyst formation: The patient's CT scan showed possible early pseudocyst formation. Regular follow-up will be needed to monitor for the development of a pseudocyst and determine appropriate management strategies.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP, and continued monitoring of respiratory parameters and response to antibiotic therapy will be essential.

   55 year-old gentleman w/  HTN and asthma transferred from [**Hospital3 33**]
   Hospital for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, now extubated and doing
   well although w/ altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9700**] acute renal failure currently
   on HD.
   1. Altered MS- likely due to combination of high-dose narcotics and
   sedation use over prolonged periods of time; would not attribute this
   to delerium as mental status is not waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**], patient is alert
   and cooperative.
   - patient extubated and doing well, perhaps some component of mental
   status change is possible VAP so  will continue treatment for VAP (as
   CT showed consolidations in the LLL, RML, and RLL) with Vancomycin,
   Cipro, and Zosyn (started [**2169-10-11**]) for 8 day course to end [**10-18**] .
   - dose vanc by levels, will cover for few days and f/u any pending BCx
   - minmize sedating meds, encourage interaction, minimize use of
   restraints although must make sure patient cannot hurt himself
   (probably too weak currently but could become potential problem once pt
   regains strength)

   - patient continues to improve, will consider floor call-out or rehab
   placement in the near future.
   2. Renal insufficiency- BUN/Cr slightly lower than yesterday 5.3 from
   6.7 and had HD yesterday.
   - pulled HD line yesterday, will give line holiday until IR-guided
   placement of tunneled line on Tuesday
   - plan for HD Tuesday
   - started nephrocaps in addition to phos binder
   - appreciate renal recs

   4. Gallstone pancreatitis: much improved, no longer need to trend LFTs,

   Will need follow-up for potential pseudocyst. Surgery has been
   re-consulted - most immediate concern is bleeding into the pancreas.
   Surgery had no further recs at this time.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension and asthma. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis leading to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure. Currently, the patient is extubated and showing improvement in terms of strength, lab data, and neurological function.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is likely due to a combination of high-dose narcotics and prolonged sedation use. This could be attributed to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as there are consolidations seen on the chest CT. The patient will continue treatment for VAP with Vancomycin, Cipro, and Zosyn for an 8-day course until October 18th. Dose adjustments of Vancomycin will be made based on levels, and the use of sedating medications will be minimized.

2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient has renal insufficiency, as indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The patient had hemodialysis (HD) yesterday, and the BUN/Cr levels are slightly lower than the previous day. The plan is to give the HD line holiday until an IR-guided placement of a tunneled line on Tuesday. Nephrocaps will be started in addition to the phosphate binder. Renal recommendations are appreciated.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and asthma.
- He was transferred to the ICU for worsening gallstone pancreatitis, which led to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient is currently extubated and alert, but has altered mental status (MS) due to high-dose narcotics and prolonged sedation.
- He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is responding well.
- The patient has oliguric acute renal failure and is on hemodialysis (HD).
- His blood cultures are negative, and he is expected to recover from gallstone pancreatitis.
- There are concerns about potential complications such as bleeding into the pancreas and pseudocyst formation.
- The patient's current medications include Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Heparin Sodium, and insulin glargine with a sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to high-dose narcotics and prolonged sedation.
2. Pseudocyst formation: The patient's history of gallstone pancreatitis increases the risk of developing a pseudocyst.
3. Bleeding into the pancreas: This is a concern due to the patient's history of pancreatitis.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguric renal failure indicates a risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, pseudocyst, and splenic vein thrombosis. He is currently being treated in the ICU for sepsis, acute renal failure, encephalopathy/delirium, respiratory failure, and probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has shown improvement in his condition but still requires ongoing care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has improved but may still pose a risk if infection persists or recurs.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure, and his urine output has picked up somewhat. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
3. Encephalopathy/Delirium: The patient is experiencing encephalopathy/delirium, which may be residual medication effect or due to other factors. Further evaluation is needed if symptoms do not clear.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient was extubated two days ago but may still be at risk for respiratory failure, especially considering his history of probable VAP.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient's chest x-rays are negative, he will continue receiving antibiotics for an 8-day course as a precautionary measure against VAP.
6. Hoarseness: The patient is experiencing hoarseness, which may be related to intubation."

   Follow expectantly for delirium
   Anticipate that he will need tunnelled line tomorrow or next day, and
   HD on Tuesday.
   He has tolerated extubation.  Urine output is improving, suggesting
   that he may be entering recovery phase from ATN.  He remains
   encephalopathic, likely related to slow clearance of sedative
   medications and his generally ill state.  Today, we will attempt to get
   adequate peripheral IVs.  If able, will discontinue central line.  In
   addition, will discuss with renal about discontinuing temporary
   dialysis line (site looks red and has been in for quite a long time).
   If needs repeat HD, renal
s plan was for tunneled line anyway.  Will
   continue present antibiotics for VAP, but consider de-escalating if
   remains negative for 2-3 days.  As per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 276**]
s note yesterday, he
   is DNR (no CPR), but would be intubated if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with gallstone pancreatitis, pseudocyst, and splenic vein thrombosis. He has also been diagnosed with sepsis, acute renal failure, encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current condition shows improvement, with increased urine output suggesting recovery from acute tubular necrosis (ATN). However, he remains encephalopathic due to slow clearance of sedative medications and his overall ill state. The plan is to attempt peripheral IVs today and potentially discontinue the central line if successful. The temporary dialysis line may be removed and replaced with a tunneled line, as per renal plans. Antibiotics for VAP will be continued but may be de-escalated if the culture remains negative for 2-3 days. The patient has a DNR status but would be intubated if needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is currently on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure. This condition can lead to the accumulation of waste products and toxins in the blood, affecting multiple organ systems.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing encephalopathy, which"
