   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Titrate to FiO2 and PEEP by ABG
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco and pip/tazo for empiric HAP pneumonia given unclear history of
   antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that the patient
   is a hospital SW.  In addition, given suspicion for post-influenza
   pneumonia, S.aureus is also a concern. Will also treat with
   ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR coverage.
   - Tamiflu at 75 mg po bid dosing given renal failure
   - f/u Influenza swab
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - diagnostic paracentesis per liver recs
   - Tamiflu and antimicrobials as above.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate for signs of end organ damage. Vasopressors and
   IVF for volume rescucitation as necessary.
   - Will also do a cosyntropin stimulation test to rule out hepatoadrenal
   syndrome. (results pending this morning)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   - Volume rescucitation as above.
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS.
   - Consult hepatology
   - Patient is not currently on lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 2911**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off
   for now pending hepatology evaluation.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis, although DIC is also a
   potential etiology.  Anemia could also be secondary to bleeding.
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs.
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
   - Trend WBC
   .
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who presented with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days.
- She was transferred from an OSH after experiencing hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
- The patient meets criteria for ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF.
- She is being ventilated with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings and titrated to FiO2 and PEEP by ABG.
- Blood and urine cultures, as well as sputum and BAL cultures, are pending for source of sepsis.
- She is receiving empiric HAP pneumonia coverage with Vanco and pip/tazo, as well as ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR coverage.
- Tamiflu is being administered at 75 mg po bid dosing due to renal failure.
- An influenza swab is also being followed up.
- The patient's severe sepsis includes hypoxia and hypotension, with potential infectious sources such as bacterial pneumonia or influenza.
- A diagnostic paracentesis has been recommended to rule out SBP.
- Vasopressors and IVF are being used for volume resuscitation as necessary.
- A cosyntropin stimulation test will be done to rule out hepatoadrenal syndrome.

   OSH Cultures: GNR in 2 blood cultures.  Can call tomorrow for
   sensitivities.
   All other cultures are negative to date and still pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Titrate to FiO2 and PEEP by ABG
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco and pip/tazo for empiric HAP pneumonia given unclear history of
   antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that the patient
   is a hospital SW.  In addition, given suspicion for post-influenza
   pneumonia, S.aureus is also a concern. Will also treat with
   ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR coverage.
   - Tamiflu at 75 mg po bid dosing given renal failure
   - f/u Influenza swab
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - diagnostic paracentesis per liver recs
   - fluid resuscitation with NS and albumin 50g
   - Tamiflu and antimicrobials as above.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate for signs of end organ damage. Vasopressors and
   IVF for volume rescucitation as necessary.
   - Will also do a cosyntropin stimulation test to rule out hepatoadrenal
   syndrome. (results pending this morning)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.   Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - Volume rescucitation as above.
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS.
   - Consult hepatology
   - Patient is not currently on lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 2911**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off
   for now pending hepatology evaluation.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS.
   - Trend serum sodium
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis, although DIC is also a
   potential etiology.  Anemia could also be secondary to bleeding.
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs.
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
   - Trend WBC

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) after presenting with respiratory distress. She was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation. The patient also had a central IJ placed for pressors and an arterial line for ABG draw and BP monitoring. A bronchoscopy revealed mucus in her bronchi, and she was pan cultured and started on antibiotics for empiric coverage of PNA and abdominal causes. The patient received fluid boluses and was started on pressor support.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. Her last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin at 05:54 PM on 12/28, Ciprofloxacin at 10:00 PM on 12/28, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 06:00 AM on 12/29.

The patient is currently sedated and intubated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.0 C (96.8 F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 97/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has a sinus tachycardia rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, elevated creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count of 49 K/uL. Her liver enzymes are also elevated, with ALT at 82 U/L and AST at 224 U/L. Other labs such as PT/PTT/INR, electrolytes, and albumin are within normal range.

The patient's imaging shows diffuse patchy opacities bilaterally on a chest X-ray, which may represent pulmonary edema or ARDS. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from the left lower lobe showed no microorganisms.

The patient's assessment includes hypoxic respiratory failure, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, liver disease, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy, and leukocytosis. The plan involves ventilating the patient with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings, titrating FiO2 and PEEP by ABG, and following up on sputum, BAL, blood, and urine cultures for the source of sepsis. The patient is also being treated with antibiotics for empiric HAP pneumonia, as well as ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR coverage. Additionally, Tamiflu is being administered for influenza.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis leading to septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, exacerbation of liver disease, development of bleeding due to thrombocyt"

   Patient with acute respiratory failure with CXR suggestive of ARDS. Now
   getting about 8 ml/kg VT (pulling more than vent setting). Will try to
   reduce FIO2 now; O2 sat 97%. Maintain PEEP at present setting for now.
   Patient with urine output < 30 cc hour. Filling pressures are low now,
   considering high PEEP. Would bolus with D5W with 3 amps bicar per liter
   to try to get urine output to 50 cc/hr and avoid worsening metabolic
   acidosis which is driving her respiratory rate and tidal volume and
   making it more difficult to do ARDSnet protocol.
   Continue antibiotics. She is getting double coverage for gram negative
   bacteremia.
   Patient to get albumin given albumin 1.7. Consider lactulose.
   Would add vasopressin and see if we can wean off levophed today as we
   give fluids.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, cirrhosis, pneumonia, and acidosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of encephalopathy.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure with CXR suggestive of ARDS. This condition involves severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs, leading to impaired oxygenation.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is less than 30 cc/hr, indicating acute renal failure. Renal failure can occur due to various reasons, including decreased blood flow to the kidneys, infection, or injury.

3. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, which is a systemic response to infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.

4. Acidosis: The patient is experiencing metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by an imbalance in the body's pH level due to excess acids. Acidosis can be a result of inadequate oxygenation, kidney dysfunction, or infection.

5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, indicating anemia. Anemia can contribute to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.

6. Cirrhosis: The"

   [**12-29**]:
   - goal urine output 50cc/hour
   - 25 albumin  --> did she get it?
   - D5W with 3A bicarb @150cc/hour  --> for 2L
   - started lactulose, rifaximin, vasopressin
   - abdominal u/s: Moderate amount of ascites, with the largest pocket in
   the right lower quadrant.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test -->  failed [**Last Name (un) **] stim, started on Hydrocortisone
   - Hep recs: give alb 25g, Abd us to eval for ascites. Elevated Tbili
   likely due to infxn. Would give additional 25g albumin (done), f/u
   blood and urine cx's, continue hold Lasix and Aldactone, get abd u/s
   (done). Attndg recs get an echo for 2/6 systolic murmur (not ordered)
   - Started on TF's but had high residuals so stopped
   - Pt breath stacking? Has small double-digit Tv's and then subsequent
   large Tv breaths. Increased sedation modestly (now at Versed 6). Went
   up on PEEP (to 15) with goal to go down on Fi02 (currently 80%, haven't
   weaned).
   - 1015pm 7.31/46/74/24
   - Discuss doing a para on her --> only small ascites on u/s though
   - Maintaining UOP ~50/hr, CVP 8, so bolused 500cc D5W with HCO3
   [**12-30**]

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Try to wean down PEEP first this am, now that pt is oxygenating
   better. Try to get her back down to 15, then down on FiO2, as
   tolerated.
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, can consider stopping Tamiflu, but she is
   still quite ill
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso)
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN

   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses, as pt
   now hyponatremic with 2L D5W yesterday

   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising

   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever. She has been experiencing hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, liver disease, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy, leukocytosis, and hyperglycemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient currently meets criteria for ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Ventilation with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings has been initiated. The goal is to wean down PEEP first and then decrease FiO2 as tolerated.
2. Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension are concerning for an infectious process. Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or influenza. Empirical antibiotic coverage has been started.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a concern for pre-renal azotemia, ATN, or HRS. Fluid management and close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels are important.
4. Liver disease: The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis with acute decompensation. Rising liver function tests and low albumin levels indicate worsening"

   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2159-12-29**] 12:00 PM
   abdominal
   [**12-29**]:
   - goal urine output 50cc/hour
   - 25 albumin  --> did she get it?
   - D5W with 3A bicarb @150cc/hour  --> for 2L
   - started lactulose, rifaximin, vasopressin
   - abdominal u/s: Moderate amount of ascites, with the largest pocket in
   the right lower quadrant.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test -->  failed [**Last Name (un) **] stim, started on Hydrocortisone
   - Hep recs: give alb 25g, Abd us to eval for ascites. Elevated Tbili
   likely due to infxn. Would give additional 25g albumin (done), f/u
   blood and urine cx's, continue hold Lasix and Aldactone, get abd u/s
   (done). Attndg recs get an echo for 2/6 systolic murmur (not ordered)
   - Started on TF's but had high residuals so stopped
   - Pt breath stacking? Has small double-digit Tv's and then subsequent
   large Tv breaths. Increased sedation modestly (now at Versed 6). Went
   up on PEEP (to 15) with goal to go down on Fi02 (currently 80%, haven't
   weaned).
   - 1015pm 7.31/46/74/24
   - Discuss doing a para on her --> only small ascites on u/s though
   - Maintaining UOP ~50/hr, CVP 8, so bolused 500cc D5W with HCO3
   [**12-30**]

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Will try to wean her down of FiO2 first today
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, will stop Tamiflu
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - will get bladder pressure today to evaluate for intra-abdominal
   pressure
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct this pm
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
   - Trend WBC
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Repeat fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if
   persistently elevated.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis presenting with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days. She has been transferred from an OSH and is currently in the ICU. Her condition is concerning for an influenza type picture or a post-influenza bacterial pneumonia. She meets criteria for ARDS and severe sepsis. The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypotension and inadequate perfusion. She also has hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, leukocytosis, and hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, and sore throat, along with the presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray, suggest a possible infectious etiology such as influenza or bacterial pneumonia. If not appropriately managed, this can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potentially result in ARDS.

2. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings indicate severe sepsis. If not promptly and adequately treated, sepsis can progress to septic shock, which can be life-threatening.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which may be secondary to hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion. This can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis, ARDS, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 90/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on multiple infusions including vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormalities in kidney function. The patient is receiving nutritional support through a multi-lumen tube and is being monitored for DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen their current condition.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by impaired gas exchange due to lung injury. Complications may arise if the patient's oxygenation or ventilation status deteriorates.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This increases the risk of further renal damage and potential kidney failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's condition remains critical, requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. Notable lab abnormalities include hyponatremia and elevated lactate levels. The patient's renal function appears to be stabilizing, but electrolyte imbalances and acid-base status require close monitoring. The patient is also receiving hydrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS is a critical condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired oxygenation. Complications may include worsening hypoxemia, respiratory fatigue, and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to impaired urine output and potential accumulation of waste products in the body. Complications may include further deterioration in renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels in the blood, which can lead to various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and cardiovascular collapse. Monitoring serum sodium levels and adjusting fluid administration appropriately is crucial to prevent complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, necessitating the use of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Will try to wean her PEEP today
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, stopped Tamiflu
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - consider diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - will get bladder pressure today to evaluate for intra-abdominal
   pressure
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct this pm
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stop tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Will try to wean her PEEP today
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Influenza is negative, stopped Tamiflu
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - will get bladder pressure today to evaluate for intra-abdominal
   pressure
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Start lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct this pm
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV
   - Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of bleeding.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and she is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, liver disease, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning for influenza or post-influenza bacterial pneumonia, as evidenced by bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray and symptoms of cough, fever, and sore throat. The patient meets criteria for ARDS, which includes a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <100, bilateral infiltrates on imaging, and no evidence of congestive heart failure.

The patient also has signs of severe sepsis, likely secondary to an infectious process. This includes hypoxia, hypotension, leukocytosis, tachypnea, and potential sources of infection such as bacterial pneumonia or influenza. Alternative infectious sources include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or urosepsis.

Acute renal failure is suspected due to inadequate perfusion, resulting in pre-renal azotemia. The patient's urine output is low, and the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and plasma flow index (PFI) suggest pre-renal causes.

The patient's liver disease is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of HCV cirrhosis, PNA, ARDS, and no definitive bug identified but suspected influenza or influenza with superinfection. She has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, and others. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 110/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recent events mentioned. Her physical examination reveals distended abdomen, right and left lower extremity edema, warm skin, and unresponsiveness with no movement or follow commands. Laboratory results show abnormal values including low sodium, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's current assessment includes alteration in nutrition, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and severe sepsis. The plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy, starting reglan for abdominal distension, trying to wean off pressors, addressing hyponatremia, and improving renal function. The patient is critically ill and will remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - consider diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   - Trend blood counts
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stopped tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

The patient is intubated and sedated, with coarse bilateral airway noises. She has pinpoint pupils that are reactive to light. Her abdomen is soft with hypoactive bowel sounds. Extremities show +2 edema, which are warm and well perfused.

Laboratory findings indicate leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels (direct and total), low albumin, prolonged PT/PTT/INR, and elevated D-dimer. Other lab results include elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient has several medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, liver disease, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions that need to be considered:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which include a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 100, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and no evidence of congestive heart failure. The patient is already being ventilated with volume-cycled assist-control (AC) mode at ARDSnet settings.

2. Severe Sepsis: The patient's hypoxia and hypotension are concerning for an infectious process, with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis. Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or influenza. Empirical antibiotic coverage has been initiated.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of pre-renal azotemia, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion. Monitoring urine output (UOP) and serum creatinine levels is ongoing. If necessary, volume resuscitation with normal saline (NS) boluses will be administered.

4. Liver Disease: The patient has chronic HCV cirrhosis with acute decompensation, likely triggered by sepsis and ARDS. Liver function tests (LFTs) are rising, and albumin levels are low. Hepatology recommendations and lactulose therapy will be followed.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely due to hypovolemia in the setting of SIRS. Sodium"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve tomorrow, consider doing esophageal balloon
   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - hold on diuresis this afternoon.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would go with NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT's are rising
   this am, albumin is low
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb
   - Repeat Na this pm
   - Volume resuscitation as above
   - If Na continues to be low, would wean the Vasopressin before the
   Levophed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   - Trend blood counts
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   FEN: stopped tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,

   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU after presenting with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever. The patient's symptoms are concerning for either influenza or a post-influenza bacterial pneumonia. She currently meets criteria for ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less likely in the setting of a viral prodrome.

The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. She has been ventilated with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings. PEEP has been weaned to 8 and then back to 10 due to low O2. FiO2 is being attempted to be weaned to 40% and PEEP to 8 again. If the patient does not improve tomorrow, an esophageal balloon may be evaluated to assess a good PEEP for her.

Sputum, BAL, blood, and urine cultures have been ordered for the source of sepsis. The patient is receiving Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically. She is also being kept in reverse Trendelenburg position, and albuterol/ipratropium is being administered as needed. Diuresis has been held for the afternoon.

The patient also presents with severe se"

   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean FiO2 to 40% and PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn

   tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg

   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - consider tapping her ascites seen on abd u/s
   - if she doesn't improve would consider further imaging (CT torso) but
   not thought to be high yield
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP and lactate through the day --> UOP meeting goal of 50cc/hr
   this morning
   - Has started Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   - Continue pressors and try to wean Levo first, then Vasopressin,
   however if she continues to be hypoNa then would stop ADH first

   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr.  Our goal of UOP is 50cc/hour

   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   - Trend blood counts
   - DIC and hemolysis labs --> add on fractionation of Tbili to this am's
   labs
   - Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood

   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received today. Ordered
   for qid fingersticks, but no insulin.
   - Rept fingerstick and would consider starting insulin if persistently
   elevated.

   FEN: stopped tube feeds, replete as necessary, IVF as above.

   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 51-year-old woman with cirrhosis and PNA/ARDS. She is currently not waking up despite stopping sedation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 117/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 330 mL, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 186, and HCO3- of 31 mEq/L. 

The patient has a history of cirrhosis, alteration in nutrition, hyponatremia, ARDS, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis. She is also experiencing respiratory failure, fluid overload, and musculoskeletal pain. Her renal function is improving with good urine output. 

The plan includes weaning off PEEP and FiO2, giving Lasix to address fluid overload, holding medications that may contribute to her condition, starting lactulose for encephalopathy, and continuing to monitor her coagulopathy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, worsening of renal function, development of"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon tomorrow to
   evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - hold on diuresis; goal even to negative.
   - for alkalemia:
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr improved today.
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr
   - If volume resuscitation needed today would try NS boluses
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated. Three point Hct drop over yesterday,
   and INR rising through yesterday.
   - Hct, plt, coags stable today
   - folate and B12 for elevated MCV when tolerating tube feeds
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.
   -Resolved
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb.
   - resolved, hypernatremic today
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary, IVF as above.

If there is no improvement, consideration will be given to performing an esophageal balloon tomorrow to evaluate a good PEEP for her.

Sputum, BAL, blood, and urine cultures have been ordered to identify the source of sepsis. Antibiotics have been started empirically with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.
   - Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - PEEP weaned to 8 and now back to 10 because of low O2.  Will attempt
   to wean PEEP to 8 again.
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon tomorrow to
   evaluate a good PEEP for her
   - f/u Sputum, BAL, blood and urine cultures for source of sepsis
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - diurese with goal -500cc to -1L today; give 20IV lasix now
   - f/u SpO2 on ABG to correlate with SpO2 given PaO2 should be given
   higher SpO2 than we are seeing on the monitor
   - monitor mental status, as now off sedation, and need more alert for
   extubation
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - ABx as above
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr improved today.
   - Continue to follow UOP and Cr
   - Renally dose all meds for new improved Cr
   - Lasix for diuresis today, as above
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12).
   - Hct, plt, coags stable today
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.
   -Resolved
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then
   got 2L D5W with bicarb.
   - resolved, hypernatremic today
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary, hold IVF today as diuresis goal.
   PPx: Pneumoboots, Pepcid (hold heparin SQ due to thrombocytopenia and
   elevated INR).

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis, and acute renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and nutrition support. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 133/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on an endotracheal tube with ventilator support. Her central venous pressure is 1 mmHg, indicating low fluid volume. 

The patient's lab results show low sodium levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal kidney function tests. Her platelet count is within normal range, but her white blood cell count is slightly elevated. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in electrolyte levels and liver function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, edema in both lower extremities, clear breath sounds, and altered mental status with poor responsiveness.

The patient's medical complications include cirrhosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypotension, and sepsis. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory function, further deterioration of renal function, development of hepatic encephalopathy, and worsening coagulopathy.

It is important to closely monitor"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - RUQ US and diagnostic paracentesis, per liver, to r/o SBP vs
   intra-abdominal process such as cholangitis
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 2) for HAP.
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Attempt extubation later today.  Patient became agitated during SBP
   with sinus tachycardia to 130
s and hypertension to 180
s systolic.
   Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and propofol.  Attempt another
   attempt to rapidly wean later today to minimize time off sedation.
   Difficulty weaning from vent believed to be [**3-5**] encephalopathy vs.
   altered mental status [**3-5**] sedation.
   - Wean Propofol as tolerated using Zyprexa 5mg standing and prn Zyprexa
   as needed
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon to evaluate
   a good PEEP for her
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - f/u SpO2 on ABG to correlate with SpO2 given PaO2 should be given
   higher SpO2 than we are seeing on the monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr normalized but elevated today [**1-4**] with hypernatremia, likely
   pre-renal.
   - Increase free water intake; increase free water flushes, D5W IVF 1L
   for now, slowly replete throughout the day
   - PM lytes
   - Consider urine lytes tomorrow if renal failure worsens with increased
   free water
   - Meds were renally dosed [**1-3**] for improved Cr
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Hyponatremia: Initialy hyponatremia likely due to
   hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then got 2L D5W with bicarb with
   resolution.  Now hypernatremic with elevated Cr.
   - D5W IVF for slow fluid repletion
   - Increase free water flushes
   - Albumin to decrease third spacing of fluids
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12), likely [**3-5**]
   liver failure.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.  Resolved.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary.
   PPx: Pneumoboots, Pepcid (hold heparin SQ due to thrombocytopenia and
   elevated INR).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who presented with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days. The patient has been hospitalized and has a complicated hospital course characterized by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine, hypoxia, and an influenza-like picture. The patient's overall condition is concerning for an infectious process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis, potentially due to bacterial pneumonia or influenza. Other potential infectious sources include SBP or urosepsis.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, as evidenced by bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 100, and no evidence of congestive heart failure. The patient was initially ventilated with volume-cycled assist-control (AC) at ARDSnet settings.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with acute renal failure likely secondary to inadequate perfusion. The patient has hypernatremia and elevated creatinine levels, suggesting pre-renal azotemia.

The patient also has liver disease, with a MELD score of 29 and HCV cirrhosis experiencing acute decompensation. The patient's liver function tests are stably elevated.

Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy are present in the patient, which could be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis or portal hypertension with splenic seque"

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 2) for HAP.
   - Add fluconazole for fungal coverage.
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Attempt extubation later today.  Patient became agitated during SBP
   with sinus tachycardia to 130
s and hypertension to 180
s systolic.
   Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and propofol.  Attempt another
   attempt to rapidly wean later today to minimize time off sedation.
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon to evaluate
   a good PEEP for her
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Add fluconazole as above
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - f/u SpO2 on ABG to correlate with SpO2 given PaO2 should be given
   higher SpO2 than we are seeing on the monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr normalized but elevated today [**1-4**] with hypernatremia, likely
   pre-renal.
   - NS IVF; 1L for now, slowly replete throughout the day
   - PM lytes
   - Consider urine lytes
   - Meds were renally dosed [**1-3**] for improved Cr
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Hyponatremia: Initialy hyponatremia likely due to
   hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then got 2L D5W with bicarb with
   resolution.  Now hypernatremic with elevated Cr.
   - NS IVF for slow fluid repletion
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12), likely [**3-5**]
   liver failure.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.  Resolved.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary.
   PPx: Pneumoboots, Pepcid (hold heparin SQ due to thrombocytopenia and
   elevated INR).

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever. She has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, liver disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, and hyperglycemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:
1. Infection: The patient has severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. The presence of fever, cough, and positive yeast growth in BAL cultures indicate a possible fungal infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure has progressed to ARDS, a serious lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. It is characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which is a sudden episode of kidney dysfunction or failure. It can be caused by various factors, including dehydration, sepsis, and low blood flow to the kidneys.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's HCV cirrhosis has led to acute decompensation, resulting in liver failure. This condition can cause"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, PNA/ARDS, who became hypertensive, tachycardic, and agitated overnight. She was given boluses of versed/fentanyl, but attempts at spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) were unsuccessful due to her remaining hypertensive and tachycardic. 

The patient has a fever of 101.9°F and received antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She is currently on propofol infusion, fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), famotidine (Pepcid), lactulose, rifaximin, chlorhexidine, hydrocortisone, and SSI. 

Her vital signs show a maximum temperature of 39.1°C (102.4°F) and current temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate (HR) of 97 bpm (94-132 bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 138/72 mmHg to 179/94 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%, and sinus rhythm (SR). 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,581 mL and output of 2,930 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 349 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 330 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 64, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 14 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and compliance of 27.5 cmH2O/mL. 

The patient's blood work reveals a white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.4 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 38 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 34 mmol/L, glucose of 113 mg/dL, and several other abnormal lab results indicating potential organ dysfunction.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 3) for HAP.
   - CXR today to assess difficulty weaning, as well as fevers
   - Send beta glucan and C. diff to work up continued fevers and failure
   to wean
   - f/u RUQ US final read
   - Deferring diagnostic paracentesis for now, as insufficient amount of
   ascites to safely perform procedure
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 weaned
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h [**1-4**], wean to 25mg q12h [**1-5**].
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings. Attempted extubation.  Patient
   became agitated during SBP with sinus tachycardia to 130
s and
   hypertension to 180
s systolic.  Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and
   propofol.  Attempt another attempt to rapidly wean later today to
   minimize time off sedation.  Difficulty weaning from vent believed to
   be [**3-5**] encephalopathy vs. altered mental status [**3-5**] sedation.
   - Transition to PSV today and repeat ABG
   - CXR, beta glucan to w/u possible causes of difficulty weaning from
   vent
   - Per liver, consider bronch to r/o VAP if pt does not improve or
   worsens
   - Per liver, consider fungal coverage if pt does not improve
   - Wean Propofol as tolerated using Zyprexa 5mg standing and prn Zyprexa
   as needed
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon to evaluate
   a good PEEP for her
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Hyponatremia: Initialy hyponatremia likely due to
   hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then got 2L D5W with bicarb with
   resolution.  Now hypernatremic with elevated Cr in setting of 1L
   diarrhea/day and insensible losses [**3-5**] fever.
   - Calculated free water deficit 4.8L.  Administer continuous D5W IVF at
   125cc/hr for fluid repletion
   - Continue free water flushes 250cc q4h
   - Albumin given yesterday to decrease third spacing of fluids
   - Decrease lactulose to 30mg once today, then re-assess
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12), likely [**3-5**]
   liver failure.
   - Repeat Hct; trend today to ensure pt not actively bleeding
   - Ensure active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr normalized but elevated today [**1-4**] with hypernatremia, likely
   pre-renal.  Resolved with increased free water flushes and IVF.
   - Meds were renally dosed [**1-3**] for improved Cr
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.  Resolved.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days. She was transferred from an OSH and her hospital course has been complicated by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall picture is concerning for an influenza-like illness, although she tested negative for DFA, or bacterial PNA, or both. She was found to have two speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in multiple sputum cultures.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode. She is also receiving propofol for sedation, zyprexa for agitation, famotidine (pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and various other medications for sepsis and ARDS. She is being closely monitored for hypernatremia, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, liver disease, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, hypotension, and positive findings on blood cultures, suggest the presence of a severe infection leading to sepsis.
2. ARDS: The patient's history of cough, fever, sore throat, and bilateral infiltrates on"

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10198**] is a 51 year old female with HCV cirrhosis who was
   transferred from an OSH after presenting with cough, HA,
   encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days with a hospital course complicated
   by hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. Her overall
   picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has a
   negative DFA, or a bacterial PNA, or both.  She was found to have two
   speciations of yeast growing in her BAL cultures, as well as in
   multiple sputum cultures.
   .
   # Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for infectious
   process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis given leukocytosis and
   tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources include bacterial pneumonia or
   influenza as above. Alternative infectious sources include SBP or
   urosepsis. Currently off pressors.  Influenza DFA negative.  Sputum and
   BAL positive for two species of yeast.
   - RUQ US and diagnostic paracentesis, per liver, to r/o SBP vs
   intra-abdominal process such as cholangitis
   - f/u pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro (day 2) for HAP.
   - watch UOP
   - Continue Hydrocortisone for poor cortisol stimulation test
 wean
   from 50 q6h to 25 q6h.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating bilateraly
   patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough, fever, and sore
   throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning either for influenza or a
   post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.  She currently meets criteria for
   ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral infiltrates, and no CHF. Other
   potential etiologies include IIPs including AEP and AIP, although less
   likely in setting of viral prodrome.  Initially ventilated with
   volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
   - Attempt extubation later today.  Patient became agitated during SBP
   with sinus tachycardia to 130
s and hypertension to 180
s systolic.
   Placed back on CMV, given Zyprexa and propofol.  Attempt another
   attempt to rapidly wean later today to minimize time off sedation.
   Difficulty weaning from vent believed to be [**3-5**] encephalopathy vs.
   altered mental status [**3-5**] sedation.
   - Wean Propofol as tolerated using Zyprexa 5mg standing and prn Zyprexa
   as needed
   - If she doesn
t improve, consider doing esophageal balloon to evaluate
   a good PEEP for her
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP PNA coverage empirically, given unclear
   history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the fact that
   the patient is a hospital SW.
   - Keep her in reverse Trendelberg
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium prn
   - f/u SpO2 on ABG to correlate with SpO2 given PaO2 should be given
   higher SpO2 than we are seeing on the monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN,
   or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate perfusion.
   FeNa 0.2 and PFI 0.3 so likely prerenal.  No EOS on smear so not likely
   AIN. Cr normalized but elevated today [**1-4**] with hypernatremia, likely
   pre-renal.
   - Increase free water intake; increase free water flushes, D5W IVF 1L
   for now, slowly replete throughout the day
   - PM lytes
   - Consider urine lytes tomorrow if renal failure worsens with increased
   free water
   - Meds were renally dosed [**1-3**] for improved Cr
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Hyponatremia: Initialy hyponatremia likely due to
   hypovolemia in setting of SIRS, and then got 2L D5W with bicarb with
   resolution.  Now hypernatremic with elevated Cr.
   - D5W IVF for slow fluid repletion
   - Increase free water flushes
   - Albumin to decrease third spacing of fluids
   .
   # Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
   decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS. LFT
s stably
   elevated today.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose (now having BM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with thrombocytopenia,
   anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to
   portal hypertension and splenic sequestration, although current
   platelet count worse that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also
   be secondary to worsening HCV cirrhosis. DIC was considered, but labs
   are not consistent with this etiology.   Anemia could also be secondary
   to bleeding. MCV is also elevated (but normal folate, B12), likely [**3-5**]
   liver failure.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Likely due to 2L of D5W she received.  Resolved.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds w/free water flushes (for hypernatremia), replete
   electrolytes as necessary.
   PPx: Pneumoboots, Pepcid (hold heparin SQ due to thrombocytopenia and
   elevated INR).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who was transferred from an outside hospital due to cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days. The patient has been experiencing hypotension requiring peripheral dopamine and hypoxia. The overall picture is concerning for an influenza type picture, although she has negative DFA or bacterial PNA.

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including severe sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, liver disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, and hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Organ dysfunction or failure: Given the patient's severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), there is a risk of organ dysfunction or failure, particularly in the lungs and kidneys.
2. Infection: As the patient is already experiencing sepsis, there is an increased risk of developing further infections, especially with the use of invasive lines and tubes.
3. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if the platelet count continues to decline.
4. Liver decompensation: The patient's liver disease and acute decompensation put her at risk for further deterioration in liver function, which can lead"
