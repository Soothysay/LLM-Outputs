","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of heart disease, hypertension, and malignant hypertension crisis. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypertensive emergency and presented with headache, nausea, and vomiting. Upon arrival in the ICU, he received infusions and other medications. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 175/97 mmHg to 125/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support and has an ABG result of /// 29/. Physical examination findings are not available for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments, and other parameters. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine at 1.3 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.01, and other lab values such as CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 60//0.01, Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 4.8 mg/dL. The patient's condition remains unchanged since admission, except for the noted below. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending further evaluation and management. Potential medical complications that can arise include hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency, heart disease, and malignant hypertension."

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   53 yo W with no significant PMH presents with hypertensive emergency
   and acute pulmonary edema
   .
   # Hypertension:  Some criteria for hypertensive emergency on admission,
   given elevated creatinine and vomiting.  Transitioned from labetalol
   gtt to PO.  Given age and rapid onset of hypertension, secondary causes
   of hypertension investigated including hypothyroidism, renal artery
   stenosis or fibromuscular dysplasia, renal failure, hyperaldosteronism,
   pheochromocytoma. No renal artery bruits on exam and no hypothyroid
   symptoms on ROS. Did report diaphoresis but not in classic episodic
   pattern.  Elevated urine K and low serum K concerning for primary
   hyperaldosteronism.  TSH normal.
   - will uptitrate labetalol as needed
   - consider spironolactone if further evidence of hyperaldosteronism,
   although would not use without a clear diagnosis, which would require a
   sodium challenge.
   - goal sys bp 150-180
   - follow plasma metanephrine
   - follow MRA of renal arteries
   .
   # PUMP: No hx of heart disease. Acute pulmonary edema in setting of
   hypertension. Currently satting well on 2L NC.  Echo consistent with
   hypertensive changes
   - continue diuresis PRN
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - BP control with labetalol PRN
   .
   # CORONARIES: No hx of CAD. No prior evaluation. Did have lateral ST/TW
   changes on EKG and Tn 0.02->0.06. Likely secondary to demand ischemia
   in the setting of severe hypertension.
   - Recommend outpatient stress test
   - continue ASA 81mg daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with no significant past medical history presenting with hypertensive emergency and acute pulmonary edema. The patient's blood pressure has been increased to 400 mg of labetalol, and he is currently feeling well but experiencing dizziness, nausea, and hiccups. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his oxygen saturation is at 95% on room air. The patient's renal function tests show elevated urine K and low serum K, which may indicate primary hyperaldosteronism. The cardiac echo reveals moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation and elevated left ventricular filling pressures are also noted. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient presented with severe hypertension, leading to hypertensive emergency and acute pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of blood pressure and prompt management are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has evidence of hypertensive heart disease, including left ventricular hypertrophy and elevated filling pressures. These findings suggest potential cardiac complications such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease.
3. Renal complications: The patient's renal function tests show elevated urine potassium and low serum potassium, indicating possible primary hyperaldosteronism. This condition can lead to renal complications such as renal artery stenosis or fibromuscular dysplasia.

   Cardiac ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
   pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with hypertensive emergency and acute pulmonary edema. The patient's current vital signs show a systolic blood pressure of 150, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is on IV fluids and has received labetalol infusions for blood pressure control.

The patient reported feeling well but experienced some dizziness, nausea, and hiccups. The physical examination revealed no chest wall deformities or scoliosis, unlabored respirations, crackles at bilateral bases, and a third heart sound (S3) on auscultation. There were no femoral bruits or peripheral edema noted. Neurological examination was normal.

Laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Electrolyte imbalances were also observed, with low potassium (K+) and elevated sodium (Na+). The cardiac enzyme troponin T was within normal range, suggesting no acute coronary syndrome.

Imaging studies included a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head, which showed patent intracranial arteries without aneurysm or flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion. A cardiac echo revealed moderate symmetric left"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with a hypertensive emergency and acute pulmonary edema. The patient's current vital signs include a systolic blood pressure of 174 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings include crackles at bilateral bases, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and trace aortic regurgitation. Laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, as well as increased potassium and glucose levels. The cardiac echo reveals moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild mitral regurgitation, elevated left ventricular filling pressures, and findings consistent with severe hypertensive heart disease. The patient is currently being treated with diuretics, labetalol for blood pressure control, and antibiotics for infection prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive encephalopathy: Given the patient's high blood pressure and acute presentation, there is a risk of hypertensive encephalopathy, which can cause symptoms such as headache, confusion, and seizures.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which may be related to the patient's severe hypertension and possible hypertensive emergency.
