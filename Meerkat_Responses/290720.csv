   Assessment and Plan
   30yo M s/p overdose on multiple hallucinogens, presenting s/p multiple
   seizures and a fall having complaints of palpitations.
   # Overdose / Intoxication:
   Patient has overdose on multiple hallucinogens and amphetamines in
   addition to rohypnol.  Tachycardia persists but improved w IV valium.
   Pt received significant amount of IV valium overnight with worsening
   delirium in addition to his hallucinations and altered mental status
   from the original overdose.
   - supportive care
   - Appreciate Psych Recs
   - DC IV Valium.
   - Test dose of Zyprexa or Zydus to see if pt really has
   hypoglycemia
likely has hyperglycemia which we can tolerate in this
   setting
   - monitor for serotonin-like syndrome and hyperthermia
   - IVF hydration
   # Rhabdomyolysis:
   Secondary to overdose on amphetamines/PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1418**]. CK elevated to 5000s,
   decreased from 11,000 at outside hospital.  Out of the danger zone, and
   kidneys do not show any mal effect.
   - Normal Saline, titrating urine output to >200ccs/hr to protect
   kidneys until this afternoon, then can slowly taper down fluids
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   - monitor for hyponatremia, electrolyte imbalance
   - LFTs improving, likely secondary to the rhabdo
   # Seizures:
   Likely secondary to the mix of drugs he has taken.  Not likely to
   withdraw from any of these drugs; did not take any alcohol or benzos,
   except Rufenol.
   - pt has received a significant amount of diazepam which should last
   for a long time due to the long half life of the active metabolite, so
   it should very slowly wear off, so he should not seize
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Likely related to the ingestion of these illicit drugs. UA negative for
   infection, and no other source of infection likely, though should
   monitor for infection.
   - culture if spikes, though likely that temp would be from hyperthermia
   related to drugs
   # s/p Fall:
   Had fallen down stairs when having seizures and hit his head. Also fell
   outside.  Has significant occipital pain. No focal neurologic signs
   clinically but difficult to examine patient because so wrestless.
   Still cannot tolerate CT scan
   - Consider Head CT to r/o bleed when stable
   - plain films of back
   - plain films of ankle
   - Pain control w oxycodone 5mg Q4h prn
   # Mood/Psych:
   Denies suicidal intentions, but he has overdosed on so many medications
   so many times
   - appreciate psychiatry recs again and addiction team recs when mental
   status is back to baseline
   # Hepatitis C:
   Hx of Hep C, presumed to be stable. Not a candidate for interferon
   therapy

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 30-year-old male who presented to the ICU after an overdose on multiple hallucinogens and amphetamines, as well as rohypnol. He experienced multiple seizures and a fall, complaining of palpitations. The patient has been receiving supportive care, including IV valium for agitation and hallucinations, but his delirium has worsened. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, with a heart rate in the 90s. His blood pressure is 140/91 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals dilated pupils, alertness, and restlessness. There is tenderness in the low lumbar region and positive straight leg raise test bilaterally. The patient's labs indicate elevated creatine kinase levels, suggesting rhabdomyolysis. His kidney function appears to be normal. 

The patient's assessment includes overdose/intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, leukocytosis, and a fall with occipital pain. The plan includes supportive care, monitoring for serotonin-like syndrome and hyperthermia, and administering a test dose of Zyprexa or Zydus to manage agitation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening delirium, further seizures, development of compartment syndrome due to rhabdomyolysis, and potential infection due to leukocytosis"

","The patient is a 30-year-old male who presented to the hospital after an overdose on multiple hallucinogens. He had complaints of palpitations and experienced multiple seizures, leading to a fall and head injury. The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing management.

The patient's current medications include oxycodone for pain relief, lidocaine patches, and Phenergan for nausea. Nicotine patches are also being used. The patient has been given IV valium based on the CIWA protocol to control agitation and hallucinations.

The patient has a history of Hepatitis C, which may contribute to the elevated liver enzymes. He also has a history of substance abuse, including overdoses on medications in the past. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius (99.6 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His pupils are dilated about 7-8mm symmetrically without a pupillary reflex to light.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) at 9666, indicating rhabdomyolysis. His electrolytes are within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's glucose level is low at 82 mg/dL. Other lab values, such as"

   Assessment and Plan
 Multidrug Overdose
   - ongoing agitation and intermittent panic attacks
   - possibly now with benzo intoxication
   - appreciate psychiatry input, will hold valium and use zydis prn with
   close blood sugar monitoring
   - plan social work/addictions consult once out of acute phase
 Rhabdomyolysis
   - no evidence of renal tubular damage
   - will keep well-hydrated with IVF until PO improved
   - CK now 5900, much improved
 Suicidal Ideation
   - psychiatry following
   - 1:1 sitter at all times
 Transaminitis
   - possibly due to rhabdo
 Tachycardia
   - likely drug effect with likely volume depletion component
   - improved significantly, though still tachycardic
 Leukocytosis
   - likely stress response with component of hemoconcentration
   - improved
? Seizures
   - no witnessed seizures here, but possible witnessed panic attacks
   - follow closely
Chronic pain
   - minimizing additional drugs but continue oxycodone prn
   - lidocaine patches
S/p Fall
   - no focal findings, not stable for imaging but plan for head CT in the
   future

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who presented to the hospital after an overdose on multiple hallucinogens, amphetamines, and Rohypnol. He had complaints of palpitations and experienced multiple seizures. The patient's current condition includes agitation, restlessness, and worsening delirium. His vital signs show a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 124/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's EKG revealed a QTc of 460, indicating a borderline prolonged QT interval. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) suggest rhabdomyolysis secondary to the overdose on amphetamines/PCP. Monitoring for kidney dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances is necessary.

2. Seizures: The patient may be at risk for recurrent seizures due to the mix of drugs taken. Continuous monitoring and administration of diazepam should help prevent further seizures.

3. Hyperthermia: The patient's current hyperthermia could be related to the use of illicit drugs. Close monitoring for increased body temperature is essential.

4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. However, since the urinalysis is negative for infection, ongoing monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.

5. Head Injury: The patient fell down stairs and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who has overdosed on multiple hallucinogens, amphetamines, and Rohypnol. The patient presented with complaints of palpitations and was found to have an elevated heart rate (tachycardia). He also experienced seizures and a fall, resulting in occipital pain but no focal neurologic signs.

The patient's mental status is altered, with worsening delirium and agitation. He has been given Valium, which helped calm him down temporarily, but he still exhibits violent behavior and requires restraints. The patient has an allergy to Zyprexa, which can cause hypoglycemia, so his blood sugar levels need to be monitored closely.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and creatine kinase (CK) levels, indicating possible rhabdomyolysis due to the overdose of amphetamines/PCP. His kidney function appears to be normal, but further evaluation is needed.

The patient has a history of hepatitis C and is not a candidate for interferon therapy. He also has leukocytosis, which may be related to the ingestion of illicit drugs or acute stress response. It is unclear about the trend of the white blood cell count.

The patient's mood and psychological state are of concern, as he admits to suicidal ideations and has a history of overdosing on medications. He may have underlying mood disorders such as panic attacks"
