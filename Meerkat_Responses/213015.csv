   RAS, s/p nephrectomy for RCC, IDDM, and OSA admitted with chest pain
   and by acute renal failure complicated by anasarca now transferred to
   the MICU for NPPV s/p renal angiogram with intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Patient with baseline chronic
   respiratory acidosis suggestive of obstructive lung disease.  Uncertain
   if this is due to obesity hypoventilation versus COPD, although he has
   a baseline PCO2 of 55-60 and HCO3 mid-30s.  In addition, unclear if the
   patient was extubated to NIPPV given his severe OSA (RDI 141). Patient
   appears to be oxygenating well and was diuresed prior to procedure,
   although he still appears peripherally volume overloaded on exam. Will
   defer diuresis given acute on chronic renal failure and contrast load.
   Finally, the patient has increased abdominal distention, which is
   likely contributing to respiratory distress via increased restrictive
   physiology.  Of note, patient was a difficult intubation pre-op.
   - Try to get patient to go back on NIPPV on settings used yesterday
   - Continue to trend ABG with goal PaCO2 55-60, SaO2 >88%
   - If patient refuses, follow clinical status, may have to intubate...of
   note patient is a difficult airway...be sure to tell anesthesia
   - Hold diuresis in setting of IV dye load
   - Repeat CXR
   - Duonebs prn
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Unknown etiology at this time. Per
   report, renal angiogram without increased stenosis and no intervention
   performed. Patient is at inreased risk for contrast-induced nephropathy
   given contrast load.
   - Trend lytes, creatinine, and UOP
   - Follow-up recs with transplant nephrology and vascular surgery
   - NAC 600mg po BID
   - Continue prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil
   .
   # HTN: Patient has baseline hypertension with SBP 150-200.
   - Discontinue labetalol drip
   - Start clonidine, labetalol, amlodipine (if mental status declining
   consider labetalol IV prn)
   - Goal SBP 150
   - Hold lisinopril for now
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct in 30s, currently at 25.3. Of note, patient has
   history of intravascular hemolysis s/p prior renal angiogram.
   - Trend hct Q12H
   - AM hemolysis labs - haptoglobin,
   - Active T+S with access
   .
   # IDDM: Continue NPH and HISS.
   .
   # Chest Pain: Unable to obtain ROS currently, but on review of records
   chest pain has since resolved s/p admission.  Most likely etiology is
   GERD with flat cardiac biomarkers and unchanged ECG.
   - Continue omeprazole, maalox
   .
   # GERD: Patient with history of GERD and Barrett's esophagus.
   - PPI as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cortical renal transplantation complicated by chronic allograft nephropathy and transplant renal artery stenosis, post-nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted with chest pain and acute renal failure complicated by anasarca and is now in the MICU for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) after a renal angiogram with intubation.

24-hour events include attempts to adjust NPPV settings due to high oxygen levels and carbon dioxide levels in the 80s. Labetolol drip was given for blood pressure control, and the patient had a low-grade fever. An arterial line was started.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels are elevated. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis with a high carbon dioxide level. Other lab results include elevated glucose, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Imaging shows a chest X-ray.

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10044**], a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-corticosteroid-responsive thrombotic microangiopathy (CRT), chronic allograft nephropathy, transplant renal artery stenosis, nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), was admitted with chest pain and acute renal failure complicated by anasarca. He is currently in the MICU for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) after a renal angiogram with intubation.

The patient has a baseline chronic respiratory acidosis suggestive of obstructive lung disease, possibly obesity hypoventilation or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with a baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 55-60 and bicarbonate (HCO3) in the mid-30s. It is uncertain if he was extubated to NIPPV given his severe OSA (respiratory disturbance index of 141). He appears to be oxygenating well and was diuresed prior to the procedure, although he still appears peripherally volume overloaded on examination. The plan is to defer diuresis due to acute on chronic renal failure and contrast load. The patient also has increased abdominal distention, which is likely contributing to respiratory distress via increased restrictive physiology. Notably"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   61 yr old man with hypercarbic resp failure
   Hypercarbic Resp Distress: started on NIPPV acutely in setting of
   extubation without adequate mental status in setting of known severe
   OSA.  In terms of chronic resp acidosis likely some element of
   restriction with abd and possible obesity hypoventilation and will need
   comprehensive plan long term or chronic hypoventilation.
   The fact that he remains essentially BIPAP dependent is concerning and
   hopefully we will be able to gain som e ground this AM or he will
   require reintubation as he ultimately will need nutrition, po meds, and
   could develop skin breakdown
   ARF: overall trend had been improving but this was prior to the dye
   load of Angio and now up a bit today
   Need to manage expectantly
   Continue prednisone and cellcept.
   Severe HTN: using IV labetalol now. Hop to be able to wean of NIPPV and
   restart home meds.
   Anemia - history of intravasc hemolysis so needs close trending
   stable
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff

   61 yr old man with hypercarbic resp failure
   Hypercarbic Resp Distress: started on NIPPV acutely in setting of
   extubation without adequate mental status in setting of known severe
   OSA.  In terms of chronic resp acidosis likely some element of
   restriction with abd and possible obesity hypoventilation and will need
   comprehensive plan long termf or chronic hypoventilation.
   ARF: overall trend had been improving but this was prior to the dye

   Need to manage expectantly
   Continue prednisone and cellcept.
   Severe HTN: using IV labetalol now. Hoep to be able to wean of NIPPV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with respiratory failure, hypertension, and a history of intravascular hemolysis. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory distress and malignant hypertension. The patient has been on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) due to extubation without adequate mental status in the setting of known severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He also has chronic respiratory acidosis likely caused by abdominal restriction, possible obesity hypoventilation, and will require a comprehensive long-term plan for chronic hypoventilation.

The patient's arterial line was started on 08/23/2107 at 07:02 PM. He has been on BIPAP most of the evening, with lower PEEP and volumes but higher PaCO2 possibly due to a leak. He was started on labetalol drip for hypertension. The patient has allergies to vancomycin, which caused a rash. His last dose of antibiotics was infusions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/62 mmHg to 213/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's flow sheet data shows fluid balance with a total input of 1,548 mL and output"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with respiratory failure, acute hypertension, and a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and has been experiencing hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/62 to 213/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds, somnolence, and right and left lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, hypertension, and anemia, as well as expectant management of acute renal failure. The patient is expected to continue receiving ICU care with NIPPV and restart of home medications once stable."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10044**] is a 61 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for ESRD
   s/p CRT complicated by chronic allograft nephropathy and transplant
   RAS, s/p nephrectomy for RCC, IDDM, and OSA admitted with chest pain
   and by acute renal failure complicated by anasarca now transferred to
   the MICU for NPPV s/p renal angiogram with intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Patient with baseline chronic
   respiratory acidosis suggestive of obstructive lung disease.  Uncertain
   if this is due to obesity hypoventilation versus COPD, although he has
   a baseline PCO2 of 55-60 and HCO3 mid-30s.  In addition, unclear if the
   patient was extubated to NIPPV given his severe OSA (RDI 141). Patient
   appears to be oxygenating well and was diuresed prior to procedure,
   although he still appears peripherally volume overloaded on exam. Will
   defer diuresis given acute on chronic renal failure and contrast load.
   Finally, the patient has increased abdominal distention, which is
   likely contributing to respiratory distress via increased restrictive
   physiology.  Of note, patient was a difficult intubation pre-op.
   - Patient on BiPAP, follow clinical status and ABG
 PaCO2 55-60, SaO2
   >88%
   -Patient off BiPAP yesterday evening, back on overnight.
   - CXR monitoring
 slightly improved today.
   - Will take off BiPAP again today, monitor response.
   - if clinical status worsens
patient is a difficult intubation
   - Duonebs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Etiology thought to be
   contrast-induced nephropathy. Per report, renal angiogram without
   increased stenosis and no intervention performed. Patient is at
   inreased risk for contrast-induced nephropathy given contrast load.
   -Renal following, continue to recommend conservative management
 keep
   even, continue meds.  Creatinine continues to rise slowly, which is
   consistent with a contrast-induced nephropathy, in which creatinine
   should plateau after 2-3 days, then decline.
   - Trend lytes, creatinine, and UOP
   - Continue prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil
   .
   # HTN: Patient has baseline hypertension with SBP 150-200.
   - Discontinued labetolol drip
   - Yesterday started clonidine, labetalol, amlodipine (if mental status
   declining consider labetalol IV prn).  Mental status improved, pressure
   elevated but mostly stable, slightly above goal.
   - Goal SBP 150
   - Hold lisinopril for now
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct in 30s. Of note, patient has history of
   intravascular hemolysis s/p prior renal angiogram.
   - Trend hct
 today 25.6, will repeat in 12 hours.
   - Hemolysis labs WNL yesterday.
   - Active T+S with access.
   .
   # IDDM: Continue NPH and HISS at half doses.  BS well controlled.
   .
   # Chest Pain: Resolved since resolved s/p admission.  Most likely
   etiology is GERD with flat cardiac biomarkers and unchanged ECG.
   Patient denies any chest pain today or yesterday.
   - Continue omeprazole, maalox
   .
   # GERD: Patient with history of GERD and Barrett's esophagus.
   - PPI as above.
   .
   FEN: Has been NPO for past 2 days except for meds.  Will try to resume
   PO intake if tolerating off BiPAP today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone chronic renal transplant (CRT) complicated by chronic allograft nephropathy and transplant renal artery stenosis (RAS). The patient also has a history of idiopathic diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted with chest pain and acute renal failure, complicated by anasarca, and is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) after a renal angiogram with intubation.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory distress, acute-on-chronic renal failure, hypertension (malignant hypertensive crisis), anemia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient is on BiPAP, and his PaCO2 levels are 55-60, with SaO2 greater than 88%. He has slightly improved on the chest X-ray today. 

The patient's renal function has worsened, and it is believed to be due to contrast-induced nephropathy. Conservative management is recommended, and his medications should be continued. His creatinine levels continue to rise slowly, which is consistent with contrast-induced nephropathy. 

The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is on multiple antihypertensive medications"

   # Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Patient with baseline chronic
   respiratory acidosis suggestive of obstructive lung disease.  Uncertain
   if this is due to obesity hypoventilation versus COPD, although he has
   a baseline PCO2 of 55-60 and HCO3 mid-30s.  In addition, unclear if the
   patient was extubated to NIPPV given his severe OSA (RDI 141). Patient
   appears to be oxygenating well and was diuresed prior to procedure,
   although he still appears peripherally volume overloaded on exam. Will
   defer diuresis given acute on chronic renal failure and contrast load.
   Finally, the patient has increased abdominal distention, which is
   likely contributing to respiratory distress via increased restrictive
   physiology.  Of note, patient was a difficult intubation pre-op.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-corticosteroid-responsive transplant (CRT) complicated by chronic allograft nephropathy and transplant renal artery stenosis (RAS), post-nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient was admitted with chest pain and acute renal failure, and is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) after a renal angiogram with intubation.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hypercarbic respiratory distress, acute on chronic renal failure, hypertension (malignant hypertensive crisis), anemia, IDDM, chest pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 159/73 mmHg to 191/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on BiPAP, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL, platelet count of 179 K/uL,"

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic allograft nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient was admitted with chest pain and acute renal failure, complicated by anasarca. He underwent a renal angiogram and was intubated. 

The patient has hypercarbic respiratory distress with a baseline chronic respiratory acidosis. It is uncertain whether this is due to obesity hypoventilation or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's peripheral oxygenation is good, but he appears volume overloaded. There is also increased abdominal distention contributing to restrictive physiology. 

The patient's acute renal failure is thought to be caused by contrast-induced nephropathy from the renal angiogram. His creatinine levels are rising slowly, consistent with contrast-induced nephropathy. 

The patient has hypertension with a baseline blood pressure of 150-200 mmHg. Medications have been adjusted to control blood pressure. 

The patient has anemia with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) in the 30s. There is a history of intravascular hemolysis following a prior renal angiogram.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been on NIPPV but is now able to come off it during the day and has agreed to wear it overnight with good effect. The patient has allergies to vancomycin and has experienced a rash from the last dose of antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated blood pressure and heart rate, with a normal temperature and respiratory rate. The patient's weight is 109.6 kg, which is slightly higher than their admission weight of 107.4 kg. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 860 mL and output of 835 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 25 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a face tent, standby ventilator mode, and low levels of FiO2 and PEEP. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals faint bibasilar rales, right lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity edema. The patient is alert and conversant, with warm skin. Lab results show elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, and sodium levels. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, while the platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values are within normal limits or show slight variations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial complaint was respiratory distress, and they are still receiving respiratory support."

 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   Hypercarbic Resp Distress: started on NIPPV acutely in setting of
   extubation without adequate mental status in setting of known severe
   OSA.  In terms of chronic resp acidosis likely some element of
   restriction with abd and possible obesity hypoventilation and will need
   comprehensive plan long term or chronic hypoventilation.
   The fact that he remains essentially BIPAP dependent is concerning and
   hopefully we will be able to gain som e ground this AM or he will
   require reintubation as he ultimately will need nutrition, po meds, and
   could develop skin breakdown
   ARF: overall trend had been improving but this was prior to the dye
   load of Angio and now up a bit today. Need to manage expectantly.
   Continue prednisone and cellcept.
   Severe HTN: using IV labetalol now. Hop to be able to wean of NIPPV and
   restart home meds.
   Anemia - history of intravasc hemolysis so needs close trending

   Total time spent:
","The patient presents with respiratory distress and has a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which may contribute to hypercarbic respiratory failure. They were initially on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) but were able to come off it. However, the patient remains essentially bipap dependent, indicating a need for further evaluation and management.

The patient also has malignant hypertension, for which they are being treated with intravenous labetalol. There is concern about reintubation if the patient does not improve.

Acute kidney injury (ARF) was improving prior to the administration of contrast dye during an angiogram, but has now worsened. The patient is being managed expectantly and continues to receive prednisone and cellcept.

The patient has a history of intravascular hemolysis and anemia. Close monitoring of lab trends is necessary.

There are ongoing issues related to ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines (arterial line and central venous line), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Overall, the patient's conditions appear to be complex and require close monitoring and management in the ICU. Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, uncontrolled hypertension, acute kidney injury, anemia, and infections such as DVT and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   Hypercarbic Resp Distress: started on NIPPV acutely in setting of
   extubation without adequate mental status in setting of known severe
   OSA.  In terms of chronic resp acidosis likely some element of
   restriction with abd and possible obesity hypoventilation and will need
   comprehensive plan long term or chronic hypoventilation.
   The fact that he remains essentially BIPAP dependent is concerning and
   hopefully we will be able to gain som e ground this AM or he will
   require reintubation as he ultimately will need nutrition, po meds, and
   could develop skin breakdown
   ARF: overall trend had been improving but this was prior to the dye
   load of Angio and now up a bit today. Need to manage expectantly.
   Continue prednisone and cellcept.
   Severe HTN: using IV labetalol now. Hop to be able to wean of NIPPV and
   restart home meds.
   Anemia - history of intravasc hemolysis so needs close trending

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress, and they were recently extubated but required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) due to inadequate mental status and severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient has a history of chronic respiratory acidosis, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and requires long-term or chronic hypoventilation management.

The patient is also diagnosed with malignant hypertension (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), anemia related to intravascular hemolysis, and acute kidney injury (ARF) that was improving but has now worsened after receiving contrast during an angiogram.

The plan moving forward includes continuing NIPPV with hopes of weaning off soon, restarting home medications, managing severe hypertension with IV labetalol, and monitoring anemia trends closely. The patient's other medical issues, such as nutrition, glycemic control, lines (arterial line and central line), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), will be managed by the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that could arise include worsening respiratory failure if NIPPV is not effective or if reintubation is required. The patient's hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications associated with uncontrolled high blood pressure, such as stroke or"
