   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   PCP reports that patient with history of pancytopenia d/t MDS. Not
   treated given patient's age/comorbidities; saw hematology as outpatient
   and decided not to bone marrow biopsy or workup/treat to an excessive
   degree. Platelets typically 50-60, WBC typically 2, Hct typically
   28-30. Labs monitored monthly by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] without intervention thus
   far.
   Transfused 2 units over day/night. Hct bumped what seemed to be an
   appropriate amount as the 2nd unit finished infusing, but then next lab
   check (this AM) demonstrated slight Hct drop again when it should have
   been stable or even risen slightly.
   ECHO:
   LVEF 40 percent
   Hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls
   Increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg)
   Severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
   Mild MR; Moderate TR
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   -Compared to 1 year ago, RV now appears somewhat hypokinetic.
   Cath report:
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Left main coronary artery disease.
   2. Placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LMCA.
   3. Moderate aortic stenosis.
   4. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   5. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo gentleman with hx of AS, CAD, admitted out of concern for
   worsening AS, now s/p cath with LAD stent placement (no valvuloplasty
   performed); stable on transfer to the floor. With anemia appearing
   lower than baseline (baseline anemic d/t MDS) was transfused two units
   over [**Date range (1) 10617**].
   .
   # CORONARIES: Mr [**Known lastname 1138**] has a history of CAD with stent placement to the
   LAD [**3-27**] and known RCA occlusion. He does not have any recent history
   of CP or pressure and ST depressions on EKG do not appear to be acute
   changes.  Cath showed LAD stent-rethrombosis, therefore new stent
   placed.
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel
   -holding heparin and integrillin for now given that this does not
   appear to be ACS
   .
   # PUMP: Systolic and diastolic function. Volume overloaded on exam
   previously. PCWP elevated at 40. Met diuresis goal of negative 1L over
   last 24 hours.
   -examine patient this morning with the team and reassess volume status;
   diuresed well and with history of AS [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 481**] to overdiurese given
   preload dependence
   -continue metoprolol at 25 [**Hospital1 7**] given lower BP
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: While ECHO [**2197-9-21**] showed severe stenosis, cath here
   demonstrated only moderate area 0.96 and valve gradient 15.01 therefore
   valvuloplasty was deferred. Repeat echo on [**9-28**] demonstrates severe but
   not critical AS.
   -monitor as an outpatient
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR. Monitor on tele.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Patient has prior leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia
 known (and untreated) MDS per his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] anemia seen post-cath;
   transfused 2 units, saw appropriate Hct rise and then slight decrease
   of Hct again this morning. Given history of GI bleed (and without
   obvious source of bleed at this time), will monitor closely and consult
   GI if needed.
   - recheck Hct this AM and then PM
   - guaiac stool
   .
   # Renal artery stenosis: will repeat renal US non-urgently to evaluate
   for progression of disease

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and untreated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The patient was admitted for worsening aortic stenosis and subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization with left main coronary artery disease and placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LMCA. The stent placement was due to LAD stent rethrombosis. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/38 mmHg to 115/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.7 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 49 K/uL. Other lab values include elevated glucose levels, slightly decreased calcium levels, and normal magnesium and phosphate levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Coronaries: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a stent placement in the LAD. A recent catheterization revealed LAD stent rethrombosis, which was treated with the placement of a new stent. The patient will"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of pancytopenia due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). He has received monthly monitoring of his blood counts but has not undergone treatment. The patient's platelet count is typically around 50-60, white blood cell count is usually 2, and hematocrit level is between 28-30. He required transfusion of 2 units of blood products, but his hematocrit level dropped again afterward.

The patient has several cardiac conditions including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%, hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, increased left ventricular filling pressure, severe aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2, mild mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Additionally, he has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone stent placement in the left main coronary artery.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. He is currently receiving various ICU medications and other medications. There are no changes to his medical or family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), current temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 81 bpm with a range of 72-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/33 mmHg to 115/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute with a range of 11-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's height is 64 inches, and he has received a total of 1202 mL of fluids since midnight.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1202 mL, with outputs including 400 mL of PO, 750 mL of blood products, and 2225 mL of urine. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 51 mmHg and central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an oxygen saturation of 96%. His ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings are incomplete, including peripheral vascular assessment, skin examination, and neurologic assessment.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 1.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 42 mg/dL, sodium of 31 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mEq/L, calcium of 142 mg/dL, glucose of 128 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.6 mEq/L, and phosphate of 7"

   28-30. Labs monitored monthly by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] without intervention thus
   far.
   Transfused 2 units over day/night. Hct bumped what seemed to be an
   appropriate amount as the 2nd unit finished infusing, but then next lab
   check (this AM) demonstrated slight Hct drop again when it should have

   [**Age over 90 **] yo gentleman with hx of AS, CAD, admitted out of concern for
   worsening AS, now s/p cath with LAD stent placement (no valvuloplasty
   performed); stable on transfer to the floor. With anemia appearing
   lower than baseline (baseline anemic d/t MDS) was transfused two units
   over [**Date range (1) 10617**].
   .
   # CORONARIES: Mr [**Known lastname 1138**] has a history of CAD with stent placement to the
   LAD [**3-27**] and known RCA occlusion. He does not have any recent history
   of CP or pressure and ST depressions on EKG do not appear to be acute
   changes.  Cath showed LAD stent-rethrombosis, therefore new stent
   placed.
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel
   -holding heparin and integrillin for now given that this does not
   appear to be ACS
   .
   # PUMP: Systolic and diastolic function. Volume overloaded on exam
   previously. PCWP elevated at 40. Met diuresis goal of negative 1L over
   last 24 hours.
   -examine patient this morning with the team and reassess volume status;
   diuresed well and with history of AS [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 481**] to overdiurese given
   preload dependence
   -continue metoprolol at 25 [**Hospital1 7**] given lower BP
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: While ECHO [**2197-9-21**] showed severe stenosis, cath here
   demonstrated only moderate area 0.96 and valve gradient 15.01 therefore
   valvuloplasty was deferred. Repeat echo on [**9-28**] demonstrates severe but
   not critical AS.
   -monitor as an outpatient
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR. Monitor on tele.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Patient has prior leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia
 known (and untreated) MDS per his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] anemia seen post-cath;
   transfused 2 units, saw appropriate Hct rise and then slight decrease
   of Hct again this morning. Given history of GI bleed (and without
   obvious source of bleed at this time), will monitor closely and consult
   GI if needed.
   - recheck Hct this AM and then PM
   - guaiac stool
   .
   # Renal artery stenosis: will repeat renal US non-urgently to evaluate
   for progression of disease

   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10453**] today and
   I concur with the History, Physical examination, and Medical Decision
   Making.  My examination is consistent with the examination documented
   in the note.
   Medical Decision Making.   He is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with aortic stenosis
   ([**Location (un) 342**] 0.9 cm2) and left main coronary artery disease.  He underwent
   repeat intervention of the left main yesterday.    His PCWP was 40 mmHg
   during the catheterization and he has been diuresed 1 L over the past
   24 hours.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted due to concerns about worsening AS and subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization with placement of a drug-eluting stent in the left main coronary artery (LAD). The patient's anemia appeared lower than baseline, so he was transfused with two units of blood.

The patient has a history of CAD, with a previous stent placement in the LAD and known right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion. There is no recent history of chest pain (CP), and ST depressions on EKG do not appear to be acute changes. The catheterization showed LAD stent-rethrombosis, and a new stent was placed.

The patient's pump function is compromised, with systolic and diastolic dysfunction. He was previously found to be volume overloaded and had an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 40 mmHg. The patient met his diuresis goal of negative 1L over the last 24 hours. It is recommended to examine the patient this morning with the team and reassess volume status. Diuretics will be continued, and metoprolol will be maintained at 25 mg given lower blood pressure.

The patient's aortic stenosis is classified as severe but not critical, as demonstrated by the recent echo"

   # CORONARIES: Mr [**Known lastname 1138**] has a history of CAD with stent placement to the
   LAD [**3-27**] and known RCA occlusion. He does not have any recent history
   of CP or pressure and ST depressions on EKG do not appear to be acute
   changes.  Cath showed LAD stent-rethrombosis, therefore new stent
   placed.
   -continue ASA, clopidogrel
   -holding heparin and integrillin for now given that this does not
   appear to be ACS
   .
   # PUMP: Systolic and diastolic function. Volume overloaded on exam
   previously. PCWP elevated at 40. Met diuresis goal of negative 1L over
   last 24 hours.
   -examine patient this morning with the team and reassess volume status;
   diuresed well and with history of AS [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 481**] to overdiurese given
   preload dependence
   -continue metoprolol at 25 [**Hospital1 7**] given lower BP
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: While ECHO [**2197-9-21**] showed severe stenosis, cath here
   demonstrated only moderate area 0.96 and valve gradient 15.01 therefore
   valvuloplasty was deferred. Repeat echo on [**9-28**] demonstrates severe but
   not critical AS.
   -monitor as an outpatient
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR. Monitor on tele.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Patient has prior leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia
 known (and untreated) MDS per his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] anemia seen post-cath;
   transfused 2 units, saw appropriate Hct rise and then slight decrease
   of Hct again this morning. Given history of GI bleed (and without
   obvious source of bleed at this time), will monitor closely and consult
   GI if needed.
   - recheck Hct this AM and then PM
   - guaiac stool
   .
   # Renal artery stenosis: will repeat renal US non-urgently to evaluate
   for progression of disease
   .
   # Diabetes
   -continue home insulin dose
   -diabetic diet.
   # Hypocalcemia
   -Albumin added onto morning

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease. He underwent a cardiac catheterization and had a stent placed in the left main coronary artery. The patient's blood counts indicate pancytopenia due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), for which he has not been treated. He received a blood transfusion of two units, but his hematocrit (Hct) level dropped slightly despite the transfusion.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 81 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 90/38 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 37.7°C.

His echocardiogram (ECHO) reveals left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%, hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP > 18mmHg), severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2), mild mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's renal function is within normal limits, but he has hypocalcemia. His glucose level is elevated"
