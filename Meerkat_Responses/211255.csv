","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was initially admitted to the hospital for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, most likely of hospital-acquired origin. He is currently receiving vancomycin and cefepime as part of his treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently in the 90s systolic without the need for IVF boluses, indicating that he is not in shock but still experiencing low blood pressure. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia, likely caused by hospital-acquired pathogens. Treatment with vancomycin and cefepime is ongoing, but additional investigations are needed to identify the specific causative organism. This includes pending tests for Legionella antigen, beta-glucan, galactomannan, histoplasma, cryptococcus, and toxoplasma. A bronchoscopy may be performed tomorrow to evaluate the airways and obtain specimens for atypical pathogens.

3. Immunocompromised State: The patient's immunocompromised state due to ongoing treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma puts him at a higher risk for opportunistic infections. Further investigations are necessary to rule out"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is also being treated for other potential infections such as tuberculosis, Legionella, histoplasma, cryptococcus, toxoplasma, and atypical pathogens. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, tachycardia, and worsening oxygen requirements.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: Given the patient's fever, hypotension, and worsening oxygen requirements, there is a risk of developing septic shock due to the ongoing infection.
2. Multi-drug resistant pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may be resistant to multiple antibiotics, making it difficult to treat effectively.
3. Pneumothorax: The new right upper lobe infiltrate could potentially lead to pneumothorax, which can cause respiratory distress.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's known cancer increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, and his symptoms may suggest this possibility.
5. Cardiac ischemia: Although cardiac enzymes are negative, there is still a risk of cardiac ischemia due to the patient's underlying conditions.
6. Fluid overload: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual who was admitted with a chief complaint of hypotension and pneumonia. They have been receiving aggressive treatment, but their symptoms have not improved significantly. The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 101.8 degrees Celsius, tachycardia with a heart rate of 110-125 beats per minute, low blood pressure ranging from 113/57 to 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's blood work reveals leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.1 K/uL, normal hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, slightly elevated platelet count of 123 K/uL, and decreased hematocrit of 25.6%. Other lab results show elevated creatinine levels and abnormal coagulation parameters. The patient's condition is being managed with antibiotics, antifungals, and other supportive measures in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. It is important to closely monitor vital signs and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation of 91% indicates potential respiratory compromise. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and oxygen delivery is necessary.
3. Organ dysfunction: The elevated"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   60 year old M with h/o of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six cycles
   of MR-CHOP) presented on [**11-23**] with fevers and new right upper lobe
   infiltrate -- > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, now s/p bronchoscopy.
    #Fevers/Hypotension/Tachycardia:  On admission fit SIRS, but not shock
   criteria; End organs without dysfunction.   Blood pressures currently
   in 110
s systolic without need for IVF boluses. Source of SIRS likely
   pulmoary. Urine/PICC cultures negarive. On Bactrim, so PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 6832**]. Bronchoscopy [**2126-10-29**] with negative AFB, so  tuberculosis
   also less likely, but given concern on subsequent radiology, have
   started precautions.  Atypical pathogens and [**Month/Day/Year 1156**] diseases are
   possible given location of infiltrate and immunocompromised state.
   Currently on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   -f/uLegionella antigen, beta-glucan, galactomannan, are all pending.
   -Toxo and crypto neg. Rapid respi Viral test negative.  Histoplasma
   negative.
-Bronchoalveolar Lavage showed:
-GRAM STAIN (Final [**2126-11-26**]):
      4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
   - induced sputum for gram stain, culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**] culture
   - nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza and viral screen
   - f/u brocn cultures
   - currently on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   Plan to add azithro s/p bronch?
   - will leave PICC in place for now with low threshold for removing
   - follow up blood and urine cultures, negative thus far
   - will send mycolytic cultures
   - f/u urine histoplasma, urine legionella, urine AFB, serum toxoplasma,
   serum cryptococcal Ag, serum coccidiodes antibiotics, serum
   strongyloides
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   - if signs of decompensation would add [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**] coverage as well as
   levofloxacin for atypical pneumonia
   Hypoxia:  New oxygen requirement over past 24 hours.  Pulmonary
   embolism is a concern (known cancer), but Lovneox makes less likekely.
   No evidence to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative
   cardiac enzymes. No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on
   exam.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - if worsening pulmonary status would consider repeat CT scan to assess
   for PE as well as worsening interstitial disease
   Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP now
   on day 15. Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his counts
   have recovered although he remains thrombocytopenic and anemic.
   - hematocrit goal > 25 (received one unit today)
   - no indication for platelet transfusion at this time
   - not neutropenic
   - continue bactrim for prophylaxis
   DVT: Diagnosed in [**Month (only) 1033**].  On lovenox on admission.  They are not
   painful.
   - holding lovenox
   - heparin gtt in preparation for possible procedure
   FEN: Neutropenic low acid diet, NPO after midnight for possible
   bronchoscopy, monitor electrolytes, IVF for urine output < 50 cc/hr,
   MAP < 65
   Access: left sided pICC
   Prophylaxis: heparin IV, bowel regimen, home PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and was found to have pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. The patient is also thrombocytopenic and anemic but not neutropenic.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently in the range of 110 systolic without the need for IVF boluses. This may indicate ongoing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis or other underlying causes.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, as evidenced by the presence of fever, new infiltrate on chest X-ray, and positive Gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Appropriate antibiotics have been started, but there is a concern for atypical pathogens and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a known DVT and is currently on lovenox for prophylaxis. However, there is a mention of holding lovenox and preparing for a possible procedure, suggesting a potential risk for clot propagation or new clot formation.

4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's known cancer history and new oxygen requirements"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-appearing man in the ICU who underwent bronchoscopy due to concerns of dilated right upper lobe airways on chest X-ray. The bronchoscopy was unremarkable except for the dilation of the RUL airways. The patient has been placed on tuberculosis precautions. The patient's fever, which started on 11/26 at 03:00 PM, is currently being managed with antifungals as per infectious disease recommendations while awaiting bronchial cultures.

The patient has no known drug allergies. Antibiotics were administered, including vancomycin and cefepime. The patient is also receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and enoxaparin (Lovenox). Other medications are being administered as well.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. Vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/57 mmHg to 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-appearing man who is comfortable and appropriate, with clear lungs and no signs of respiratory distress. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and there are no murmurs or carotid bruits. The"

   infiltrate -- > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, now s/p bronchoscopy.
    #Fevers/Hypotension/Tachycardia:  On admission fit SIRS, but not shock
   criteria; End organs without dysfunction.   Blood pressures currently
   in 90
s in setting of A fib as opposed to sepsis. Source of earlier
   SIRS likely pulmonary. Urine/PICC cultures negarive. On Bactrim, so PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 6832**]. Bronchoscopy [**2126-10-29**] with negative AFB, so  tuberculosis
   also less likely, but given concern on subsequent radiology, have
   started precautions.  Atypical pathogens and [**Month/Day/Year 1156**] diseases are

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was admitted to the hospital and later transferred to the ICU due to worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is currently on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis and is on lovenox for prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms of pneumonia, including fevers, hypoxia, and a new infiltrate on chest X-ray. He is currently being treated with antibiotics, but there is a concern for atypical pathogens or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: Given the patient's known cancer and recent immobilization, there is a concern for pulmonary embolism. A repeat CT scan may be considered if the patient's pulmonary status worsens.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: Although the patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, there is still a possibility of cardiac ischemia due to his atrial fibrillation and risk factors.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive at times, requiring IV fluid boluses. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was initially treated with antibiotics but developed hypotension, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. A bronchoscopy was performed, revealing no evidence of tuberculosis or other infections. The patient is currently on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia and azithromycin after bronchoscopy. Additional tests, including Legionella antigen, beta-glucan, and galactomannan, are pending. The patient's blood and urine cultures are negative so far. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and an earlier echo showing a myxoma, which was reported to have cleared. He required Lopressor and later Diltiazem to control his heart rate. Metoprolol has been started for a goal heart rate under 100 with pressures above 90 systolic. A repeat echo is planned. The patient's oxygen requirements have increased over the past 24 hours, and pulmonary embolism is a concern. No evidence of cardiac ischemia or pulmonary edema is seen on examination. Weaning of oxygen is planned, and consideration will be given to a repeat CT scan for PE assessment. The patient is also thrombocytopenic and anemic due to ongoing chemotherapy, but not neutropenic. Prophylactic measures include lovenox for DVT, bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia, and heparin for PICC line. The patient's code status is full code, and he will continue to receive ICU care."

    #Fevers/Hypotension/Tachycardia:  On admission fit SIRS, but not shock
   criteria; End organs without dysfunction.   Blood pressures currently
   in 90's in setting of A fib as opposed to sepsis. Source of earlier
   SIRS likely pulmonary. Urine/PICC cultures negarive. On Bactrim, so PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 6832**]. Bronchoscopy [**2126-10-29**] with negative AFB, so  tuberculosis
   also less likely, but given concern on subsequent radiology, have
   started precautions.  Atypical pathogens and [**Month/Day/Year 1156**] diseases are
   possible given location of infiltrate and immunocompromised state.

   A fib. Patient has history of A fib in past. Episodes this AM were
   asymptomatic; perhaps precipitated by fevers. Patient has earlier ECHO
   demonstrating myxoma which subsequently was reported to have cleared.
   This AM, required Lopressor times two for HR to 170's, asymptomatic,
   with limited result. Then gave Dilt 5 mg times two with better control.
   -Starting Metoprolol 25-50BID for goal HR under 100 with presssures
   above 90 systolic.
   -Repeat ECHO
   Hypoxia:  New oxygen requirement over past 24 hours.  Pulmonary
   embolism is a concern (known cancer), but Lovneox makes less likekely.
   No evidence to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative
   cardiac enzymes. No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on
   exam.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin, and enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but further investigations are pending, including induced sputum for gram stain, culture, and PCP testing.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently in the 70s, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or other underlying causes. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary. Further evaluation may include echocardiography to assess cardiac function and fluid responsiveness.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed case of pneumonia, likely hospital-acquired given the timing of symptoms and radiological findings. The causative organism is currently unknown, with pending tests for Legionella antigen, beta-glucan, galactomannan, and bronchoalveolar lavage culture. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but adjustments may be required based"

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   60 year old M with h/o of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six cycles
   of MR-CHOP) presented on [**11-23**] with fevers and new right upper lobe
   infiltrate -- > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, now s/p bronchoscopy with CXR with
   worsening right lope diffuse infiltrate.
    #Fevers/Hypotension/Tachycardia:  On admission fit SIRS, but not shock
   criteria; End organs without dysfunction.   Blood pressures currently
   above 110, no continuing A Fib. Source of earlier SIRS likely
   pulmonary. Urine/PICC cultures negarive. On Bactrim, so PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 6832**]. Bronchoscopy [**2126-10-29**] with negative AFB, so  tuberculosis
   also less likely, but given concern on subsequent radiology, have
   started precautions.  Atypical pathogens and [**Month/Day/Year 1156**] diseases are
   possible given location of infiltrate and immunocompromised state.
   Currently on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia,
   Azithro started s/p bronch. Flagyl started yesterday. Planning for VATS
   today.
   -VATS today. Has been NPO after mindight. Ensure active type and
   screen.
   -Toxo and crypto neg. Rapid respi Viral test negative.  Histoplasma
   negative.
   -Bronchoalveolar Lavage showed:

   -f/u  induced sputum for gram stain, culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**] culture
   - currently on vancomycin and cefepime, Azithro HAP, Flagyl
   - will leave PICC in place for now with low threshold for removing
   - follow up outstanding cultures/assays.
   - f/u  mycolytic cultures
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   A fib. Patient has history of A fib in past. Episodes two days ago were
   asymptomatic; perhaps precipitated by fevers. Patient has earlier ECHO
   demonstrating myxoma which subsequently was reported to have cleared,
   now clear on yesterday
s ECHO. In NSR over last 24 hours.
   -Continuing Dilt 30mg PO QID
   Hypoxia:  New oxygen requirement over past 24 hours.  Pulmonary
   embolism is a concern (known cancer), but Lovneox makes less likekely.
   No evidence to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative
   cardiac enzymes. No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on
   exam.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   -Con't Lovenox
   - if worsening pulmonary status would consider repeat CT scan to assess
   for PE as well as worsening interstitial disease
   Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP now
   on day 15. Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his counts
   have recovered although he remains thrombocytopenic and anemic.
   - monitor HCT, with hematocrit goal > 25
   - not neutropenic
   - continue bactrim for prophylaxis
   DVT: Diagnosed in [**Month (only) 1033**].  On lovenox on admission.  They are not

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, as well as Flagyl for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to his transfer to the ICU for further management and planned VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) biopsy of the right-sided pulmonary process.

The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. His blood pressures are currently above 110, and he does not have any ongoing atrial fibrillation. The patient is on Bactrim for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and tuberculosis is less likely given a negative bronchoscopy with AFB (acid-fast bacilli). However, precautions have been started due to concerns about atypical pathogens and other diseases.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 6.3-10.0 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 85-167 K/uL. Renal function tests show normal creatinine levels, while liver enzymes and electrolyte levels are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who was admitted for pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia. He had recent hospitalization for pneumonia and was readmitted with a right upper lobe infiltrate and fever. He has been febrile and had progression of dense right-sided consolidation by CT. A flexible bronchoscopy with BAL showed gram-positive cocci. The patient is now in the MICU for VATS with biopsy of the right-sided pulmonary process. His last dose of antibiotics was on [**2126-11-29**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of immunocompromised state due to lymphoma and recent infections suggests a high risk of infection. Broad coverage antibiotics have been initiated, but ongoing monitoring for any signs of infection is crucial.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's new oxygen requirement indicates possible worsening hypoxia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels is necessary, and interventions such as increased ventilatory support may be required.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count indicates thrombocytopenia. Close monitoring of bleeding tendencies and appropriate transfusion support should be considered.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit level suggests anemia. Monitoring of symptoms related to anemia and considering transfusion support is important.
5. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient's"

   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, now s/p bronchoscopy with CXR with
   worsening right lope diffuse infiltrate.  Transferred to MICU Green for
   VATS.
   # Right upper lobe mass: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process
 will need to discuss this result
   with the Oncology service.  Will continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.  Currently intubated
   post-procedure
 will hopefully extubate soon.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Discussion with Oncology
   # Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP
   now on day 15.  Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his
   counts have recovered although he remains thrombocytopenic and anemic.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25
   - Continue bactrim for prophylaxis
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime;
   flagyl and azithromycin started [**11-29**].  Blood, sputum, BAL, urine
   cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing includes rapid respiratory
   test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus,
   beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - Can check IgG levels, however, if mass noninfectious, IVIG less of a
   concern
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   # Hypoxia:  New oxygen requirement over past 24 hours.  Likely due to
   pulmonary mass +/- infection.  Pulmonary embolism less of a concern
   given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence to suggest cardiac ischemic
   at this time given negative cardiac enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary
   edema/volume overload on exam.  Currently intubated post-procedure
   will hopefully extubate soon.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   -Continue Lovenox
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   -Continuing diltiazem 30 mg PO QID
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was initially treated with ceftriaxone but has been broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl since November 25th. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient remained febrile and showed dramatic progression of dense right-sided consolidation by CT scan. Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL only revealed gram-positive cocci. The patient is now in the MICU for VATS with biopsy of the right-sided pulmonary process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been febrile despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, indicating a potential ongoing infection. The presence of dense consolidation on CT scan suggests a possible bacterial pneumonia.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, as indicated by hypoxia and the need for intubation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory function is necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low (99), which increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially during invasive procedures such as VATS.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.5 g/dL, indicating anemia. This could contribute to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Coagulopathy: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), previously treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. He was hospitalized in the past for pneumonia while neutropenic and readmitted with a right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate and fever. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and flagyl since November 25th. Despite this, he remains febrile and has shown a dramatic progression of dense right-sided consolidation on CT scan. A flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, revealing only gram-positive cocci. The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with biopsy of the right-sided pulmonary process. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition suggests a severe pulmonary infection, which could progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The persistent fever and worsening lung consolidation indicate a possible ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not addressed promptly.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests suggest potential organ dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Bleeding complications: Given the planned VATS procedure, there is a risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the patient's thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).
5. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The combination of thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer levels, and prolonged clotting times may indicate a potential risk for DIC, a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body.
6. Drug-related adverse effects: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics and anticoagulants, which may have their own side effects and adverse reactions.
7. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, which can further complicate the patient's clinical course.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, laboratory parameters, and overall clinical progress to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, now s/p bronchoscopy with CXR with
   worsening right lope diffuse infiltrate.  Transferred to MICU Green for
   VATS.
   # Right upper lobe mass: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process
 will need to discuss this result
   with the Oncology service.  Will continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.  Currently intubated
   post-procedure
 will hopefully extubate soon.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Discussion with Oncology
   # Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP
   now on day 15.  Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his
   counts have recovered although he remains thrombocytopenic and anemic.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25
   - Continue bactrim for prophylaxis
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime;
   flagyl and azithromycin started [**11-29**].  Blood, sputum, BAL, urine
   cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing includes rapid respiratory
   test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus,
   beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - Can check IgG levels, however, if mass noninfectious, IVIG less of a
   concern
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   # Hypoxia:  New oxygen requirement over past 24 hours.  Likely due to
   pulmonary mass +/- infection.  Pulmonary embolism less of a concern
   given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence to suggest cardiac ischemic
   at this time given negative cardiac enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary
   edema/volume overload on exam.  Currently intubated post-procedure
   will hopefully extubate soon.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   -Continue Lovenox
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   -Continuing diltiazem 30 mg PO QID
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox
   # Hypotension: Resolved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He has been treated with various antibiotics and is currently intubated post-procedure. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Right upper lobe mass: The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with frozen section indicating an infiltrative process. Further discussion with the Oncology service is needed to determine the nature of the mass.

2. Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: The patient is currently on day 15 of his fifth cycle of MR-CHOP chemotherapy. He completed high-dose methotrexate one week prior to admission and remains thrombocytopenic and anemic.

3. Fevers: The patient has been febrile and has been broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime. Additional coverage with flagyl and azithromycin was started on [**11-29**]. Cultures for blood, sputum, BAL, and urine are pending.

4. Hypoxia: The patient developed new oxygen requirements over the past 24 hours, likely due to the pulmonary mass and/or infection. Pulmonary embolism is less of a concern given treatment with lovenox. No evidence of cardiac ischemia or pulmonary edema/volume overload is observed"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, now s/p bronchoscopy with CXR with
   worsening right lope diffuse infiltrate.  Transferred to MICU Green for
   VATS.
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process
 will need to discuss this result
   with the Oncology service.  Will continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.  Currently intubated
   post-procedure
 will hopefully extubate soon.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Discussion with Oncology
   # Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP
   now on day 15.  Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his
   counts have recovered although he remains thrombocytopenic and anemic.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25
   - Continue bactrim for prophylaxis
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime;
   flagyl and azithromycin started [**11-29**].  Blood, sputum, BAL, urine
   cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing includes rapid respiratory
   test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus,
   beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - Can check IgG levels, however, if mass noninfectious, IVIG less of a
   concern
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   # Hypoxia:  New oxygen requirement over past 24 hours.  Likely due to
   pulmonary mass +/- infection.  Pulmonary embolism less of a concern
   given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence to suggest cardiac ischemic
   at this time given negative cardiac enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary
   edema/volume overload on exam.  Currently intubated post-procedure
   will hopefully extubate soon.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   -Continue Lovenox
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   -Continuing diltiazem 30 mg PO QID
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox
   # Hypotension: Resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS: Chest tube in place to
   suction.  The patient was on 5L NC prior to procedure.  Oxygen
   requirement thought due to pulmonary infiltrate/infection.  Pulmonary
   embolism less of a concern given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence
   to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative cardiac
   enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on exam.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2; may be able to extubate today
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process that remains concerning for
   infection.  Will continue to cover broadly for infection in this
   immunocompromised patient.

   # Relative hypotension: Started after initiation of propofol.
   Currently SBP 110-120s.  Unlikely due to sepsis but broadly covering as
   above.
   - Consider change from propofol to fentanyl/versed if hypotensive again
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   - Holding diltiazem for now

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was admitted to the MICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient underwent VATS due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate and was found to have an infiltrative process, concerning for infection. Broad coverage for infection has been initiated.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, right upper lobe infiltrate, fevers, relative hypotension, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and DVT.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Prolonged hypotension and shock due to sepsis or relative hypotension.
2. Respiratory failure due to worsening lung infiltrate or infection.
3. Infection-related complications such as pneumonia, bloodstream infection, or urinary tract infection.
4. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia or anemia.
5. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers due to stress ulcer prophylaxis medications.
8. Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to prolonged NPO status.
9. Glycemic control issues due to stress response or medication effects.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to endotracheal tube colonization.
11. Line-related infections or thrombophlebitis.
12. Catheter-related bloodstream infections.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, laboratory values, and clinical progress to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, now s/p bronchoscopy with CXR with
   worsening right lope diffuse infiltrate.  Transferred to MICU Green for
   VATS.
   # Right upper lobe mass: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process
 will need to discuss this result
   with the Oncology service.  Will continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.  Currently intubated
   post-procedure
 will hopefully extubate soon.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Discussion with Oncology
   # Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP
   now on day 15.  Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his
   counts have recovered although he remains thrombocytopenic and anemic.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25
   - Continue bactrim for prophylaxis
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime;
   flagyl and azithromycin started [**11-29**].  Blood, sputum, BAL, urine
   cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing includes rapid respiratory
   test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus,
   beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - Can check IgG levels, however, if mass noninfectious, IVIG less of a
   concern
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   # Hypoxia:  New oxygen requirement over past 24 hours.  Likely due to
   pulmonary mass +/- infection.  Pulmonary embolism less of a concern
   given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence to suggest cardiac ischemic
   at this time given negative cardiac enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary
   edema/volume overload on exam.  Currently intubated post-procedure
   will hopefully extubate soon.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   -Continue Lovenox
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   -Continuing diltiazem 30 mg PO QID
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox
   # Hypotension: Resolved.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times. He presented with respiratory distress, pneumonia, and anemia. The patient underwent a right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate and fever, despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. A flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed gram-positive cocci (GPC) as the only finding. The patient then underwent right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with wedge resection of the RUL infiltrate. Pathology findings revealed acute organizing pneumonia with many neutrophils, and fungal stain is pending, although the H&E stain was unrevealing.

The patient continues to be hypoxemic and requires supplemental oxygen. His chest tube is draining serosanguinous fluid without air leak. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, azithromycin, and caspofungin. His blood cultures from 11/26/26 showed no growth, while the urine culture was positive for GPC.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 90/52 to 121/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, pneumonia, and anemia. The patient underwent six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy and developed fever and right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered, but the patient's condition did not improve. A flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed only Gram-positive cocci (GPC). The patient then underwent right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with wedge resection on 11/29. Postoperatively, the patient required high levels of oxygen and was not extubated due to high oxygen requirements.

The patient's 24-hour events include receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a hemoglobin concentration of 25%, receiving two 500cc normal saline boluses postoperatively, starting caspofungin per oncology recommendations, and receiving multiple antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 90/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,329 mL, output of 1,540 mL, and a positive balance of 789 mL. The patient is receiving oxygen through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 210 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 24 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 123 mg/dL, calcium of 7.9 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.6 mg/dL, phosphate of 2.6 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) of 15.4 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 36.4 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4.

Radiology findings show a portable chest X-ray indicating significant improvement without clear pneumothorax. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with DLBCL who has been readmitted with RUL infiltrate and fever. Despite broad antibiotic coverage, the patient remains febrile and has shown dramatic progression of dense R-sided consolidation on chest CT. The patient underwent VATS with wedge resection and is now experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's right chest tube is draining serosanguinous fluid, and there are no signs of air leak. The patient's fevers are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was hospitalized for pneumonia. He presented with respiratory distress and was readmitted with right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate and fever. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient remains febrile and has shown dramatic progression of dense right-sided consolidation on chest CT. The patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which only revealed gram-positive cocci (GPC). He then underwent right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with wedge resection. The postoperative course included hypoxemic respiratory failure, and the patient required prolonged mechanical ventilation. The patient's chest tube is draining serosanguinous fluid without air leak. The most recent chest X-ray shows significant improvement with no clear pneumothorax. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and platelets, but low hemoglobin and potassium levels. Other lab results are within normal range. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, caspofungin, and other supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state from chemotherapy and the presence of a chest tube.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen if he does not improve"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU. He underwent six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy and was recently hospitalized for pneumonia. Upon readmission, he presented with a right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate and fever. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient remained febrile and showed a dramatic progression of dense right-sided consolidation on chest CT. A flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, which only revealed gram-positive cocci (GPC). Subsequently, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with biopsy of the right-sided pulmonary process.

   Assessment and Plan
   Please see full note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6837**] for details. Briefly, this is a 60
   y/o man with DLBCL (diagnosed in [**6-25**])  s/p 6 cycles of R-CHOP and
   recent hospitalization for pneumonia in the setting neutropenia who was
   readmitted on [**2126-11-23**] with RUL infiltrate and fever. He has been
   boradly covered for bacterial pathogens but has remained febrile and
   has had dramatic progression of dense right sided consolidation by CT.
   He is s/p flex. bronch with BAL which is notable only for gram positive
   cocci. He is now transferred to MICU 7 from [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in order to facilitate
   VATS with biopsy of right sided pulmonary process. On arrival his
   temperature is 100.3, BP ranging from 80-115/50-60. P 103. He is [**Age over 90 **]% on
   4L NC and has decreased BS as well as dullness to percussion on the
   right. Mentanting well, with warm extremities. I have met with the
   family to explain the transfer and answer questions. I have also
   discussed the case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6837**] and agree with her plan as outlined
   in the admission note. He will go for VATS biopsy this afternoon. He
   remains on broad spectrum abx and will start antifungals post biopsy.
   Prelim report on frozen section path is infiltrative disease. Pending
   final path read, will have more results tomorrow. Will remain on broad
   spectrum antibiotics in the meantime. Have not started antifungals and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who was previously treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. He was hospitalized for pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia and readmitted on 11/23 with right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate and fever. Despite being broadly covered for bacterial pathogens, he remained febrile and had a progression of dense right-sided consolidation on CT. Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed only gram-positive cocci. The patient is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) to facilitate video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with biopsy of the right-sided pulmonary process. On arrival, his temperature is 100.3°F, blood pressure ranges from 80-115/50-60 mmHg, pulse is 103 beats per minute, and he is on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. He has decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the right side, but is maintaining well with warm extremities. The attending physician has discussed the case with the consulting physician and agrees with the plan outlined in the admission note. The patient will undergo VATS biopsy this afternoon, remain on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and start antifungals post-biopsy.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS: Chest tube in place to
   water seal.  The patient was on 5L NC prior to procedure.  Oxygen
   requirement thought due to pulmonary infiltrate/infection.  Pulmonary
   embolism less of a concern given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence
   to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative cardiac
   enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on exam.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2
 patient does not appear ready for extubation
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process that remains concerning for
   infection.  Will continue to cover broadly for infection in this
   immunocompromised patient.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, caspofungin ->
   discuss tailoring treatment with ID and Oncology
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - ID following; appreciate
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime;
   flagyl, azithromycin, and caspofungin started [**11-29**].  Blood, sputum,
   BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing includes rapid
   respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus,
   aspergillus, beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, caspofungin
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - IgG 311, will consult ID re IVIG
   # Relative hypotension: Resolved. Started after initiation of propofol
   and resolved with change to fentanyl/versed. Patient also responded
   well to 2 L  NS [**11-30**]
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP
   now on day 16.  Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his
   counts are recovering.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was admitted to the MICU Green for VATS due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and has a chest tube in place to water seal.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and is on ventilator support. There is an ongoing attempt to wean FiO2, but the patient does not appear ready for extubation.
2. Right upper lobe infiltrate: The patient underwent VATS, and the frozen section indicated an infiltrative process concerning for infection. Broad coverage for infection is being continued.
3. Fevers: The patient has been febrile since admission. Blood, sputum, BAL, and urine cultures are all negative. Other negative testing includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan. Monitoring outstanding cultures/assays is ongoing, and consultation for IVIG is being considered.
4. Relative hypotension: The patient experienced relative hypotension that resolved after initiation of propofol and change to fentanyl/versed. IVF boluses are being given for MAP < 65 and urine output < 50 cc/hr.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS: Chest tube in place to
   suction.  The patient was on 5L NC prior to procedure.  Oxygen
   requirement thought due to pulmonary infiltrate/infection.  Pulmonary
   embolism less of a concern given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence
   to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative cardiac
   enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on exam.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2; may be able to extubate today
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process that remains concerning for
   infection.  Will continue to cover broadly for infection in this
   immunocompromised patient.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, caspofungin ->
   discuss tailoring treatment with ID and Oncology
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - ID following; appreciate
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime;
   flagyl, azithromycin, and caspofungin started [**11-29**].  Blood, sputum,
   BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing includes rapid
   respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus,
   aspergillus, beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, caspofungin
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - Check IgG levels and transfuse IVIG as needed
   # Relative hypotension: Started after initiation of propofol.
   Currently SBP 110-120s.  Unlikely due to sepsis but broadly covering as
   above.
   - Consider change from propofol to fentanyl/versed if hypotensive again
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   - Holding diltiazem for now
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP
   now on day 16.  Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his
   counts are recovering.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   - Holding diltiazem 30 mg PO QID for now due to relative hypotension
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was hospitalized for pneumonia and now presents with a right upper lobe infiltrate and fever. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient remains febrile and has shown rapid progression of dense right-sided consolidation on chest CT. The patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and wedge resection via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The BAL was notable only for gram-positive cocci, and the VATS wedge resection showed acute organizing pneumonitis with numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes, although a fungal stain is pending and the H&E stain was unrevealing. The patient is currently on continuous broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, and caspofungin. The patient's current assessment includes hypoxemic respiratory failure following VATS, right chest tube placement, fevers, and ongoing management of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection, and thromboembolic events."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who has undergone 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy and was recently hospitalized for pneumonia while neutropenic. He was readmitted on [**2126-11-23**] with a right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate and fever. Despite broad antibiotic coverage, the patient remains febrile and has experienced a dramatic progression of dense right-sided consolidation on chest CT. Following flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which only revealed gram-positive cocci (GPC), the patient underwent right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with wedge resection. 

The pathology follow-up shows acute organizing pneumonitis with lots of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), and a fungal stain is pending, although the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is unrevealing. The patient is currently on continuous vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, azithromycin, and caspofungin. 

The patient is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure following VATS, with no evidence of pneumothorax (PTX) on the chest X-ray this morning. The plan is to wean the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) for a goal oxygen saturation (SpO2) >95%. A"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times. The patient's recent hospitalization was due to pneumonia, and he has now developed a right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate and fever. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient remains febrile and has shown rapid progression of dense consolidation in the right lung.

The patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which only showed growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Subsequently, the patient underwent right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection. The preliminary histopathology report indicates an acute organizing pneumonitis with multiple polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), although fungal stains are pending and the initial hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is unrevealing.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure following the VATS procedure. Antibiotics have been changed based on infectious disease (ID) input, and the patient continues to spike fevers despite unremarkable chest X-rays. The patient's oxygen saturation is being weaned for a goal of >95%. Sputum culture has been sent, and the right chest tube has been placed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who underwent 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. The patient presented with fever and right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate that did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection was performed, but the patient remains hypoxemic and requires high-flow oxygen. The frozen section of the lung tissue showed an infectious process, likely infectious.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 91/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 125 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 9.8 L/min.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.3%, platelet count of "

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted to the ICU with a right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate and fever. The patient has been treated with multiple rounds of antibiotics, but remains febrile and has shown a rapid progression of dense consolidation on chest CT. A flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, which only showed growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPC). The patient then underwent a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection, and the preliminary pathology report showed acute organizing pneumonitis with multiple polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), concerning for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). However, fungal stains are still pending.

The patient has experienced recurrent hypotensive episodes temporally related to diltiazem administration and required multiple boluses of intravenous fluids (IVF) with neomycin. Currently, the patient is being ventilated with pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The plan is to slowly wean FiO2 as tolerated, maintaining oxygen saturation (SaO2) >93% and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) >60 mmHg.

The patient's condition is a concern for both an infectious and immunologic process"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS: Chest tube in place to
   water seal.  The patient was on 5L NC prior to procedure.  Oxygen
   requirement thought due to pulmonary infiltrate/infection.  Pulmonary
   embolism less of a concern given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence
   to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative cardiac
   enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on exam.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2
 patient does not appear ready for extubation
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process that remains concerning for
   infection.  Will continue to cover broadly for infection in this
   immunocompromised patient.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, caspofungin ->
   discuss tailoring treatment with ID and Oncology
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - ID following; appreciate
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime;
   flagyl, azithromycin, and caspofungin started [**11-29**].  Blood, sputum,
   BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing includes rapid
   respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus,
   aspergillus, beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, caspofungin
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - IgG 311, will consult ID re IVIG
   # Relative hypotension: Partially related to sedation, but also suspect
   distributive physiology related to lung injury.
   - Neosynephrine for MAP > 65 (history of tachyarrhythmia with levophed)
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP
   now on day 16.  Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his
   counts are recovering.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   - Restarted diltiazem
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS: Chest tube in place to
   water seal.  The patient was on 5L NC prior to procedure.  Oxygen
   requirement thought due to pulmonary infiltrate/infection.  Pulmonary
   embolism less of a concern given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence
   to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative cardiac
   enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on exam.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2
 patient does not appear ready for extubation
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process that remains concerning for
   infection.  Will continue to cover broadly for infection in this
   immunocompromised patient.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, caspofungin ->
   discuss tailoring treatment with ID and Oncology
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - ID following; appreciate
   # Relative hypotension: Partially related to sedation, but also suspect
   distributive physiology related to lung injury.
   - Neosynephrine for MAP > 65 (history of tachyarrhythmia with levophed)
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime;
   flagyl, azithromycin, and caspofungin started [**11-29**].  Blood, sputum,
   BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing includes rapid
   respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus,
   aspergillus, beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, caspofungin
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - IgG 311-> given IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Admitted in his [**5-24**] cycle of MR-CHOP
   now on day 16.  Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his
   counts are recovering.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   - Restarted diltiazem
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirement is thought to be due to a pulmonary infiltrate/infection. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or volume overload on examination.
2. Right upper lobe infiltrate: The patient had a VATS procedure that indicated an infiltrative process, which remains concerning for infection.
3. Fevers: The patient has been febrile and has been broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime. Other negative testing includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan. The source of fever is uncertain and could be related to malignancy or infection.
4. Relative hypotension: The patient has relative hypotension that is partially related to sedation, but also suspect distributive physiology related to lung injury.
5. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: The patient is currently undergoing chemotherapy (MR-CHOP) for his lymphoma.
6. Paroxysmal"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS: Chest tube in place to
   water seal.  The patient was on 5L NC prior to procedure.  Oxygen
   requirement thought due to pulmonary infiltrate/infection.  Pulmonary
   embolism less of a concern given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence
   to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative cardiac
   enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on exam.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2
 patient does not appear ready for extubation
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process
 organizing pneumonia could
   indicated infection versus BOOP.  Will continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, ambisome -> change
   cefepime to meropenem per ID
   - Start Solu-Medrol 125 mg Q6H for question BOOP given negative VATS
   cultures x 48 hours
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - ID following; appreciate
   # Hypotension: Patient appears hypovolemic.  Partially related to
   sedation, but also suspect distributive physiology related to lung
   injury.
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   - Neosynephrine for MAP > 65 (history of tachyarrhythmia with levophed)
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime
   since [**11-25**].  Blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other
   negative testing includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens,
   toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, ambisome -> change
   cefepime to meropenem per ID
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP now
   on day 16.  Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his counts
   are recovering.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   - Restarted diltiazem
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and requires oxygen supplementation. The oxygen requirement is thought to be due to pulmonary infiltrate/infection. Pulmonary embolism is less of a concern given treatment with lovenox. No evidence of cardiac ischemia at this time given negative cardiac enzymes. No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on exam. Attempt to wean FiO2, but the patient does not appear ready for extubation.
2. Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section indicating an infiltrative process, possibly organizing pneumonia or BOOP. Will continue to cover broadly for infection in this immunocompromised patient.

6. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP now on day 16. Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his counts are recovering. Not neutropenic. Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding. Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding. Continue bactrim prophylaxis.
7. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus. Patient has history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers. Restarted diltiazem.
8. DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**]. Continue lovenox.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's head of bed will be elevated, and mouth care will be performed to prevent aspiration.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, and there is a risk of further clot formation. The patient is receiving low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) for DVT prophylaxis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia or distributive physiology related to lung injury. IVF boluses and neosynephrine may be used to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP).
4. Infection: Despite broad coverage with antibiotics, the patient's fevers suggest a possible infection. Monitoring of cultures and ongoing assessment is important.
5. Hypogammaglobulinemia: The patient has hypogammaglobulinemia, and IVIG has"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS: Chest tube in place to
   water seal.  The patient was on 5L NC prior to procedure.  Oxygen
   requirement thought due to pulmonary infiltrate/infection.  Pulmonary
   embolism less of a concern given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence
   to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative cardiac
   enzymes.  No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on exam.

 patient does not appear ready for extubation
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process that remains concerning for
   infection.  Will continue to cover broadly for infection in this
   immunocompromised patient.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, caspofungin ->
   discuss tailoring treatment with ID and Oncology

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He presented with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate, leading to worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient was transferred to the MICU Green for VATS due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate. Currently, he has hypoxic respiratory failure and a chest tube in place to water seal. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medication. He underwent VATS with frozen section indicating an infiltrative process concerning for infection. Blood, sputum, BAL, and urine cultures are pending. The patient's fevers may be due to malignancy versus infection, and he is already being covered for bacterial pathogens. He also has relative hypotension resolved with IVF boluses, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and DVT. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 60% FiO2. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. The patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the MICU Green for VATS due to worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure and underwent VATS with a frozen section indicating an infiltrative process, concerning for infection. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if there is an ongoing infection or if the infiltrative process continues to progress.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state from chemotherapy and the presence of a chest tube.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not properly managed with anticoagulation therapy.
4. Cardiac Ischemia: Although cardiac enzymes are negative, the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypotension raise concerns for possible cardiac ischemia.
5. Pneumonia: The right upper lobe infiltrate could potentially lead to pneumonia if not appropriately treated.
6. Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI): The presence of central lines increases the risk of CRBSI, especially"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has undergone 6 cycles of MR-CHOP chemotherapy. He presented with fever and rapidly progressive right-sided infiltrate. The patient subsequently underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with preliminary pathology results indicating organizing pneumonia. He is now intubated in the operating room and experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood cultures are pending. He has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal therapy. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. His chest X-ray shows significant lung injury, and he is receiving low tidal volume ventilation with slightly higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The differential diagnosis includes infectious causes such as pneumonia versus interstitial lung disease (ILD) like bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or drug-induced pneumonitis. The plan is to continue with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, and if cultures remain negative, a trial of high-dose steroids will be initiated.

The patient also exhibits signs of distributive physiology related to lung injury, which may be contributing to his hypotension. Further plans and assessments are outlined in the resident's note."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypotension: Patient appears hypovolemic.  Partially related to
   sedation, but also suspect distributive physiology related to lung
   injury.
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   - Neosynephrine for MAP > 65 (history of tachyarrhythmia with levophed)
   - Antibiotics as above
   # New Renal Failure: side-effect
   - should check potassium [**Hospital1 **] due to interaction with Solu-Medrol and
   ambisome
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS: Chest tube in place to
   water seal.  The patient was on 5L NC prior to procedure.  Oxygen
   requirement thought due to pulmonary infiltrate/infection.  Pulmonary
   embolism less of a concern given treatment with lovenox.  No evidence
   to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative cardiac
   enzymes.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2
 patient does not appear ready for extubation
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process
 organizing pneumonia could
   indicate infection versus BOOP.  Will continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, ambisome -> change
   cefepime to meropenem per ID
   - Start Solu-Medrol 125 mg Q6H for question BOOP given negative VATS
   cultures x 48 hours
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - ID following; appreciate
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime
   since [**11-25**].  Blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other
   negative testing includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens,
   toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, ambisome -> change
   cefepime to meropenem per ID
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation and
   febrile.  Patient has history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by
   fevers.
   - Restarted diltiazem
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, presenting with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was initially treated at Hospital Unit 44 and then transferred to the MICU Green for VATS due to worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, new renal failure (side effect of medication), hypoxic respiratory failure, and right upper lobe infiltrate. His current medications include vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, ambisome, and recently added meropenem and Solu-Medrol. 

The patient's vital signs show fever, low blood pressure, tachycardia, and increased respiratory rate. His laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The assessment and plan include addressing the patient's hypotension, new renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, right upper lobe infiltrate, fevers, hypogammaglobulinemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and deep vein thrombosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates potential hypotension, which could be related to hypovolemia, sedation, or distributive physiology due to lung injury. IVF"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure and has developed a fever. The patient has been started on Solu-Medrol, which is a corticosteroid, and the antibiotic meropenem for suspected Nocardia coverage. The patient's blood pressure dropped to the systolic 60s despite maximum Neo (norepinephrine) at 18:00, leading to the initiation of IV fluid bolus and addition of vasopressin. A large right-sided pneumothorax was observed on chest X-ray, and a chest tube was placed and changed from water seal to suction.

The patient also converted to atrial fibrillation without rapid ventricular response and the Neo dosage is being titrated down. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were azithromycin, caspofungin, cefepime, vancomycin, metronidazole, and ambisome.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions including fentanyl, phenylephrine, vasopressin, and midazolam (Versed). Other ICU medications include fentanyl and midazolam. The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged from admission, except for the new development of respiratory failure.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged except for the presence of pain. The patient appears comfortable. The flowsheet data shows vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen"

   advanced 2-4 cm.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypotension: Patient appears euvolemic to hypervolemic. Hypotension
   attributed toPNEUMOTHORAX, but also related to distributive physiology
   due to lung injury and sedation  Need to investigate pericardium and
   cardiac output
   - No IVFs, I/O goal even
   - Neosynephrine for MAP = 60-65 (history of tachyarrhythmia with
   levophed)
   - Chest tube to suction
   - TTE to r/o pericardial effusion
   - CvO2
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS/ PNEUMOTHORAX: Chest
   tube in place was initially to suction, and on water seal [**12-2**] and in
   setting of increasing PEEP for ventilation the patient developed a
   pneumothorax. Chest tube now to suction with leak. Feel respiratory
   failure due to right lobe infiltrate, no evidence cardiac ischemia and
   think PE unlikely given patient has been on lovenox.
   - Wean PEEP
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - CXR repeat today to eval progression/regression of pneumothorax
   - Cont abx, steroids as below, push path for diagnosis
   # New Renal Failure: concerned medication side-effect, but given
   hypotension, fevers needs antibiotics at this time. Consider may be RTA
   given non-gap acidosis by ABG/chem7
   - renal lytes inc eos
   - [**Hospital1 **] potassium (interaction with Solu-Medrol and ambisome)
   - check vancomycin level
   - renally dose medications
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process
 organizing pneumonia could
   indicate infection versus BOOP.  Will continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, ambisome -> change
   cefepime to meropenem per ID
   - Start Solu-Medrol 125 mg Q6H for question BOOP given negative VATS
   cultures x 48 hours
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
 call path to try to expidite diagnosis
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - ID following; appreciate
   # Fevers: Most likely due to malignancy versus infection.  Has been
   broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime
   since [**11-25**].  Blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other
   negative testing includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens,
   toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, ambisome,  meropenem per
   ID
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - Awaiting VATS pathology
 call path to try to expidite diagnosis
   - CIS > 101.5F
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation due
   to nodal blocking by neo.  Patient has history of atrial fibrillation
   precipitated by fevers.
   - off diltaizem given hypotension
   - only treat if impacts hemodynamics
   - try to wean neo
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, presenting with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, new renal failure, right upper lobe infiltrate, fevers, and hypogammaglobulinemia. He is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with MR-CHOP chemotherapy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to pneumothorax or worsening right lobe infiltrate, worsening hypotension leading to shock, worsening renal failure requiring dialysis, and potential infections such as pneumonia or bloodstream infection. 

Further diagnostic tests and interventions are planned to determine the underlying cause of the patient's condition, including VATS pathology, repeat chest X-ray, TTE to rule out pericardial effusion, and monitoring outstanding cultures/assays."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with DLBCL,  hypoxemic respiratory failure, fevers and
   now apparent tension pneumothorax. Persistent air leak after
   repositioning of chest tube and improving
   hemodynamics. Will leave chest tube to suction, appreciate thoracis
   assistance. Will attempt to minimize airway pressure (though may be
   limited by oxygentaion). Ideally would like PEEP
   no higher than 5. He appears clinicaly to be volume resuscitated. We
   will check Cv02 and TTE echo today to complete the w/u of hypotension.
   On neo [**1-19**] to tachyarrythmia on
   levophed and will titrate for MAP 60-65. Started on solumedrol
   yesterday + broad empiric abx and antifungals, still awaiting final
   path. Cr is slowly climbing despite fluid resuscitation yesterday,
   concern for med effect but will just monitor for now given need for
   antimicrobials. [**Hospital1 **] lytes.  Further plans as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presented with fever, rapidly progressive right-sided consolidation despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. He underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with preliminary pathology showing organizing pneumonia. The patient is currently on broad empiric antibiotics as well as ambisome, and started on high-dose steroids yesterday.

The patient experienced hypotension overnight and required chest tube placement due to tension pneumothorax. The tension pneumothorax resolved with tube to suction and repositioning, but a new air leak developed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, phenylephrine, vasopressin, midazolam, and others. His lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels.

The assessment and plan state that the patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure, fevers, and tension pneumothorax. The chest tube will be left to suction, and efforts will be made to minimize airway pressure. Ideally, PEEP should be no higher than 5. The patient appears to be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with fever, rapidly progressive right-sided consolidation, and an organizing pneumonia on preliminary pathology. He has been treated with multiple cycles of MR-CHOP chemotherapy. The patient has developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax, and persistent air leak after chest tube placement. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and high-dose steroids. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60/43-138/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is sedated and has atrial fibrillation. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, fevers, tension pneumothorax, and persistent air leak. The plan includes leaving the chest tube to suction, minimizing airway pressure, and gradually reducing PEEP to 5. The patient will be monitored for cardiac function, and more normal saline will be given for septic physiology with normal cardiac function.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating organizing differential remains infection vs immune. Will
   continue to cover broadly for infection in this immunocompromised
   patient.  Pathology on VAT was negative for any fungus
   - Stop ambisome, esp given rising Cr
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, meropenem for empiric 14

   # Renal Failure: concerned medication side-effect most likely ambisome.
   Given negative fungal pathology and glucan/glactommannan, stop
   ambisome, Urine eos negative
   - check vancomycin level
   - renally dose medications
   - I/O even to neg for CVP 4 given desire to run lungs dry with
   oxygenation issue.
   # Hypotension: Patient does not appear intravascularly hypervolemic. On
   small pressor requirement, on sedation. Think hypotension at this point
   sedation and small component decreased SVR from lung injury. Do not
   feel add
l fluid will be helpful. ECHO no pericardial effusion
   - No IVFs, I/O goal even to neg with CVP 4
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to suction - no leak
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS/ PNEUMOTHORAX: Chest
   tube in place was initially to suction, and on water seal [**12-2**] and in
   setting of increasing PEEP for ventilation the patient developed a
   pneumothorax. Chest tube now to suction without leak. Feel respiratory
   failure due to right lobe infiltrate vs volume, no evidence cardiac
   ischemia and think PE unlikely given patient has been on lovenox.
   - PEEP at 5, wean FiO2 to 40% if able
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - CT chest non-con to eval PTX which appears to have resolved
   - Cont abx, steroids as above
   - trial I/O even to neg with CVP of 4
   # Fevers: Afebrile O/N, but now on steroids.  Has been broadly covered
   for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime since [**11-25**].
   Blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and undergone various interventions including placement of a CVL, chest tube insertion, and administration of multiple antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to right lobe infiltrate and/or pneumothorax. The chest tube has been placed to suction without leak.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of renal failure, possibly caused by medication side effects, particularly Ambisome. The creatinine level has been rising, and the patient's urine eosinophils are negative.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires small amounts of pressor support. This is attributed to sedation and decreased systemic vascular resistance from lung injury. Fluid administration is not expected to be helpful, and the focus is on weaning off levophed and sedation.

4. Infection: The patient has been broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime since November 25th. Blood, sputum, BAL, and urine cultures have all been negative to date. Other negative testing includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillus,"

   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypotension: Patient appears euvolemic to hypervolemic. Hypotension
   attributed toPNEUMOTHORAX, but also related to distributive physiology
   due to lung injury and sedation  Need to investigate pericardium and
   cardiac output. ECHO no pericardial effusion
   - No IVFs, I/O goal even
   - On Levophed, because of bradycardia with neo and vasopressin

   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating an infiltrative process
 organizing pneumonia could
   indicate infection versus BOOP.  Will continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, ambisome -> change
   cefepime to meropenem per ID
   - Start Solu-Medrol 125 mg Q6H for question BOOP given negative VATS

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient appears euvolemic to hypervolemic and hypotension is attributed to pneumothorax, but also related to distributive physiology due to lung injury and sedation. The patient is on Levophed because of bradycardia with neo and vasopressin.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient developed a pneumothorax after the chest tube was placed on water seal, which resulted in worsening respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP.

3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pneumothorax that was initially managed with a chest tube to suction. However, the patient developed a pneumothorax again after increasing PEEP for ventilation. The chest tube is now to suction with leak.

4. Right upper lobe infiltrate: The patient has an infiltrate in the right upper lobe, which is status post VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery). The frozen section indicates an infiltrative process, possibly organizing pneumonia or BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia).

5. New renal failure: The patient has developed new renal failure, which is suspected to be due to medication side effects, but could also be due to hypotension and sepsis. The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, including eosinophilia and non-gap acidosis.

6. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which are likely due to malignancy or infection. The patient has been broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with antibiotics, but other causes of fevers are still being investigated.

7. Hypogammaglobulinemia: The patient has low levels of IgG, indicating hypogammaglobulinemia. The patient has received IVIG recently.

8. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: The patient has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and has completed 5 cycles of MR-CHOP chemotherapy. The patient's disease status is currently unknown.

9. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation due to nodal blocking by neo. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.

10. DVT: The patient has a history of diagnosed DVT on [**11/20XX**]. The patient's anticoagulation therapy with lovenox is currently held due to anticipation of thoracic surgical interventions given pneumothorax.

These are the potential medical complications based on the provided progress note."

   60 year old man with PMH DLBCL, hypoxemic respiratory failure and now
   ARF. Pathology from RUL infiltrate is inconclusive so will continue
   broad spectrum antibiotics and steroids for now. With negative serology
   and stains, fungal infection seems increasingly unlikely. Would like
   to DC ambisome today (particularly in light of ARF). Continues with low
   level pressor requirement but on sig. sedation. CVP running somewhat
   low but  SVV wnl,
   vascular pedicle width ~70mm on , grossly anasarcic on exam so doubt
   utility of additional volume. Oxygenation remains an issue, would
   continue low tidal volume ventilation
   and minmize PEEP ([**1-19**] pneumothorax). Aim TBB even to slightly negative
   today with goal CVP 4-6. Repeat chest CT today. Today is day 3 of 125
   q6hrs of solumedrol,
   will switch to 60mg prednisone in the morning. Further plans as per
   resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a medical history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure and a rapidly progressive right-sided infiltrate. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, and antifungal treatment. Despite these interventions, the patient's condition remains critical, and he continues to have low oxygenation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 127/57 mmHg to 152/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and a SpO2 of 97%. The patient is sedated and not fully assessed neurologically.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.7 x 10^9/L, elevated creatinine levels, and mildly abnormal liver function tests. The patient's platelet count is within normal range. Imaging reveals right upper lobe infiltrate and small bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.34"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure and a rapidly progressive right-sided infiltrate. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics and steroids.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, and blood pressure is maintained. Respiratory rate is slightly elevated, but oxygen saturation is good.

The physical examination reveals rhonchorous breath sounds in the respiratory/chest assessment. Cardiovascular, abdominal, extremities, and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. 

Laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels. Other lab values, such as leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver function tests, are within normal limits. Imaging shows a persistent right upper lobe infiltrate and small bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's condition requires ongoing management in the ICU with continued low-level pressor requirements, sedation, and mechanical ventilation. The medical team plans to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, and discuss discontinuation of Ambisome due to acute renal failure. They aim to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) between 4-6, repeat a chest CT, and monitor the patient closely.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of kidney injury, infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating organizing differential remains infection vs immune. Will
   continue to cover broadly for infection in this immunocompromised
   patient.  Pathology on VAT was negative for any fungus
   - Stop ambisome, esp given rising Cr
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, meropenem for empiric 14
   day course
   - On Solu-Medrol 125 mg Q6H --- day 3 today, convert to prednisone 60
   mg in am
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - ID following; appreciate
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS/ PNEUMOTHORAX: Chest
   tube in place was initially to suction, and on water seal [**12-2**] and in
   setting of increasing PEEP for ventilation the patient developed a
   pneumothorax. Chest tube now to suction without leak. Feel respiratory
   failure due to right lobe infiltrate vs volume, no evidence cardiac
   ischemia and think PE unlikely given patient has been on lovenox.
   - PEEP at 5, wean FiO2 to 40% if able
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - CT chest non-con to eval PTX which appears to have resolved
   - Cont abx, steroids as above
   - trial I/O even to neg with CVP of 4
   # Acute renal failure: concerned medication side-effect most likely
   ambisome. Given negative fungal pathology and glucan/glactommannan,
   stop ambisome, Urine eos negative
   - check vancomycin level
   - renally dose medications
   - I/O even to neg for CVP 4 given desire to run lungs dry with
   oxygenation issue.
   # Pancytopenia:
   # Hypotension: Patient does not appear intravascularly hypervolemic. On
   small pressor requirement, on sedation. Think hypotension at this point
   sedation and small component decreased SVR from lung injury. Do not
   feel add
l fluid will be helpful. ECHO no pericardial effusion
   - No IVFs, I/O goal even to neg with CVP 4
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to suction - no leak
   # Fevers: Afebrile O/N, but now on steroids.  Has been broadly covered
   for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime since [**11-25**].
   Blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, meropenem for empiric
   course
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - CIS > 101.5F
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   - Off diltaizem given hypotension
   - Only treat if impacts hemodynamics
   - Wean levophed if able
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the ICU due to worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension.

2. The patient underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) and the frozen section indicated organizing differential remains infection vs immune. Broad coverage for infection is being continued in this immunocompromised patient, with a focus on fungal infections due to his lymphoma treatment.

3. The patient developed a pneumothorax during chest tube placement and was managed accordingly. There is no evidence of cardiac ischemia or pulmonary embolism.

4. The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to medication side effects, specifically ambisome. Ambisome has been stopped and other medications have been adjusted to account for the patient's renal failure.

5. The patient also has pancytopenia, hypotension, and fevers. The fevers are being monitored, and cultures are pending. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

6. The patient has a history of hypogammaglobulinemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (treated with MR-CHOP), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (C"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: Now status post VATS with frozen section
   indicating organizing differential remains infection vs immune. Will
   continue to cover broadly for infection in this immunocompromised
   patient.  Pathology on VAT was negative for any fungus
   - Stop ambisome, esp given rising Cr
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, meropenem for empiric 14
   day course
   - On Solu-Medrol 125 mg Q6H --- day 3 today, convert to prednisone 60
   mg in am
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - ID following; appreciate
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/status post VATS/ PNEUMOTHORAX: Chest
   tube in place was initially to suction, and on water seal [**12-2**] and in
   setting of increasing PEEP for ventilation the patient developed a
   pneumothorax. Chest tube now to suction without leak. Feel respiratory
   failure due to right lobe infiltrate vs volume, no evidence cardiac
   ischemia and think PE unlikely given patient has been on lovenox.
   - PEEP at 5, wean FiO2 to 40% if able
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - CT chest non-con to eval PTX which appears to have resolved
   - Cont abx, steroids as above
   - trial I/O even to neg with CVP of 4
   # Acute renal failure: concerned medication side-effect most likely
   ambisome. Given negative fungal pathology and glucan/glactommannan,
   stop ambisome, Urine eos negative
   - check vancomycin level
   - renally dose medications
   - I/O even to neg for CVP 4 given desire to run lungs dry with
   oxygenation issue.
   # Pancytopenia:
   # Hypotension: Patient does not appear intravascularly hypervolemic. On
   small pressor requirement, on sedation. Think hypotension at this point
   sedation and small component decreased SVR from lung injury. Do not
   feel add
l fluid will be helpful. ECHO no pericardial effusion
   - No IVFs, I/O goal even to neg with CVP 4
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to suction - no leak
   # Fevers: Afebrile O/N, but now on steroids.  Has been broadly covered
   for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime since [**11-25**].
   Blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan.
   - Continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, meropenem for empiric
   course
   - Monitor outstanding cultures/assays
 coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides
   - CIS > 101.5F
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   - Off diltaizem given hypotension
   - Only treat if impacts hemodynamics
   - Wean levophed if able
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He has been admitted to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate, with frozen section indicating organizing differential remains infection vs immune. 

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy (Vt set at 450 mL), and the PEEP is at 5 cmH2O. The FiO2 is weaned to 40%. There are no signs of cardiac ischemia, and pulmonary embolism (PE) is considered unlikely due to ongoing lovenox prophylaxis.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient developed a pneumothorax while on increasing PEEP for ventilation. The chest tube is currently to suction without leak, and the pneumothorax appears to have resolved. A CT chest will be performed to evaluate the situation further.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, possibly due to medication side effects, particularly ambisome. The ambisome has been stopped, and the vancomycin level will be checked. Renal dosing of medications will be done, and the patient's"

   # Pancytopenia: Likely medication effect given timing.  Unlikely due to
   marrow suppression from infection with cultures all negative.  Low
   probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but will evaluate.
   - Discontinue vancomycin and voriconazole as above
   - Send HIT antibodies
   - Monitor for neutropenia
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with respiratory failure and dense right-sided consolidation. He underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and the pathology showed organizing pneumonia. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antimicrobials and high-dose steroids. 

On 24-hour events, the patient's Ambisome was changed to voriconazole, and Solumedrol was changed to prednisone. Antibiotics were re-dosed for renal failure. A CT scan revealed a small residual right pneumothorax and improving right consolidation. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were cefipime, ambisome, voriconazole, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin. 

The patient is receiving infusions of norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam (Versed). He is also on other ICU medications such as furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and enoxaparin (Lovenox). 

On the flow sheet, the patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, a current temperature of 35.5 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 119/56 to 76 mmHg"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: CT chest yesterday showed improvement in
   infiltrate.  VATS pathology unrevealing for etiology, however, cultures
   negative for fungus.  Patient completed a ten-day course of vancomycin
   and will discontinue
 will otherwise continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.   Patient s/p 10 day
   vancomycin course, vancomycin stopped [**12-5**]. Voriconazole was
   discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no fungal culture growth.
   - Discontinue cipro/flagyl today
   - Continue meropenem for now
   - Continue prednisone 60 mg x 3 days, then taper
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax: CT chest yesterday showed
   very small pneumothorax, improvement in right infiltrate, left lower
   lobe collapse.  Chest tube now to suction without leak.  Feel
   respiratory failure due to right lobe infiltrate versus volume.  Left
   lower lobe collapse likely due to mucus plugging.  No evidence of
   cardiac ischemia and think pulmonary embolus unlikely given patient has
   been on therapeutic lovenox.
   - Continue ventilator at current settings
 improving P/F
   - Stop VERSED, if agitation start propofol in anticipation of improving
   pulm function and attempts to wean from vent
   - Continue chest tube to WATER SEAL, CXR 10:30AM
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - Goal negative 500cc-1L today on lasix drip
   - Continue antibiotics and steroids as above
   #  Hypernatremia: in setting of intermittent tube feeds due to high
   residuals, and diuresis
   - continue diuresis
   - free water boluses, will tolerate slightly higher residuals (>150-175
   ml) if do not progressively increase
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Likely medication effect and ambisome most
   likely culprit.  Stable/decreased despite diuresis.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Off ambisome
   # Pancytopenia: Likely medication effect given timing, recovered in
   setting of stopping ambisome.  Unlikely due to marrow suppression from
   infection with cultures all negative.  Low probability of
   heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but will evaluate.
   - Send HIT antibodies
   - Monitor for neutropenia
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding
   # Hypotension: Improved despite diuresis.  Also likely component of
   sedation and pneumothorax.
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to water seal, following CXRs
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 48 hours, however, on steroids.  Has been broadly
   covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus.  VATS,
   blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan, coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides. Vancomycin, voriconazole [**12-5**].
   - Discontinue ciprofloxacin, flagyl
   - Continue meropenem
   - CIS > 100.5
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   - Off diltiazem given hypotension
   - Only treat if impacts hemodynamics
   - Wean levophed
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the MICU Green for VATS due to worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient completed a ten-day course of vancomycin and will discontinue it. Voriconazole was also discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no fungal culture growth. 

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, hypotension, and fevers. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Right upper lobe infiltrate: Continue to monitor and improve infiltrate. VATS pathology unrevealing for etiology, however, cultures negative for fungus.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax: Continue ventilator at current settings. Stop VERSED, if agitation start propofol in anticipation of improving pulm function and attempts to wean from vent.
3. Hypernatremia: Continue diuresis. Free water boluses, will tolerate slightly higher residuals (>150-175 ml) if do not progressively increase.
4. Acute renal failure: Renally dose medications. Off ambisome.
5. Pancytopenia: Likely medication effect given timing, recovered in setting of stopping ambisome.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: CT chest yesterday showed improvement in
   infiltrate.  VATS pathology unrevealing for etiology, however, cultures
   negative for fungus.  Patient completed a ten-day course of vancomycin
   and will discontinue
 will otherwise continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.   Patient s/p 10 day
   vancomycin course, vancomycin stopped [**12-5**]. Voriconazole was
   discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no fungal culture growth.
   - Discontinue cipro/flagyl today
   - Continue meropenem for now
   - Continue prednisone 60 mg x 3 days, then taper
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax: CT chest yesterday showed
   very small pneumothorax, improvement in right infiltrate, left lower
   lobe collapse.  Chest tube now to suction without leak.  Feel
   respiratory failure due to right lobe infiltrate versus volume.  Left
   lower lobe collapse likely due to mucus plugging.  No evidence of
   cardiac ischemia and think pulmonary embolus unlikely given patient has
   been on therapeutic lovenox.
   - Continue ventilator at current settings
   - Continue chest tube to WATER SEAL, CXR 10:30AM
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - Goal negative 500cc-1L today
   - Continue antibiotics and steroids as above
   # Acute renal failure: Likely medication effect and ambisome most
   likely culprit.  Stable/decreased despite diuresis.
   - Renally dose medications
   # Pancytopenia: Likely medication effect given timing.  Unlikely due to
   marrow suppression from infection with cultures all negative.  Low
   probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but will evaluate.
   - Discontinue vancomycin and voriconazole as above
   - Send HIT antibodies
   - Monitor for neutropenia
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding
   # Hypotension: Improved despite diuresis.  Also likely component of
   sedation and pneumothorax.
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to suction
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 48 hours, however, on steroids.  Has been broadly
   covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus.  VATS,
   blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan, coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides.
   - Discontinue vancomycin and voriconazole
   - Continue meropenem, ciprofloxacin, flagyl for now
   - CIS > 100.5
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus.  Patient has
   history of atrial fibrillation precipitated by fevers.
   - Off diltiazem given hypotension
   - Only treat if impacts hemodynamics
   - Wean levophed
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the MICU Green for VATS due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate. The patient completed a ten-day course of vancomycin and will discontinue it. Voriconazole was also discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no fungal culture growth. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, hypotension, fevers, hypogammaglobulinemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to the right lobe infiltrate or volume issues. Left lower lobe collapse is likely due to mucus plugging. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his chest tube is to water seal. Monitoring for improvement in the right infiltrate and left lower lobe collapse is essential.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and it is likely due to medication effects, particularly Ambisome. Renal dosing of medications is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 60-year-old man with DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure and rapidly progressive dense right-sided pulmonary infiltrate.
- Patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for more than 10 days, so Cipro and Flagyl will be discontinued today.
- Assessment: Hypoxemic respiratory failure of infectious vs. inflammatory origin, with a dense right-sided infiltrate.
- Plan: Continue gentle diuresis today, minimize sedation, and consider using propofol for sedation if needed.
- Prednisone will be continued at 60 mg/day for possible BOOP (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia).
- No clinical tension observed in the chest tube, so it will be left on waterseal.
- CXR will be checked in a few hours.
- ICU care includes nutrition via tube feeds, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines (PICC line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line), prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), and code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining head-of-bed elevation, providing adequate mouth care, and ensuring daily wake-up trials.
2. Deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure and a rapidly progressive, dense right-sided pulmonary infiltrate. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for over 10 days. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2 of 205 mmHg, and HCO3- of 81 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals absent breath sounds at the left base, no leak from the chest tube, soft and non-tender abdomen, and 2+ peripheral edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be sedated with no assessed tone, movement, or response to stimuli. Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 193 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation overnight with
   hypotension.  Likely med effect.
   - Cont levophed and add vasopressin to support pressures while on
   sedation
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: CT chest yesterday showed improvement in
   infiltrate.  VATS pathology unrevealing for etiology, however, cultures
   negative for fungus.  Patient completed a ten-day course of vancomycin
   and will discontinue
 will otherwise continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.   Patient s/p 10 day
   vancomycin course, vancomycin stopped [**12-5**]. Voriconazole was
   discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no fungal culture growth.
   Of cipro/ flagyl [**2126-12-6**].
   - Continue meropenem for now
   - Continue prednisone 60 mg x 3 days, then taper
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax: CT chest yesterday showed
   very small pneumothorax, improvement in right infiltrate, left lower
   lobe collapse.  Chest tube now to suction without leak.  Feel
   respiratory failure due to right lobe infiltrate versus volume.  Left
   lower lobe collapse likely due to mucus plugging.  No evidence of
   cardiac ischemia and think pulmonary embolus unlikely given patient has
   been on therapeutic lovenox. On propofol and off versed.
   - Continue ventilator at current settings
 P/F <200
   - Continue chest tube to suction given events of afib O/N
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - Goal negative 500cc-1L today on lasix drip
   - Continue antibiotics and steroids as above
   #  Hypernatremia: in setting of intermittent tube feeds due to high
   residuals, and diuresis
   - continue diuresis
   - free water boluses, will tolerate slightly higher residuals (>150-175
   ml) if do not progressively increase
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Likely medication effect and improved
   with discontinuation of ambisome.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Off ambisome
   # Pancytopenia: Likely medication effect given timing, recovered in
   setting of stopping ambisome.  Unlikely due to marrow suppression from
   infection with cultures all negative.  Low probability of
   heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but will evaluate.
   - Send HIT antibodies
   - Monitor for neutropenia
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding
   # Hypotension: Improved despite diuresis.  Also likely component of
   sedation and pneumothorax.
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to water seal, following CXRs
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 48 hours, however, on steroids.  Has been broadly
   covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus.  VATS,
   blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan, coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides. Vancomycin, voriconazole [**12-5**].
   - Discontinue ciprofloxacin, flagyl
   - Continue meropenem
   - CIS > 100.5
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who presented with respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. They have been experiencing various medical complications, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), hemodynamic instability, and pneumonia. The patient has also shown signs of fever of unknown origin (FUO), hypotension, and possible hospital-acquired conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which is a critical condition where the lungs are unable to provide sufficient oxygen to the body. This can be caused by various factors, including pneumonia, which the patient is currently dealing with.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR and Hemodynamic Instability: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with RVR, leading to hemodynamic instability. This means that the heart's normal rhythm is disrupted, causing an irregular and often rapid heartbeat. This condition can result in inadequate blood flow to the body's organs and tissues.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection in one or both lungs. Symptoms include cough, fever, difficulty breathing, and chest pain. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.

4. Hospital-Acquired Conditions: There is a possibility of hospital-acquired conditions due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU. These conditions can include infections or complications resulting from medical procedures.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation overnight with
   hypotension.  Likely med effect.
   - Trialed neo, but pt too brady, loaded amio, patient to cont on
   levophed
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
   - Discontinue diltiazem
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: CT chest yesterday showed improvement in
   infiltrate.  VATS pathology unrevealing for etiology, however, cultures
   negative for fungus.  Patient completed a ten-day course of vancomycin
   and will discontinue
 will otherwise continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.   Patient s/p 10 day
   vancomycin course, vancomycin stopped [**12-5**]. Voriconazole was
   discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no fungal culture growth.
   Of cipro/ flagyl [**2126-12-6**].
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Continue prednisone 60 mg for at least one month concerned for BOOP
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax: CT chest yesterday showed
   very small pneumothorax, improvement in right infiltrate, left lower
   lobe collapse.  Chest tube now to suction without leak.  Feel
   respiratory failure due to right lobe infiltrate versus volume.  Left
   lower lobe collapse likely due to mucus plugging.  No evidence of
   cardiac ischemia and think pulmonary embolus unlikely given patient has
   been on therapeutic lovenox. On propofol and off versed.
   - Continue ventilator at current settings
 P/F <200, wean FiO2
   - Continue chest tube to water seal, recheck CXR
   - Fentanyl patch for chest tube pain to allow iv fentanyl to be removed
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - Goal negative 500cc-1L today on lasix drip
   - Continue antibiotics and steroids as above
   #  Hypernatremia: in setting of intermittent tube feeds due to high
   residuals, and diuresis
   - continue diuresis
   - free water boluses, will tolerate slightly higher residuals (>150-175
   ml) if do not progressively increase
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Likely medication effect and improved
   with discontinuation of ambisome.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Off ambisome
   # Pancytopenia-
 Leukocytosis: Pancytopenia felt to be medication
   effect given timing, recovered in setting of stopping ambisome.  New
   leukocytosis concerning for infection, although remains stable
   - Cont meropenem
   - Re-culture
 stool, urine, blood
   - Sent HIT antibodies
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the MICU Green for VATS due to worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, right upper lobe infiltrate, hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, hypotension, fevers, hypogammaglobulinemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and DVT. The patient has completed a ten-day course of vancomycin and voriconazole was discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no fungal culture growth. He is currently on meropenem to complete a 14-day course, prednisone 60 mg for at least one month concerned for BOOP, and continues to cover broadly for infection in this immunocompromised patient. The patient's condition remains stable, but several complications and conditions need to be monitored and managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year man with B cell lymphoma on RCHOP with severe PNA s/p VATS c/b
   PTX with persistent  hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   1. Resp Failure: in setting of severe PNA and now s/p VATS with PTX -
   Oxygenation is stable, but have not been able to make sig progress with
   PTX and sedation and AFib with RVR confounding picture. Chest tube to
   water seal today.
   2. Afib: went back into afib overnight with RVR and hypotension and s/p
   cardioversion which briefly slowed but then recurred so has been IV
   Amio loaded and is now on a continuous drip.
   3. Hemodynamics: Would favor low dose neo with goal MAP 60-  CVP
   running [**2-21**] with good urine output and minimal  pressors (on sedation).
   Would aim even to -500 today.
   4. Leukocytosis: dramatic rise today, but has not been febrile. Will
   pan culture. Appreciate ID follow up.
   Remaining issues as per HOusestaff notes.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who has been admitted to the MICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has dense right-sided consolidation and negative cultures. A VATS biopsy showed organizing pneumonia, for which he is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and empiric steroids. The patient developed tension pneumothorax post-VATS, which responded to chest tube repositioning. He also experienced recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) while on levophed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 127 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/74 to 138/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus tachycardia as his heart rhythm.

The patient has been on various infusions including fentanyl, diltiazem, norepinephrine, and propofol. He is also receiving metoprolol and diltiazem. His flow sheet data shows a balance of 356 mL of fluids in and out, with a total input of 4,221 mL and a total output of 3,865 mL.

His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation with assist and autoflow modes, set tidal volume (V"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year man with PMH as above who presents with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure. Plan as per resident note. Briefly, afib overnight and s/p
   cardioversion
   . Now in SR. DC diltiazem and levophed today. Would favor low dose neo
   if still needs a pressor and start amio for recurrent afib.
    CVP running [**2-21**] with good urine output and minimal  pressors (on
   sedation). Would aim even to -500 today.  Oxygenation is improving, as
   sedation is lightened will try to transition to pressure support. Chest
   tube to water seal today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted to the MICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and the biopsy showed organizing pneumonia. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and empiric steroids.

The patient's recent events include unstable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which was managed with cardioversion overnight. He also developed a tension pneumothorax post-VATS, which responded to chest tube repositioning.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C
- Heart rate: 127 bpm
- Blood pressure: 131/74 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Current rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient is receiving several medications, including fentanyl, diltiazem, norepinephrine, propofol, metoprolol, and others. He is also receiving tube feeds and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's lab results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, electrolytes, and kidney function. However, his blood glucose levels are elevated.

The patient's plan includes continuing with broad-spectrum antibiotics and empiric steroids,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He has been transferred to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient underwent VATS due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.

The patient also has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, right upper lobe infiltrate, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, hypotension, fevers, hypogammaglobulinemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumothorax. There is a potential risk of further respiratory failure if the patient's lung condition worsens.
2. Infection: The patient has been on numerous antibiotics and is currently on meropenem. There is a potential risk of developing antibiotic resistance or an allergic reaction to the antibiotics.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with hypotension, but no evidence of cardiac ischemia was found. However, there is still a potential risk of cardiac ischemia due to the patient's underlying conditions.
4. Pulmonary Embolism"

   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax:
   Improving.  Status post VATS [**11-29**] without definitive pathology
 chest
   tube remains in place.  Right upper lobe infiltrate improving on
   steroids started [**12-2**].  Has been on numerous antibiotics and is
   currently on meropenem to complete a 14-day course started [**12-2**].  Left
   lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging
 restarted
   vancomycin [**12-7**].  Antifungals discontinued due to negative fungal
   stain and no fungal culture growth. No evidence of cardiac ischemia and
   pulmonary embolus unlikely given patient has been on therapeutic
   lovenox.
   - Change ventilator to pressure support as tolerated
   - Continue chest tube to water seal
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Discontinue vancomycin if negative cultures x 48 hours
   - Continue prednisone 60 mg daily for at least one month as concerned
   for BOOP
   - Lasix today for goal -500-1L
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - Fentanyl patch for chest tube pain and haldol for agitation;
   discontinue fentanyl gtt
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation overnight with
   hypotension.
   - Trialed neosynephrine, but patient became too bradycardic -> loaded
   amiodarone, patient to continue on levophed
   - Start amiodorone PO
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
   # Acute renal failure: Improved. Likely medication effect and improved
   with discontinuation of ambisome.
   - Renally dose medications
   # Pancytopenia/Leukocytosis: Pancytopenia felt to be medication effect
   given timing, recovered in setting of stopping ambisome.  New
   leukocytosis concerning for infection, although remains stable.
   Hematocrit stable.  Platelets improved.
   - Continue meropenem
   - Discontinue vancomycin if negative cultures x 48 hours
   - Pan-cultured
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 72 hours, however, on steroids.  Has been broadly
   covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus.  VATS,
   blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan, coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides.
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Discontinue vancomycin if negatiave cultures x 48 hours
   - Check CT abdomen for question abdominal tenderness
   - CIS > 100.5
   # Hypotension: Improved despite diuresis.  Also likely component of
   sedation and pneumothorax.
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to water seal, following CXRs
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - Decrease free water boluses
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Currently not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the MICU Green for VATS due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, right upper lobe infiltrate, left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, pancytopenia/leukocytosis, and fevers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily wake-up trials, and maintaining a high respiratory system compliance (RSBI) should be implemented to reduce the risk.

2. Chest tube complications: The patient has a chest tube in place, which can lead to complications such as pneumothorax or infection. Monitoring chest tube drainage and ensuring proper placement and function is essential.

3. Infection: The patient has been on numerous antibiotics and is currently on meropenem. Despite broad coverage, there is still a risk of developing new infections. Cultures should be monitored, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be continued based on culture results.

4. Bleeding: The patient has pancytopenia with low plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation overnight with
   hypotension.  Likely med effect.
   - Trialed neo, but pt too brady, loaded amio, patient to cont on
   levophed
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
   - Discontinue diltiazem
   # Right upper lobe infiltrate: CT chest yesterday showed improvement in
   infiltrate.  VATS pathology unrevealing for etiology, however, cultures
   negative for fungus.  Patient completed a ten-day course of vancomycin
   and will discontinue
 will otherwise continue to cover broadly for
   infection in this immunocompromised patient.   Patient s/p 10 day
   vancomycin course, vancomycin stopped [**12-5**]. Voriconazole was
   discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no fungal culture growth.
   Of cipro/ flagyl [**2126-12-6**].
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Continue prednisone 60 mg for at least one month concerned for BOOP
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax: CT chest yesterday showed
   very small pneumothorax, improvement in right infiltrate, left lower
   lobe collapse.  Chest tube now to suction without leak.  Feel
   respiratory failure due to right lobe infiltrate versus volume.  Left
   lower lobe collapse likely due to mucus plugging.  No evidence of
   cardiac ischemia and think pulmonary embolus unlikely given patient has
   been on therapeutic lovenox. On propofol and off versed.
   - Continue ventilator at current settings
 P/F <200, wean FiO2
   - Continue chest tube to water seal, recheck CXR
   - Fentanyl patch for chest tube pain to allow iv fentanyl to be removed
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - Goal negative 500cc-1L today on lasix drip
   - Continue antibiotics and steroids as above
   #  Hypernatremia: in setting of intermittent tube feeds due to high
   residuals, and diuresis
   - continue diuresis
   - free water boluses, will tolerate slightly higher residuals (>150-175
   ml) if do not progressively increase
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Likely medication effect and improved
   with discontinuation of ambisome.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Off ambisome
   # Pancytopenia-
 Leukocytosis: Pancytopenia felt to be medication
   effect given timing, recovered in setting of stopping ambisome.  New
   leukocytosis concerning for infection, although remains stable
   - Cont meropenem
   - Re-culture
 stool, urine, blood
   - Sent HIT antibodies
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding
   # Hypotension: Improved despite diuresis.  Also likely component of
   sedation and pneumothorax.
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to water seal, following CXRs
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 72hours, however, on steroids.  Has been broadly
   covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus.  VATS,
   blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan, coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides. Vancomycin, voriconazole [**12-5**].
   - Discontinue ciprofloxacin, flagyl
   - Continue meropenem
   - CIS > 100.5
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, right upper lobe infiltrate, hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumothorax, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, hypotension, and fevers. He is currently on multiple medications including amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, antibiotics for infection, steroids for possible BOOP, and diuretics for fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been broadly covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus. However, there is a concern for ongoing infection due to leukocytosis and the need for continued broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cultures should be rechecked, and other sources of infection should be monitored.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: Although the patient has been on therapeutic lovenox, pulmonary embolus cannot be completely ruled out. The left lower lobe collapse may be due to mucus plugging or a potential embolism. Further investigation may be required if there are any signs of worsening respiratory failure or evidence of embolic disease.

3. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year man with B cell lymphoma on RCHOP with severe PNA s/p VATS c/b
   PTX with persistent  hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   1. Resp Failure: in setting of severe PNA and now s/p VATS with PTX -
   Oxygenation is stable, but have made slow progress with PTX and
   sedation and AFib with RVR confounding picture. Chest tube on water
   seal but still small PTX- discuss with Thoracics OK for ongoing water
   seal versus suction.
   2. Afib: in and out of RVR, continues on AMio with reasonable rate
   control now
   3. Hemodynamics: Tolerated 1 L negative yesterday and in fact we are
   weaning Neo. Would aim even to -500 today.
   4. Leukocytosis: dramatic rise yesterday, stable today and low grade
   fevers, Pan Cx without sig findings
 C diff neg x 2, urine neg, GPC in
   sputum. Plan for Abd CT in light of pain as possible occult source
   especially as he has been on high dose steroids. Appreciate ID follow
   up.
   Remaining issues as per HOusestaff notes.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of B cell lymphoma being treated with RCHOP. He is currently experiencing severe pneumonia (PNA) and has undergone video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) due to a pneumothorax (PTX). The patient is still struggling with hypoxemic respiratory failure, and his oxygenation is stable but with slow progress in resolving the PTX. The patient is also dealing with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and has been on amiodarone with reasonable rate control.

In terms of hemodynamics, the patient tolerated a negative fluid balance yesterday and is being weaned off the Neo (likely referring to neosynthesis or another form of fluid support). The plan is to continue with negative fluid balance today, aiming for -500 mL.

The patient also exhibits leukocytosis, with a dramatic rise in white blood cell count yesterday. There are low-grade fevers, but no significant findings in the pancreatic culture. The plan is to perform an abdominal CT in light of abdominal pain, considering the possibility of an occult source, especially since the patient has been on high-dose steroids.

The patient has several other ongoing issues, including potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is being managed with elevation of the head of bed (HOB), mouth care, daily wake-up, and respiratory system assessment using the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). The patient's code status is set to full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/41 mmHg to 137/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid levels, along with low hemoglobin and platelet count.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, persistent PTX, complications related to atrial fibrillation (such as thromboembolism or arrhythmia), infection (due to leukocytosis and low-grade fevers), and possible adverse effects of medications like amiodarone (such as liver toxicity or thyroid dysfunction). Additionally, the abdominal pain and use of high-dose steroids raise concerns for potential infections or gastrointestinal issues.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, cardiac rhythm, and blood parameters to prevent or manage these potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a medical history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for infectious versus inflammatory pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 57 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 85/41 mmHg to 137/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is sedated and responds to noxious stimuli.

The patient has been receiving various medications including amiodarone, fentanyl, propofol, phenylephrine, and vancomycin. The patient also has multiple lines inserted, including a PICC line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated potassium and creatinine levels, and normal liver function tests. Imaging reveals a left-sided pleural effusion.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's condition is improving in terms of oxygenation and hemodynamics. The chest tube has been placed to water seal, and the chest X-ray is stable. The plan is to switch to pressure support today and decrease sedation. The patient will continue on vancomycin for a 14-day"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of B-cell lymphoma who is currently experiencing severe pneumonia (PNA) and has undergone video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with subsequent pneumothorax (PTX). The patient is also dealing with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), and leukocytosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe pneumonia and pneumothorax have already led to respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's AFib/RVR may continue to cause hemodynamic instability and potentially lead to further complications such as heart failure or thromboembolic events.

3. Pneumothorax: The presence of PTX increases the risk of recurrent pneumothorax or development of tension pneumothorax, which can be life-threatening if not promptly recognized and managed.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. It is important to monitor for signs of sepsis or progression of the infection.

5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring and"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, then to MICU Green for VATS due to
   worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax:
   Improving.  History of respiratory issues here has been:
    * VATS [**11-29**] with pathology simply showing organizing
   pneumonitis/pneumonia
 chest tube remains in place.
   * Steroids started [**12-2**], with right upper lobe infiltrate improving
   generally since then.
   * Meropenem started [**12-2**] to complete a 14 day course; was on numerous
   other antibiotics before this
   * Left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging
   restarted vancomycin [**12-7**].
   Antifungals have been discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no
   fungal culture growth. No evidence of cardiac ischemia and pulmonary
   embolus unlikely given patient has been on therapeutic lovenox.
   - Pressure support as tolerated
   - Continue chest tube to water seal, discuss with thoracics when they
   might consider clamping
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Discontinue vancomycin this afternoon if negative cultures x 48 hours
   - Continue prednisone 60 mg daily for at least one month as concerned
   for BOOP
   - Lasix today for goal -1L; starting drip to try to meet target
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - Fentanyl patch for chest tube pain and haldol for agitation;
   discontinue fentanyl gtt
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Has had atrial fibrillation,
   sometimes with hypotension.
   - Trialed neosynephrine, but patient became too bradycardic -> loaded
   amiodarone, patient to continue on levophed
   - Continuing amiodorone PO
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
   # Acute renal failure: Improved. Likely medication effect and improved
   with discontinuation of ambisome.
   - Renally dose medications
   # Pancytopenia/Leukocytosis: Pancytopenia originally felt to be
   medication effect given timing, recovered in setting of stopping
   ambisome.  Now all three cell lines are down; sharp decrease in
   platelets, WBC, Hct.
   - recheck CBC today to verify; if counts are still down, search for
   medication effects; unclear what would be culprit on my initial review
   but further review warranted if problem persists
   - Continue meropenem
   - Discontinue vancomycin this PM if negative cultures x 48 hours
   - Pan-cultured
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 72 hours, however, on steroids.  Has been broadly
   covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus.  VATS,
   blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan, coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides.
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Discontinue vancomycin if negatiave cultures x 48 hours
   - Check CT abdomen for question abdominal tenderness
   - CIS > 100.5
   # Hypotension: Improved despite diuresis.  Also likely component of
   sedation and pneumothorax.
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to water seal, following CXRs
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - Decrease free water boluses
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Currently not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension, and subsequently underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate. The patient's conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, pancytopenia/leukocytosis, fevers, hypotension, hypernatremia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, hypogammaglobulinemia, and DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung injury if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient has been febrile for an extended period, indicating a possible ongoing infection despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. There is a risk of developing further infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if invasive procedures are required or if the platelet count continues to decrease.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of hypotension and atrial fibrillation suggests cardiovascular"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, then to MICU Green for VATS due to
   worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax:
   Improving.  History of respiratory issues here has been:
    * VATS [**11-29**] with pathology simply showing organizing
   pneumonitis/pneumonia
 chest tube remains in place.
   * Steroids started [**12-2**], with right upper lobe infiltrate improving
   generally since then.
   * Meropenem started [**12-2**] to complete a 14 day course; was on numerous
   other antibiotics before this
   * Left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging
   restarted vancomycin [**12-7**].
   Antifungals have been discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no
   fungal culture growth. No evidence of cardiac ischemia and pulmonary
   embolus unlikely given patient has been on therapeutic lovenox.
   - Pressure support as tolerated
   - Continue chest tube to water seal, discuss with thoracics when they
   might consider clamping
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Discontinue vancomycin this afternoon if negative cultures x 48 hours
   - Continue prednisone 60 mg daily for at least one month as concerned
   for BOOP
   - Lasix today for goal -1L; starting drip to try to meet target
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - Fentanyl patch for chest tube pain and haldol for agitation;
   discontinue fentanyl gtt
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Has had atrial fibrillation,
   sometimes with hypotension.
   - Trialed neosynephrine, but patient became too bradycardic -> loaded
   amiodarone, patient to continue on levophed
   - Continuing amiodorone PO
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
   # Acute renal failure: Improved. Likely medication effect and improved
   with discontinuation of ambisome.
   - Renally dose medications
   # Pancytopenia/Leukocytosis: Pancytopenia originally felt to be
   medication effect given timing, recovered in setting of stopping
   ambisome.  Now all three cell lines are down; sharp decrease in
   platelets, WBC, Hct.
   - recheck CBC today to verify; if counts are still down, search for
   medication effects; could be vancomycin which we hope to discontinue
   soon as below
   - Continue meropenem
   - Discontinue vancomycin this PM if negative cultures x 48 hours
   - Pan-cultured
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 72 hours, however, on steroids.  Has been broadly
   covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus.  VATS,
   blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan, coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides.
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Discontinue vancomycin if negatiave cultures x 48 hours
   - CIS > 100.5
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Currently not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
   - Will check in with heme-onc about when to consider re-dosing with
   additional IVIG
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate.
- He was transferred to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension, and later underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
- The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem, and steroids have been started with improvement in the right upper lobe infiltrate.
- He has also been on therapeutic lovenox for suspected pulmonary embolus.
- The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, pancytopenia/leukocytosis, fevers, and hypogammaglobulinemia.
- The patient has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and received chemotherapy (MR-CHOP) and HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
- He has been diagnosed with DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and is on prophylactic lovenox.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening right upper lobe infiltrate and hypoxic respiratory failure indicate the possibility of pneumonia. The presence of chest tube and ongoing infection could lead to further complications.
2. Atrial Fibrillation"

   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension.  Transferred to MICU Green for VATS due
   to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax:
   Improving.  Status post VATS [**11-29**] without definitive pathology
 chest
   tube remains in place.  Right upper lobe infiltrate improving on
   steroids started [**12-2**].  Has been on numerous antibiotics and is
   currently on meropenem to complete a 14-day course started [**12-2**].  Left
   lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging
 restarted
   vancomycin [**12-7**].  Antifungals discontinued due to negative fungal
   stain and no fungal culture growth. No evidence of cardiac ischemia and
   pulmonary embolus unlikely given patient has been on therapeutic
   lovenox.
   - Change ventilator to pressure support as tolerated
   - Continue chest tube to water seal
   - Thoracics following re: chest tube; appreciate
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]

   amiodarone, patient to continue on levophed
   - Start amiodorone PO
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
   # Acute renal failure: Improved. Likely medication effect and improved
   with discontinuation of ambisome.
   - Renally dose medications
   # Pancytopenia/Leukocytosis: Pancytopenia felt to be medication effect
   given timing, recovered in setting of stopping ambisome.  New
   leukocytosis concerning for infection, although remains stable.
   Hematocrit stable.  Platelets improved.
   - Continue meropenem
   - Discontinue vancomycin if negative cultures x 48 hours
   - Pan-cultured
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 72 hours, however, on steroids.  Has been broadly
   covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus.  VATS,
   blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan, coccidiodes, histoplasma,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with fevers and a new right upper lobe infiltrate. The patient has been diagnosed with various medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, right upper lobe infiltrate, pneumothorax, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, pancytopenia/leukocytosis, fevers, hypotension, hypernatremia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, hypogammaglobulinemia, and DVT.

The patient's current condition is improving. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the progress note include:

1. Prolonged ventilatory support: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is no mention of plans for extubation. If the patient's condition does not improve, prolonged ventilatory support may be required.

2. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, the patient still has leukocytosis, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Continuous monitoring and appropriate cultures should be done to identify any new or persistent infections.

3. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on therapeutic lovenox. It is important to continue anticoagulation to prevent further thromboembolic events.

4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six
   cycles of MR-CHOP) who presented on [**2126-11-23**] with fevers and new right
   upper lobe infiltrate - > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, then to MICU Green for VATS due to
   worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax:
   Improving.  History of respiratory issues here has been:
    * VATS [**11-29**] with pathology simply showing organizing
   pneumonitis/pneumonia
 chest tube remains in place.
   * Steroids started [**12-2**], with right upper lobe infiltrate improving
   generally since then.
   * Meropenem started [**12-2**] to complete a 14 day course; was on numerous
   other antibiotics before this
   * Left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging
   restarted vancomycin [**12-7**].
   Antifungals have been discontinued due to negative fungal stain and no
   fungal culture growth. No evidence of cardiac ischemia and pulmonary
   embolus unlikely given patient has been on therapeutic lovenox.
   - Pressure support as tolerated
   - Continue chest tube to water seal, discuss with thoracics when they
   might consider clamping
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Discontinue vancomycin this afternoon if negative cultures x 48 hours
   - Continue prednisone 60 mg daily for at least one month as concerned
   for BOOP
   - Lasix today for goal -1L; starting drip to try to meet target
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Oncology following; appreciate
   - Fentanyl patch for chest tube pain and haldol for agitation;
   discontinue fentanyl gtt
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Has had atrial fibrillation,
   sometimes with hypotension.
   - Trialed neosynephrine, but patient became too bradycardic -> loaded
   amiodarone, patient to continue on levophed
   - Continuing amiodorone PO
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
   # Acute renal failure: Improved. Likely medication effect and improved
   with discontinuation of ambisome.
   - Renally dose medications
   # Pancytopenia/Leukocytosis: Pancytopenia originally felt to be
   medication effect given timing, recovered in setting of stopping
   ambisome.  Now all three cell lines are down; sharp decrease in
   platelets, WBC, Hct.
   - recheck CBC today to verify; if counts are still down, search for
   medication effects; unclear what would be culprit on my initial review
   but further review warranted if problem persists
   - Continue meropenem
   - Discontinue vancomycin this PM if negative cultures x 48 hours
   - Pan-cultured
   - HIT antibodies negative
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse < 25 or bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse < 10 or bleeding
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 72 hours, however, on steroids.  Has been broadly
   covered for bacterial pathogens and VATS negative for fungus.  VATS,
   blood, sputum, BAL, urine cultures all NGTD.  Other negative testing
   includes rapid respiratory test for viral pathogens, toxoplasmosis,
   cryptococcus, aspergillus, beta-glucan, coccidiodes, histoplasma,
   strongyloides.
   - Continue meropenem to complete 14 day course, stop [**12-11**]
   - Discontinue vancomycin if negatiave cultures x 48 hours
   - Check CT abdomen for question abdominal tenderness
   - CIS > 100.5
   # Hypotension: Improved despite diuresis.  Also likely component of
   sedation and pneumothorax.
   - Wean levophed and sedation as able
   - Chest tube to water seal, following CXRs
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - Decrease free water boluses
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.
   - Currently not neutropenic
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**].
   - Status post IVIG [**12-1**]
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, presenting with fevers and new right upper lobe infiltrate. He was transferred to the ICU for worsening oxygen requirements and hypotension, then underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) due to worsening right lobe diffuse infiltrate. The patient has been on numerous antibiotics, including meropenem, and steroids for organizing pneumonitis/pneumonia. He also has a chest tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax: The patient's respiratory issues include VATS with pathology showing organizing pneumonitis/pneumonia, left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging, and right upper lobe infiltrate. These conditions can lead to respiratory failure and require close monitoring.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation, sometimes with hypotension. This condition requires careful management to maintain cardiac rhythm and blood pressure.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, which has since improved. Renal function should continue to be closely monitored.
4. Pancytopenia/Leukocytosis: The patient's blood counts are down across all three cell lines. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and dense right-sided infiltrate. He underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and developed persistent hypoxemia, tension pneumothorax, and is now slowly being weaned off sedation and pressors.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 98/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 50%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory complaints.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, lactate, and lactic acid. His electrolytes are within normal range, but his triglycerides are elevated.

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, steroids, diuretics, and anticoagulation therapy. He has multiple lines including a PICC line, arterial line, and multi-lumen central line. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis.

The patient's condition is critical, and he remains in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to right upper lobe infiltrate following VATS surgery. The patient also has a history of pneumonia, left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Other medical conditions include hypogammaglobulinemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for which he has received chemotherapy. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's condition could worsen if oxygenation does not improve or if there is further deterioration in lung function.
2. Pneumothorax: The presence of a chest tube suggests that the patient may have had a pneumothorax previously, and there is a risk of recurrence or complications related to the chest tube.
3. Infections: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, indicating a concern for ongoing or recurrent infections. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or development of new infections.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation increases the risk of cardiac complications such as stroke or heart failure.
5. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT, and anticoagulation therapy is ongoing. There is a risk of throm"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient had undergone VATS surgery and was diagnosed with right upper lobe infiltrate, which has improved with steroids. However, the patient also has left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging. The patient has been started on vancomycin and will continue meropenem until December 11th. The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has been managed with amiodarone and levophed. The patient is also being monitored for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, hypogammaglobulinemia, and DVT. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse suggests a possible pneumonia. This can be a serious infection and may require additional antibiotics or interventions.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team is taking measures to prevent this by elevating the head of bed, performing mouth care, and monitoring the respiratory system's resistance and compliance.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a known DVT and is on prophylaxis with lovenox. It is important to continue this prophylaxis to prevent clot formation and potential pulmonary"

   Comments:
   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds  Comments:
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions. The patient has a history of acute pain, chronic pain, seizure with status epilepticus, hospital-acquired pneumonia (possibly related to barotrauma from mechanical ventilation), fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, hypotension (not in shock), pneumonia, and other unspecified issues.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 114/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide their own medical history.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.8 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, and slightly low platelet count of 130 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes are within normal range.

The patient has multiple lines inserted including a PICC line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. They are receiving medications for pain control, seizure prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,645 mL with 395 mL going into the total intravenous fluids, 1,324 mL going into the enteral route, and 1,676 mL into the intravenous fluids through the multi-lumen line. The total output includes 5,185 mL of blood products and 4,605 mL of urine.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are thin and anxious, with PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in place, clear breath sounds without any crackles or wheezes, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and muscle wasting noted.

Overall, the patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management in the ICU. These complications include acute pain, seizure with status epilepticus, hospital-acquired pneumonia, fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, pneumonia, and other unspecified issues."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe infiltrate. He has undergone a VATS procedure revealing pneumonitis/pneumonia and has shown improvement since starting steroids. The patient also has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was previously treated with amiodarone. He is currently on levophed for hemodynamic support. The patient has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is on anticoagulation therapy with lovenox. Other medical conditions include hypogammaglobulinemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure could potentially worsen if there is further deterioration of lung function or if the underlying cause of the right upper lobe infiltrate progresses.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia could progress and lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, such as increased difficulty breathing or increased oxygen requirements.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could recur, leading to hemodynamic instability or thromboembolic complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who is currently in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is sedated and has been intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. To prevent this, the healthcare team should follow strict infection control measures, such as elevating the head of the bed, performing daily wake-up calls, and providing mouth care.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to prevent the development of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at increased risk of developing stress ulcers. The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating fluid overload. This needs to be carefully managed to"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident
s note, and would emphasize and add the following points:
   60 year old man PMH DLBCL p/w hypoxemic respiratory failure and
   complicated ICU course notable for tension pneumothorax, hypotension
   and recurrent afib with RVR. Completing empiric course of antibiotics
   for right sided infiltrate and on 60mg of prednisone likely for [**1-21**]
   weeks.
   Plan as per resident note. Briefly, marginal oxygenation (pO2:FiO2
   ratio of 197) likely secondary to fluid at this point aim negative
   500cc to 1L today. Persistent issues with afib with RVR and hypotension
   in association with sedation and nodal agents for afib. S/P amio load
   and on po now. Nearly ready to extubate. Chest tube removed.
   Contraction alkalosis for which we will give diamox today. Further
   plans as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of DLBCL, who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has had a complicated ICU course, including tension pneumothorax, hypotension, and recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). He has completed an empiric course of antibiotics for a right-sided infiltrate and is on 60mg of prednisone for likely 1-2 weeks. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 114/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg. He is receiving fluids through IVF and has a total fluid intake of 3,645 mL since midnight. His total fluid output is 5,185 mL, resulting in a balance of -1,540 mL. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%. His respiratory system compliance is 40.9 cmH2O/mL, and his PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 196. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, platelet count of 130 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 106 mg/dL, and sodium of 142 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and purposeful movement with normal heart sounds. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of hypoxemic respiratory failure, fluid resuscitation with a target negative fluid balance of 500-1000 mL today, continued treatment for atrial fibrillation, and preparation for potential extubation. Contraction alkalosis is also noted and will be managed with diamox. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's condition is critical and he is at risk for further respiratory failure, worsening hypotension, and complications related to his underlying DLBCL. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to a right upper lobe infiltrate. He underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) and chest tubes were discontinued. Steroids were started on 12/2 and the right upper lobe infiltrate has been improving since then. Left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse is likely due to mucus plugging. The patient is also being treated for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is in the ICU receiving invasive ventilation, and his condition is improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring respiratory status and implementing appropriate measures such as head of bed elevation, daily wake-up trials, and regular suctioning of the airway can help prevent and manage this complication.
2. Mucus plugging: The presence of left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse suggests the possibility of mucus plugging. Adequate clearance of secretions through chest physiotherapy and suctioning is important to prevent further complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is receiving prophylactic therapy with low molecular weight heparin (lovenox). Regular monitoring of the lower extremities for signs of"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to a right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax. The patient has also had left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely caused by mucus plugging. The patient underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) on 11/29, which revealed pneumonitis/pneumonia. Steroids were started on 12/2, and the right upper lobe infiltrate has been improving generally since then. 

The patient has been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, fluid overload, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 160/84 mmHg, heart rate of 101 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's medication includes midazolam (versed), haloperidol (Haldol), enoxaparin (lovenox), lorazepam (Ativan), morphine sulfate, and amiodarone PO. 

The plan is to continue meropenem until the end of the 14-day course"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax. He has undergone VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) which revealed pneumonitis/pneumonia. The patient has also been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, DVT (deep vein thrombosis), and hypogammaglobulinemia. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax has led to hypoxic respiratory failure. This condition can progress to severe hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, and even respiratory arrest if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of right upper lobe infiltrate suggests a possible pneumonia. If left untreated, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, systemic infection, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke. It is crucial to monitor and control his heart rate and rhythm to prevent complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, indicating an increased risk of pulmonary embolism if not properly managed. Antico"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He is currently intubated in the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by right upper lobe infiltrate/pneumothorax. The patient has been improving since starting steroids and shows signs of recovery. However, he experiences transient hypotension requiring pressors after receiving a versed bolus yesterday. The patient also has a left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse likely due to mucus plugging. He has fluid overload, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's current medications include midazolam (versed), haloperidol (Haldol), enoxaparin (lovenox), lorazepam (Ativan), morphine sulfate, and amiodarone PO. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased cough, and worsening oxygenation is essential.
2. Mucus plugging: The patient's left lower lobe infiltrate/collapse may be due to mucus plugging. Adequate suctioning and chest physiotherapy should be provided to prevent further mucus accumulation and complications.

   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident
s note, and would emphasize and add the following points:
   60 year old man PMH DLBCL p/w hypoxemic respiratory failure d/t
   pneumonia vs COP, complicated ICU course notable for tension
   pneumothorax, hypotension and recurrent afib with RVR. Completing
   empiric course of antibiotics for right sided infiltrate and on 60mg of
   prednisone likely for 2-4 weeks.
   Hypotension overnight likely due to increased sedation. No episodes of
   RVR. S/p amio load, now on po. Ongoing respiratory failure this AM but
   tolerated PSV 5, Peep 0 with PO2 ~90. Extubated uneventfully on rounds.
   Off meropenem. Continue vancomycin pending finalization of recent
   sputum culutre. Continues on empric prednisone 60mg. Further plans as
   per resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient had an ICU course complicated by tension pneumothorax, hypotension, and recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient completed an empiric course of antibiotics for a right-sided infiltrate and is currently on 60mg of prednisone likely for 2-4 weeks.

The patient experienced hypotension overnight due to increased sedation but had no further episodes of RVR. The patient successfully underwent amiodarone loading, is now on oral medication, and continues to have ongoing respiratory failure. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 and achieved a PO2 of ~90. The patient was extubated uneventfully during rounds.

The patient is off meropenem but will continue on vancomycin pending the finalization of recent sputum culture results. The patient remains on empiric prednisone 60mg. The further plans for the patient are mentioned in the resident's note.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, has a PICC line placed on [**2126-11-25**] at 08:00 PM, an arterial line placed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has a history of fatigue, altered mental status, pain control, seizure, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/40 to 101/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no rashes or jaundice observed. His extremities show some edema, and there is evidence of muscle wasting. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated liver enzymes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, indicating a pre-existing respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of respiratory support will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Seizure and status epilepticus: The patient has had a seizure in the past, and there is a concern for ongoing seizure activity or status epilepticus. Proper seizure management, including the use of antiepileptic drugs, will be required to control any further seizure episodes.

3. Infection: The patient's fever of unknown origin and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an underlying infection. Cultures and appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old male with history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma RUL
   infiltrate s/p VATS extubated yesterday AM w/o complication, currently
   doing well.
   # RUL infiltrate
 VATS [**11-29**] revealed pneumonitis/pneumonia. Sating in
   low 90s on RA.
   - continue incentive spirometry
   - 14 day course of meropenem completed yesterday
   - Continue prednisone slow taper for at least one month for organizing
   PNA
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis
   # s/p VATS: fentanyl patch for pain control
   # Fluid overload- in the setting of fluid resuscitation for
   hypotension, has been autodiuresing
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: stable.
   - Continue amiodorone PO
   - Anticoagulated with lovenox
   # Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Status post [**5-24**] cycles of MR-CHOP.
   Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission.  Complicated by
   Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG 311 [**12-1**]- - Status post IVIG [**12-1**].
   - Oncology following, appreciate their input
   - Monitor hematocrit and transfuse for < 25 or active bleeding
   - Monitor platelets and transfuse for < 10 active bleeding
    # DVT: Diagnosed 11/[**2125**].
   - Continue lovenox treatment

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) for a right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate. He was previously intubated but has since been extubated without complications. He is currently doing well, with vital signs stable and within normal limits. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which he is receiving appropriate treatment. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to chemotherapy. His current medications include pantoprazole, enoxaparin, meropenem, prednisone, bactrim, fentanyl patch, amiodarone, and IVIG. The patient is being closely monitored for potential complications such as fluid overload, low blood counts, and bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a common complication in patients with weakened immune systems or those who have undergone invasive procedures like VATS. Monitoring of respiratory status, oxygenation, and response to antibiotics is crucial.
2. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a cardiac arrhythmia. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm, along with appropriate antiarrhythmic medication and anticoag"
