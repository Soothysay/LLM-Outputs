","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery two years ago. He has a history of known occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the right posterior descending artery (RPDA) and left circumflex artery (LCX), for which he received a bare metal stent (BMS). The patient is now presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI, likely due to progression of LCX disease. The treatment plan includes maximizing medical management and planning for invasive management in the morning with catheterization if the patient can tolerate it. The patient will continue taking aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Plavix), and a statin. Heparin infusion has been started, and the dose of Coreg has been increased to 25 mg orally twice daily. Imdur 120 mg orally daily will also be continued. Nitro drip will be started if the patient develops chest pain or hypertension.

The patient is also diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) with depressed ejection fraction and acute exacerbation. Treatment for CHF includes diuresis with 40 mg IV lasix as needed, morphine for symptomatic relief, consideration of nitro drip as mentioned before, increased dose of Coreg, and holding ACE inhibitors due to renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient's recent events include agitation upon arrival to the floor, requiring multiple doses of Haldol and Zyprexa, with Morphine seeming to be the best medication. The IV team placed a peripherally inserted intravenous (PIV) line, but the patient pulled it out again in the morning. The patient did not experience chest pain during episodes and had stable blood pressures, so a nitro drip was not started. The patient has a history of allergy to sulfa antibiotics and unknown allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2121-4-9**]. The patient is currently receiving Heparin Sodium infusion at 850 units per hour and other ICU medications. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 139/54 mmHg to 140/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The fluid balance shows a total input of 21 mL and output of 780 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes delivery of oxygen through a nasal cannula, and their arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided. The physical examination notes were"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and had a previous stent placement in the left circumflex artery. He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema. The patient is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, statin, Coreg, and Im Durant. He is also receiving heparin through a continuous infusion. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 139/54 mmHg to 140/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals agitation, well-healed scar around the left scapula, ronchi/crackles bilaterally, and wheezing. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal potassium and sodium levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and blood glucose levels. The troponin-T level is within normal range, and the EKG shows lateral defect, indicating possible progression of LCX disease. 

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for NSTEMI, congestive heart failure (CHF) with depressed ejection"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CABG surgery and a recent myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He is currently in the ICU for flash pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments including diuretics, beta-blockers, and statins. He also has renal failure, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The patient is agitated and refusing to take oral medications. He requires conscious sedation for a planned cardiac catheterization procedure tomorrow morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 65-116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/49 to 169/92 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals well-healed surgical scars and signs consistent with heart failure. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin levels, along with abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's medications include heparin, furosemide, morphine, ranitidine, and others. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa antibiotics and unknown allergens. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, further deterioration of renal function, and possible bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants like heparin."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and now presents with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's medical history includes a previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, complicated urinary tract infection, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and delirium. The patient has refused to take oral medications including aspirin and Plavix. He has been given Haldol for agitation and received blood products and Lasix. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 125/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings include well-healed scar around the left scapula, ronchi/crackles in the lungs, and no carotid bruit. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, potassium, and sodium, while other values are within normal range. The patient's CK and Troponin-T levels are decreasing. The patient is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, statin, Coreg, and Imdur, and is receiving heparin infusion. The plan is to proceed with a cardiac catheterization today, possibly with conscious sedation or intubation as determined by anesthesia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to ongoing ischemia.
2. Delirium due to NSTEMI, CHF, and/or UTI.
3. Renal insufficiency and acute kidney injury.
4. Complications related to cardiac catheterization, such as access site infection or bleeding.
5. Possible worsening of respiratory status due to pulmonary edema.
6. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and anticoagulation therapy.
7. Stress ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9. Hyperglycemia and poor glycemic control.
10. Infection at the central line or Foley catheter site."

","The patient is an 80-year-old male who underwent two coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) procedures, with a left internal mammary artery (LIMA) anastomosis to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, a saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the obtuse marginal branch (OM2), and an SVG to the right posterior descending artery (RPDA). The patient also had a bare metal stent (BMS) placed in the left circumflex artery (LCX) on January 28th, and is now presenting with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's EKG shows a lateral defect, indicating a likely progression of LCX disease. The patient is currently being managed medically overnight and will undergo invasive management in the morning with a cardiac catheterization. The patient is to continue taking aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Plavix), and statin medications. Heparin infusion has been initiated, and the dose of Coreg (generic name: carvedilol) has been increased to 25 mg orally twice daily. Imdur (generic name: isosorbide mononitrate) 120 mg orally daily will be started, and a nitroglycerin drip may be considered if chest pain recurs or if the patient becomes hypertensive.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He presented with flash pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments including diuretics, anticoagulants, and cardiac medications. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
   - Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recent NSTEMI, which puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as unstable angina or another myocardial infarction.
   - Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of congestive heart failure and current symptoms, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock if his cardiac function deteriorates.

2. Respiratory Complications:
   - Pneumonia: The patient's immobility and use of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
   - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's flash pulmonary edema and underlying heart failure could predispose him to the development of ARDS, which can result in severe respiratory distress.

3. Renal Complications:
   - Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of chronic kidney disease, use of neph"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who underwent 2 coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) in the past, including a left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), a saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the right posterior descending artery (RPDA), and an SVG to the omohyoid artery (OM2). He also had a bare-metal stent (BMS) placed in the left circumflex artery (LCx) on [**2121-1-28**]. The patient presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema. His EKG showed lateral defects, likely progression of LCx disease. A cardiac catheterization was performed, revealing progression of all three vessels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe coronary artery disease. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe disease in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The left circumflex artery (LCx) was stented, and the RCA was ballooned. The omohyoid artery (OM) is 90% blocked and also ballooned.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/55-162/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,090 mL and output of 980 mL, with a positive balance of 110 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, and there is no mention of any urine output or other drainage issues.

The patient's blood products show a total input of 980 mL, with an output of 980 mL, resulting in a balance of 0 mL. The patient's electrolyte levels appear to be within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.7 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 169 K/uL. The creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, and troponin-T level is 0.46 ng/mL. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are provided but not specifically mentioned.

The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, delirium/confusion, and chest pain. The ICU care plan includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate line management. Prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pulmonary edema, exacerbation of delirium/confusion, and further cardiac issues due to the severe coronary artery disease. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, mental status, and cardiac function will be necessary to prevent these complications and provide appropriate interventions if needed."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He has a history of occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the right posterior descending artery (RPDA), and he previously had a bare metal stent (BMS) placed in the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient is currently presenting with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema. His EKG shows a lateral defect, indicating progression of LCx disease. His CK level is trending down.

The patient is on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, statin, Coreg, and ImDur. He is also receiving heparin through a gastrointestinal tube. If he develops chest pain or hypertension, nitroglycerin should be considered. A plan for a cardiac catheterization procedure today has been made, and anesthesia consultation will determine whether conscious sedation or intubation is needed.

The patient also has congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%, and he experienced an acute exacerbation of CHF likely due to ischemia. Diuretic therapy with 40 mg IV lasix as needed for shortness of breath is recommended, along with an echocardiogram post-catheterization. ACE inhibitors should be held due to renal failure.

The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI"

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, including previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe disease in all three coronary vessels. He received balloon angioplasty to the right coronary artery (RCA), stenting of the proximal left circumflex artery (LCx), and angioplasty of the left main stem (OM). The patient's left anterior descending artery (LAD) graft showed severe disease. 

The patient is currently asymptomatic, with stable vital signs and no signs of recurrent pulmonary edema following the catheterization. He has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45% and acute exacerbation. The patient also has complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and delirium.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who has undergone two coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). He has a history of occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the right posterior descending artery (RPA) and a bare metal stent (BMS) in the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient presents with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema. His ejection fraction (EF) is 45%. The patient also has congestive heart failure (CHF), complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and delirium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
- Progression of coronary artery disease leading to further myocardial ischemia or infarction.
- Development of heart failure exacerbation due to increased cardiac workload or decreased cardiac output.
- Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.

2. Respiratory Complications:
- Worsening pulmonary edema leading to respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
- Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.

3. Renal Complications:
- Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension, use of nephrotoxic medications, or volume depletion.
- Chronic kidney disease"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who has undergone two coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries. He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's EKG showed lateral defects, indicating progression of left circumflex artery disease. Cardiac catheterization confirmed the progression of all three vessels, and the patient underwent balloon angioplasty to the right coronary artery (RCA) and placement of a stent in the proximal left circumflex artery (LCX), which was 80% stenosed. Angioplasty was also performed on the omohyoid artery (OM). The patient's left anterior descending (LAD) graft showed severe disease.

The patient is currently being managed medically with aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (plavix), statin, coreg, and imdur. Repeat coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is not recommended for this patient. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed to evaluate wall motion abnormalities (WMA) and ejection fraction (EF).

The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an EF of 45% in February 24th and an acute exacerbation. The acute decompensation is likely due to recent ischemia. The patient is currently asymptomatic and does not show signs of recurrent pulmonary edema following the catheter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and delirium. He was admitted to the ICU for chest pain and pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/54 mmHg to 147/117 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has received a blood transfusion with one unit. He is also on lasix, seroquel, and losartan.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 189 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, high potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 51 mg/dL, and normal creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. The cardiac enzymes Troponin-T is elevated at 1.60 ng/mL, indicating myocardial injury. The echocardiogram reveals left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30%. There is also mild aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation. No pericardial effusion is noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension and hypoperfusion, or nephrotoxic drugs.
2. Pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.
5. Delirium or confusion due to sepsis, hypoxia, or medication side effects.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or ischemic heart disease.
7. Sepsis or septic shock due to hospital-acquired infections or inadequate source control.
8. Worsening heart failure symptoms due to fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer or anticoagulation therapy.
10. Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility and pressure from medical devices."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who underwent two coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries and also had a bare metal stent (BMS) placed in the left circumflex artery. He presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 30% with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. He underwent balloon angioplasty to the right coronary artery (RCA) and proximal left circumflex artery, as well as angioplasty to the obtuse marginal branch. The patient's left anterior descending (LAD) graft showed severe disease. The patient is currently asymptomatic and not showing signs of recurrent pulmonary edema following the catheterization. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Congestive heart failure (CHF) due to the patient's low EF of 30%.
2. Recurrent pulmonary edema, which the patient experienced previously and needs to be closely monitored.
3. Complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) due to the indwelling Foley catheter.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) indicated by the elevated creatinine levels.
5. Hypertension (HTN) which is being managed with multiple medications.
6. Dyslipidemia which requires ongoing treatment with high-dose atorvastatin.
7. Delirium, which requires reorientation"

   Imaging: TTE showed: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30%) secondary to severe
   hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. The basal
   inferior septum and inferior free wall are dyskinetic. The anterior
   septum is also hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male s/p 2 CABG(LIMA-LAD, known occluded SVG to OM2, SVG to RPDA)
   s/p BMS LCX [**2121-1-28**], now presenting with NSTEMI and flash pulmonary
   edema.
   # NSTEMI: EKG showed lateral defect, likely progression of LCX disease.
   Confirmed by cardiac cath yesterday which showed progression of all 3
   vessels.  Pt underwent balloon angioplasty to RCA, proximal LCx stent
   placement (was 80% stenosed), and the OM had angioplasty as well.  His
   LAD graft showed severe disease.
   - continue medical management with ASA, plavix, statin, coreg and
   imdur. Added back [**Last Name (un) **] as creatinine at baseline.
   - not a candidate for repeat CABG
   - TTE showed EF 30% with severe HK/AK inferior and posterior walls
   post-cath
   # Congestive heart failure with EF of 45% in [**2-24**] & acute exacerbation.
   Acute decompensation likely [**1-20**] ischemia.  The patient is currently
   asymptomatic, no sign of recurrent pulmonary edema following cath.
   - diurese with 40mg IV lasix PRN for SOB
   # Complicated UTI: cipro x 7 days.
   # CRI - (Cr 1.8-2.1 in [**2121-1-19**]).  Cre stable at 1.9 post cath.
   -  continue to hold [**Last Name (un) **], HCTZ and NSAIDS
   # HTN:   Continue isosorbide mononitrate carvedilol and [**Last Name (un) **].
   # Dyslipidemia:  Continue high dose atorvastatin
   # Delerium: Stable. Pull foley, reorient. Does better with seroquel.
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with Colace, Senna PRN

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male who has undergone two coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries in the past. He presented with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) showed lateral defects, suggesting progression of disease in the left circumflex artery (LCX). Cardiac catheterization confirmed the progression of all three coronary vessels. The patient underwent balloon angioplasty to the right coronary artery (RCA) and placement of a stent in the proximal LCX, which was 80% stenosed. Angioplasty was also performed on the omohyoid artery (OM). The patient's left anterior descending (LAD) graft showed severe disease.

The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 30%, indicating moderately-to-severely depressed systolic function. There is severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, along with mild aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation. There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

The patient's current medications include aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (plavix), statin, coreg (metoprolol), and imdur (isosorbide mononitrate). He is not a candidate for repeat CABG surgery.
