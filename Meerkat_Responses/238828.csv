   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   76M with IPF on home O2 - admitted 2 weeks ago with respiratory
   distress and worsening hypoxemia. His symptoms worsened 2 weeks prior
   to that admission. CT-A showed worse fibrosis and widespread ground
   glass infiltrates compared with [**2185**]. He was given steroids and
   discharged after 4-5 days to rehab.
   At rehab, his symptoms improved and he was weaned from 4 LPM to his
   baseline 2 LPM of O2. Discharged home 1 week ago.
   This AM he became acutely dyspneic, along with fevers and cough
   productive of yellow/bloody sputum. In outside ER - temp was 102. He
   was placed on 100% NRB and was given antibiotics and solumedrol. ABG
   showed 7.47/32/73 on 100% NRB. His current prednisone dose is 20mg qd.
   He had 3 episodes of post-tussis emesis. CXR showed new right mid lung
   field infiltrate.
   In our ER, afebrile, 88% on 6 LPM.

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp distress - presentation appears most compatible with acute
   infection. His ILD has clearly worsened radiographically over the past
   3 years though there's no convincing evidence an IPF flare explains
   either admission this month. His serial PFTs are variable and difficult
   to interpret. The clinical improvement over the past 2-3 weeks makes an
   IPF flare an unlikely explanation for the prior admission. This admit
   due to fever, hypoxemia and a new infiltrate seems to be due to
   pneumonia. Will treat for pneumonia broadly, continue at current
   prednisone dose. Doubt PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 7511**]. Wean O2 as tolerated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), was admitted to the ICU two weeks ago with respiratory distress and worsening hypoxemia. His symptoms worsened prior to admission, and a CT scan showed worse fibrosis and widespread ground glass infiltrates. He was given steroids and discharged after 4-5 days to rehab, where his symptoms improved, and he was weaned off oxygen therapy. He was discharged home one week ago.

However, this morning, the patient became acutely dyspneic, with fevers and cough productive of yellow/bloody sputum. He presented to the outside ER, where he was placed on 100% non-rebreather (NRB) and given antibiotics and solumedrol. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.47, PaCO2 32, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 73 on 100% NRB. His current prednisone dose is 20 mg qd. He has also experienced three episodes of post-tussis emesis.

A chest X-ray revealed a new right mid lung field infiltrate. In the ICU, the patient is afebrile and on 6 liters per minute (LPM) of oxygen. He has a history of IPF, coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with stenting, spinal stenosis, gastroesophageal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was recently admitted for a presumed IPF exacerbation. The patient is now experiencing acute respiratory failure, characterized by worsening shortness of breath, hypoxemia, fever, chills, and a right lung infiltrate consistent with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP).

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including cefepime and vancomycin for HCAP, and further investigations such as sputum culture and chest X-ray are planned. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 122/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is requiring high-flow oxygen supplementation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 104 mEq/L, and elevated lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's renal function is also normal.

The patient's past medical history includes coronary artery disease, for which he is taking aspirin, Plavix, beta-blockers, and I"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who was recently admitted with presumed IPF exacerbation. He is now presenting with acute worsening shortness of breath, hypoxemia, fever, chills, and right infiltrate consistent with HCAP (Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia). The patient has been hospitalized for three weeks and has been on various medications including cefepime, vancomycin for HCAP, prednisone, and N-acetylcysteine. He also has a history of CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) and GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern as indicated by his acute worsening shortness of breath and hypoxemia. He requires high-flow oxygen and has been placed on non-rebreather mask. There is a concern for possible progression to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
2. Pneumonia: The presence of right infiltrate on imaging suggests pneumonia, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots. A bilateral lower extremity ultrasound is recommended to assess for DVT.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of CAD"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxemia and pneumonia. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently being treated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 132/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a non-rebreather mask and has an ABG result of 7.47/36/80. Physical examination reveals moderate respiratory distress, regular rapid respirations, bibasilar crackles, and scattered rhochi throughout. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased sodium, potassium, and blood urea nitrogen levels. The patient's troponin T level is within normal range. 

The patient's assessment includes hypoxemia likely due to right-sided pneumonia, with the possibility of exacerbation of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The plan includes continuing vancomycin and cefepime, increasing steroids to 60mg daily, and checking for Legionella. Oxygenation remains tenuous, making it unstable to send the patient for a CT scan. Hemoptysis is likely due to pneumonia/bronchiectasis in combination with aspirin/Plavix use. Empiric heparin will not be started due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of pulmonary fibrosis who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia due to likely right-sided pneumonia. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note are:

1. Exacerbation of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis): The patient's underlying lung condition may worsen due to the pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation remains tenuous, indicating a high risk for respiratory failure.
3. Hemoptysis: The presence of hemoptysis suggests the possibility of severe pneumonia or bronchiectasis.
4. Bleeding risk: Due to the patient's history of angioedema with ACE inhibitors, there is a risk of bleeding, particularly if heparin therapy is initiated.
5. Infection: The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and ciprofloxacin) for suspected pneumonia, indicating a risk of infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with pulmonary fibrosis and hypoxemia, likely due to pneumonia. He requires high-flow oxygen to maintain saturation levels in the mid-90s. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Cefepime), and his last dose of antibiotics was administered on 07/16/2189 at 08:33 PM. He is also receiving other ICU medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's review of systems shows fever, dyspnea, and tachypnea. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 132/59 to 141/72 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated troponin T, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition remains tenuous, and he is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, some potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory distress could progress to ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count, there is a risk of developing sepsis, especially"

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing worsening shortness of breath, fevers, chills, and hemoptysis, which are suggestive of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). The patient underwent an endotracheal intubation due to desaturation to 40s while urinating. Bleeding ultrasounds showed no deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and cardiac enzymes ruled out myocardial infarction (MI). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure control mode, and his goal oxygen saturation is around 92%. He is also receiving intravenous antibiotics for HCAP and steroids for possible worsening interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The patient's sedation is managed with midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol, and he is being weaned off propofol today. The patient's urine output is low, and he is being monitored closely for any signs of infection or complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period.
2. Barotrauma: The use of high pressures during mechanical ventilation can cause barotrauma, leading to lung injury.
3. Volutrauma: Excessive volume delivery during mechanical ventilation can result in volutrauma, causing lung overdistension and injury.
4. Oxygen toxicity: Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of supplemental oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity, which may impair lung function.
5. DVT/PE: Despite ruling out DVT through bleeding ultrasounds, the patient is still at risk for developing a clot due to immobility and the presence of multiple risk factors.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing new infections due to invasive procedures, prolonged immobility, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
7. Steroid-induced complications: Long-term use of steroids can lead to various complications such as hyperglycemia, muscle weakness, and opportunistic infections.
8. Medication side effects: The patient may experience side effects from the medications he is receiving, including sedation, respiratory depression, and electrolyte imbalances.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consider additional clinical information and diagnostic tests to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions.

The patient experienced desaturation to the high 60s when getting up to urinate, and later to 40s. As a result, the patient was intubated and an OG tube was placed.

An arterial line was started, and an ultrasound showed no deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The family was called, and there was an extensive discussion with an interpreter about the patient's condition and goals of care. Consent was obtained in the afternoon.

The patient has allergies to ace inhibitors and angioedema. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 07/17/2018 at 08:01 PM, cefepime on 07/17/2018 at 09:00 PM, and ciprofloxacin on 07/17/2018 at 11:15 PM.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam (versed) at 8 mg/hour, fentanyl (concentrate) at 200 mcg/hour, and propofol at 30 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include omeprazole (Prilosec) on 07/17/2018 at 08:04 AM and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) on 07/17/2018 at 03:04 PM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.7 C (96.2 F), heart rate of 67 bpm with a range of 53-125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from "

   history of PE or DVT, malignancy, immobilization, or HR>100.  Patient
   desated last night while urinating to 40s. He was intubated as a
   result.
   - BLE U/S showed no DVT
   - MI ruled out with cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat CXR today for OG tube placement and tomorrow to monitor if
   lungs worsening
   - Ventilation: Will try pressure control. If he does not tolerate, will
   paralyze the patient and look into esophageal balloon.
   - Q6 ABGs: Tolerating permissive hypercapnia as long as pH > 7.20. Will
   try to decrease FiO2 throughout the day. Goal O2 sat around 92%.
   - Increased Steroids to Solumedrol to 60mg IV in case this is worsening

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis admitted to the MICU for acute worsening of baseline shortness of breath. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease: The patient has a history of CAD, which can lead to decreased blood flow to the heart muscle and potentially result in a heart attack or other cardiac complications.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is experiencing worsening shortness of breath, and there is suspicion of pneumonia. Infiltrate on CXR and symptoms of fevers, chills, and hemoptysis suggest the possibility of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and appropriate antibiotics have been initiated.

3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This can be due to various causes such as sepsis, heart failure, or dehydration. The patient is receiving fluids and vasopressors as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF): The patient has a pre-existing condition of pulmonary fibrosis, which is worsening. Steroids have been increased to manage this condition.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): There is concern for DVT, but it has been ruled out with a lower extremity ultrasound.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis admitted to the MICU for acute worsening of baseline shortness of breath. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with PCV+Assist mode. His SpO2 is currently at 91% despite receiving supplemental oxygen (FiO2 at 60%). The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 108, suggesting respiratory failure that is not consistent with ARDS.

2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which could contribute to his current condition.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 93/46 to 114/63 mmHg. This hypotension is not classified as shock.

4. Potential Opportunistic Infections: Given the patient's use of steroids and worsening clinical course, there is a concern for opportunistic infections such as pneumonia. Infiltrate on CXR and symptoms of fevers/chills/hemoptysis are suggestive of HCAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia).

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's leg cramping raises suspicion for DVT, although the doctor has dichotom"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis. He was admitted to the MICU with acute worsening of shortness of breath. The patient has been on steroids, which raises concerns for opportunistic infections if his clinical course does not improve. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypotension (not in shock).

The patient has been experiencing worsening IPF vs. pneumonia, with infiltrate on CXR and history of fevers/chills/hemoptysis suggestive of HCAP. The physician is considering the possibility of opportunistic infections due to the patient's use of steroids. Dichotomozed suggesting PE unlikely. No history of PE or DVT, malignancy, immobilization, or HR >100.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/46 to 114/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 91%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's weight is 84.5 kg, and height is 68 inches. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg.

The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, sodium of 137 K/uL, potassium of 4"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis who was admitted to the MICU with acute worsening of baseline shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypotension. 

The patient's vital signs show bradycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PCV mode, with a set respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute and FiO2 of 60%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The troponin T levels are within normal range. 

Imaging shows a chest X-ray that is unchanged with different penetration. Microbiology tests are pending for urine, blood, and ET sputum. 

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing sedation with versed, fentanyl, and cisatracurium due to difficulty with vent synchrony. They also plan to perform a mini-BAL today to try to get the organism and may consider discontinuing antibiotics if negative. The patient will continue receiving tube feeds starting today with Nutren Pulmonary. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and opportunistic infections due to prolonged steroid use."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who was recently admitted with a presumed IPF exacerbation. He presented with acute worsening of shortness of breath, hypoxemia, fever, chills, and right infiltrate consistent with HCAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia). The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated empirically for healthcare-associated pneumonia while awaiting chest x-ray data. Given his prolonged course of steroids, he is also at increased risk of opportunistic pathogens and should be considered immunosuppressed if there is no improvement with antibiotics covering typical healthcare-associated pathogens.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, and leukocytosis, along with the right infiltrate on chest x-ray, suggest a possible pneumonia. It is important to monitor his oxygenation, respiratory status, and white blood cell count closely. Antibiotics have already been started empirically, and further cultures will help guide targeted therapy.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's acute worsening of shortness of breath and hypoxemia, there is a risk of developing ARDS. Close monitoring of his oxygenation, respiratory effort, and chest x-ray findings will help identify early signs of ARDS. Supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation may be required if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for shortness of breath (SOB). He has been experiencing worsening SOB, increased O2 requirement, fever, chills, and leukocytosis. There is a concern for the development of pneumonia (PNA) versus worsening of fibrotic lung disease. The patient was previously hospitalized and has been in rehab, so empiric antibiotic coverage will cover healthcare-associated PNA. The patient has also been on a course of steroids, which may make him immunosuppressed. However, the patient has been afebrile since admission and does not have leukocytosis, making pulmonary fibrosis more likely. He is currently intubated on PCV + assist with good arterial blood gas (ABG) values. A chest X-ray (CXR) shows diffuse opacities. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure of 107/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds throughout and dry inspiratory crackles. The patient's laboratory values are within normal ranges, except for a slightly elevated lactate level. The assessment and plan include continuing steroid therapy, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for IPF, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. The patient presented with worsening SOB, increased oxygen requirement, fever, chills, and leukocytosis. There is concern for the development of pneumonia (PNA) versus worsening of fibrotic lung disease. The patient has been hospitalized in the last 30 days and has been in rehab, so empiric antibiotic coverage will cover healthcare-associated PNA. The patient is also on a course of steroids, which may have immunosuppressed him. The patient's fever has resolved since admission, and there is no leukocytosis, making pulmonary fibrosis more likely. The patient is currently intubated on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) with assist and has good arterial blood gas (ABG) values. A chest X-ray shows diffuse opacities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's symptoms and leukocytosis raise concerns for the development of pneumonia. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated to cover healthcare-associated PNA.
2. Worsening of fibrotic lung disease: The patient's history of IPF and current symptoms suggest that his underlying lung condition may be worsening. Steroids and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are being continued to manage this possibility.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF
   exacerbation vs pneumonia.
   #  Shortness of breath: The patient presented with worsening SOB and
   increased O2 requirement with fever, chills and leukocytosis. Possible
   R infiltrate so concern for development of PNA vs worsening of fibrotic
   lung disease. The patient was hospitalized in the last 30 days and has
   been in rehab, thus empiric abx coverage will cover health care
   associated PNA. The patient also has been on a course of steroids, thus
   may be immunosuppressed. The patient has been afebrile since admission
   and does not have a leukocytosis. Thus making pulm fibrosis more
   likely. The patient is currently intubated on PCV + assist with good
   ABG. CXR shows diffuse opacities.
   - cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin day [**5-27**] for HCAP
   - continue steroids and NAC for now
   - ABG adequate, wean FiO2 and sedation as tolerated, q6h ABG
   - Daily wake up, consider SBT if tolerating well
   - Await cultures for  blood, sputum and mini BAL (even if negative
   continue course of abx)
   - CXR

   # Sedation: Patient was d/c from cisatracurium. Currently synchronous
   with vent.
   - decrease fentanyl

   # Bradycardic: Patient continues to be bradycardic in the 30
s. Unable
   to assess MS, however, good UOP, warm extremities, no signs of poor
   perfusion that we are able to measure. No treatment at this time.
   Continue to monitor. Consider atropine or pacing if needed. EKG showed

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted for shortness of breath, which is likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. The patient presented with worsening SOB (Shortness of Breath), increased O2 requirement, fever, chills, and leukocytosis. There is a concern for the development of PNA (Pneumonia) or worsening of fibrotic lung disease. The patient has been hospitalized in the last 30 days and has been in rehab, so empiric antibiotic coverage will cover healthcare-associated PNA. The patient has also been on a course of steroids, which may have immunosuppressed him. The patient's condition has improved since admission, and he does not currently have a fever or leukocytosis, making pulmonic fibrosis more likely. The patient is currently intubated on PCV+ assist with good ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) results. CXR (Chest X-ray) shows diffuse opacities. 

Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient continues to be bradycardic in the 30s. Decrease fentanyl, as it may be contributing to the bradycardia.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD/Ischemic Heart Disease): Continue ASA (Aspirin) and Plavix to manage CAD.
3. Respiratory Failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. The patient presented with SOB and increased O2 requirement, along with fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. He is currently intubated. The treatment plan includes continuing antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, steroids, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for IPF exacerbation, and weaning FiO2 and PEEP if the patient tolerates pressure support (PS). The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 38 bpm (bradycardia), blood pressure of 138/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) analysis indicates a pH of 7.48, indicating respiratory alkalosis. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds throughout, warm extremities, and no signs of poor perfusion. Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, bradycardia, inadequate urine output, and infections such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. The patient presented with SOB, increased oxygen requirement, fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. He is currently intubated.

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin) for healthcare-associated pneumonia, steroids, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and gradual weaning of the ventilator. Arterial blood gas (ABG) is being checked every 8 hours, and ventilator adjustments are being made as necessary. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be considered tomorrow if the patient tolerates pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) well. Cultures for blood, sputum, and mini bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are pending, and antibiotics will be continued even if the cultures are negative.

The patient's IPF is being managed with outpatient NAC and a trial of steroids.

The patient continues to be bradycardic, with a heart rate in the 30s. No treatment is currently being given for this, but the patient's warm extremities and good urine output suggest no signs"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia.
   # Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2
   requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently
   intubated on CPAP/PSV. Continues to be afebrile and without
   leukocytosis since admission.
   - Continue to wean ventilator as tolerated. Consider spontaneous
   breathing trial in 24 hrs, with pulmonary toilet in the interim.
   - Continue antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin day
   [**6-26**] for health care associated pneumonia
   - ABG q24hours, adjust vent as necessary
   - Sputum culture today--follow up results
   - CXR
   # Sedation: Initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on
   ventilator; paralytics d/c
d 3 days ago. Now on Fentanyl and Versed,
   with attempts to wean associated with agitation.  Unclear if agitation
   represents delirium vs. expression of his readiness to be weaned from
   intubation.
   -[**Month/Year (2) 7581**] interpreter today to assess delirium vs. cogent desire to be
   extubated.
   -Otherwise continue wean sedation as tolerated without excessive
   agitation.
   #Tube feed residuals: Persistent despite augmentation of bowel regimen.
   Although a pro-kinetic [**Doctor Last Name 23**] such as Reglan could be used to stimulate
   his GI tract, extubation would resolve this problem without the
   initiation of a potentially agitation-inducing medication.
   -If he remains intubated past Friday, we could consider starting
   Reglan.
   -Nurse to record residuals volume.
   # IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids may be appropriate.
   -Wean steroids by 10% after confirmation by pulm doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 549**].
   # Bradycardic: Patient continues to be bradycardic; baseline in
   outpatient setting is 50s. Consider atropine or pacing if signs of poor
   perfusion; otherwise, his HR will likely improve following weaning of
   sedation (especially Fentanyl).
   - Wean Fentanyl, as per above.
   # UOP: UO adequate yesterday.
   - Goal of >30cc/hour
   # CAD: Continue ASA, Plavix
   # FEN: Continue tube feeds Nutren Pulmonary

The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure/Pressure Support Ventilation) and has been sedated with Fentanyl and Versed.

The patient's recent events include being weaned from pressure control to pressure-support ventilation with stable ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) but development of apnea. The patient was then switched to mandatory minute ventilation/pressure support ventilation with continued stable ABG. Overnight, the patient was switched back to CPAP.

The patient's sedation was weaned, but due to agitation, it was increased again. The patient occasionally answers inappropriately and was able to nod his head during a conversation with the nurse interpreter.

The patient's UOP (Urine Output) has remained above 30 mL/hr. A bowel regimen was initiated for increased tube feed residuals and decreased bowel movements. However, no bowel movements occurred, and tube feed residuals are present.

The patient continues to experience persistent bradycardia despite decreased Fentanyl. A family meeting with social work is scheduled for today at 1 PM. The patient's allergies include ace inhibitors and angioedema. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Cefipime, Ciprofloxacin, and Vancomycin."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia.
   # Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2
   requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently
   intubated on CPAP/PSV. Continues to be afebrile and without
   leukocytosis since admission.
   - Continue to wean ventilator as tolerated. Consider spontaneous
   breathing trial in 24 hrs, with pulmonary toilet in the interim.
   - Continue antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin day
   [**6-26**] for health care associated pneumonia
   - ABG q24hours, adjust vent as necessary
   - Sputum culture today--follow up results
   - CXR
   # Sedation: Initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on
   ventilator; paralytics d/c
d 3 days ago. Now on Fentanyl and Versed,
   with attempts to wean associated with agitation.  Unclear if agitation
   represents delirium vs. expression of his readiness to be weaned from
   intubation.
   -[**Month/Year (2) 7581**] interpreter today to assess delirium vs. cogent desire to be
   extubated.
   -Otherwise continue wean sedation as tolerated without excessive
   agitation.
   #Tube feed residuals: Persistent despite augmentation of bowel regimen.
   Although a pro-kinetic [**Doctor Last Name 23**] such as Reglan could be used to stimulate
   his GI tract, extubation would resolve this problem without the
   initiation of a potentially agitation-inducing medication.
   -If he remains intubated past Friday, we could consider starting
   Reglan.
   -Nurse to record residuals volume.
   # IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids may be appropriate.
   -Wean steroids by 10% after confirmation by pulm doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 549**].
   # Bradycardic: Patient continues to be bradycardic; baseline in
   outpatient setting is 50s. Consider atropine or pacing if signs of poor
   perfusion; otherwise, his HR will likely improve following weaning of
   sedation (especially Fentanyl).
   - Wean Fentanyl, as per above.
   # UOP: UO adequate yesterday.
   - Goal of >30cc/hour
   # CAD: Continue ASA, Plavix
   # FEN: Continue tube feeds Nutren Pulmonary
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted for shortness of breath likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. He presented with respiratory failure and was intubated on CPAP/PSV. The patient has been afebrile and without leukocytosis since admission. He is currently sedated with Fentanyl and Versed, with attempts to wean associated with agitation. There is persistent bradycardia despite decreased Fentanyl. The patient's tube feed residuals are persistent despite augmentation of the bowel regimen. He is on outpatient NAC (N-acetylcysteine) and steroids for IPF. The patient's UOP (urine output) is adequate, and his goal is to maintain a UOP of >30cc/hour. He continues to receive medications for CAD (coronary artery disease), FEN (fluid electrolyte management), and prophylaxis for DVT (deep vein thrombosis), stress ulcers, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia). The patient's code status is full confirmation with the patient and his daughter. His disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with shortness of breath and increased O2 requirement, indicating respiratory distress. If the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is not appropriately managed, it could lead to further deterioration of lung function and potentially"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia.
    # Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2
   requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently
   intubated on CPAP/PSV. Continues to be afebrile and without
   leukocytosis since admission. Has tolerated weaning of ventilator with
   stable ABG. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7513**] rec
d PCP prophylaxis for immunosuppression
   from steroid use.
   - Continue to wean ventilator as tolerated.
   - Trial of extubation this afternoon with Farsi interpreter present.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia
   -Start Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis today.
   - ABG q24hours, adjust vent as necessary
   - Repeat sputum culture
   - CXR
   # Sedation: Initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on
   ventilator; paralytics d/c
d 3 days ago. Now on Fentanyl and Versed,
   with past attempts to wean associated with agitation.  MS appropriate
   yesterday with Farsi interpreter
agitation less likely due to delirium.
   Currently on Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr and Versed 6 mg/hr.
   -Continue wean sedation as tolerated without excessive agitation.
   #Tube feed residuals: Persistent despite augmentation of bowel regimen.
   Will hopefully resolve with extubation. If he remains intubation, we
   could consider a pro-kinetic [**Doctor Last Name 23**] such as Reglan.
   -Trial of extubation today, as per above.
   # IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids may be appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7513**]
   agrees.
   -Steroid taper steroid taper (150, 120, 100 QD), per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7513**]
   recs.
   # Bradycardic: Patient continues to be bradycardic; baseline in
   outpatient setting is 50s. Consider atropine or pacing if signs of poor
   perfusion; otherwise, his HR will likely improve following weaning of
   sedation (especially Fentanyl).
   -Continue to wean Fentanyl, as per above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. He presented with symptoms such as SOB, increased O2 requirement, fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure/Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation) and has tolerated weaning of the ventilator with stable ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) values. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if extubation does not go well.
2. Healthcare-associated Pneumonia: The patient is still on empiric antibiotics for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia.
3. Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for PCP due to immunosuppression from steroid use, and Bactrim prophylaxis has been started.
4. Delirium: The patient has agitation, which may be due to delirium, especially since he is on high-dose sedatives like Fentanyl. Sedation weaning should be done carefully to avoid excessive agitation.
5. Tube feed residuals: The patient has persistent tube feed residuals despite augmentation of bowel"

   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently
   intubated on CPAP/PSV. Continues to be afebrile and without
   leukocytosis since admission. Has tolerated weaning of ventilator with
   stable ABG. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**] rec
d PCP prophylaxis for immunosuppression
   from steroid use.
   - Continue to wean ventilator as tolerated.
   - SBP, with extubation this afternoon if appropriate.
   - Farsi interpreter to be present at the time of extubation
page prior
   to extubation.
   - Given baseline agitation/anxiety, consider Haldol if agitation occurs
   at the time of extubation.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia.
   -Start Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis today.
   - ABG after extubation.
   - CXR
   2) Sedation: Initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on
   ventilator; paralytics d/c
d 3 days ago. Now on Fentanyl and Versed,
   with past attempts to wean associated with agitation.  MS appropriate
   yesterday with Farsi interpreter
agitation less likely due to delirium.
   Currently on Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr and Versed 6 mg/hr. Because he has been
   on Versed for several days, there is concern for benzo withdrawal; we
   can consider CIWA protocol if withdrawal signs are apparent.
   -Continue wean sedation as tolerated, with goal of extubation today if
   appropriate.
   -Observe for benzo withdrawal.
   3) [**Month/Year (2) 1349**]: [**Month/Year (2) 7604**] UO adequate yesterday, but he was still positive 200mL

   from diuresis to optimize diuresis. He is Lasix-na
   -Start with Lasix 20 mg IV, with drip as need to a goal of -1L/24hr
   4) Tube feed residuals: Persistent despite augmentation of bowel
   regimen. Will hopefully resolve with extubation. If he remains
   intubated, we could consider a pro-kinetic [**Doctor Last Name 23**] such as Reglan.
   -Plan for extubation today, as per above.
   5) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
   agrees.
   -Steroid taper steroid taper 10 mg per day for 10 days to 40 mg, per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]

   6) Bradycardia: Patient continues to be bradycardic with some
   improvement; baseline in outpatient setting is 50s. Consider atropine
   or pacing if signs of poor perfusion; otherwise, his HR will likely
   improve following weaning of sedation (especially Fentanyl).
   -Continue to wean Fentanyl, as per above.
   7) CAD: Continue ASA, Plavix
   8) FEN:
   -D/C tube feeds for extubation today. NPO if extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has been intubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV. He has tolerated weaning of the ventilator with stable ABG and is afebrile and without leukocytosis since admission. The patient's sedation has been decreased, and he is following commands with the help of a Farsi interpreter. The doctor recommends a steroid taper and Bactrim for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement, along with fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. There is uncertainty regarding the etiology, likely IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient continues to be intubated and may face complications associated with mechanical ventilation.
2. Sedation: The patient has been sedated for dyschronous respiration on the ventilator but is currently on Fentanyl and Versed. There is concern for benzodiazepine withdrawal, and the patient may experience agitation or delirium during the weaning process.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance of 3.6 L and would benefit from diuresis to optimize fluid management.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently
   intubated on CPAP/PSV. Continues to be afebrile and without
   leukocytosis since admission. Has tolerated weaning of ventilator with
   stable ABG. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**] rec
d PCP prophylaxis for immunosuppression
   from steroid use.
   - Continue to wean ventilator as tolerated.
   - SBP, with extubation this afternoon if appropriate.
   - Farsi interpreter to be present at the time of extubation
page prior
   to extubation.
   - Given baseline agitation/anxiety, consider Haldol if agitation occurs
   at the time of extubation.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia.
   -Start Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis today.
   - ABG after extubation.
   - CXR
   2) Sedation: Initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on
   ventilator; paralytics d/c
d 3 days ago. Now on Fentanyl and Versed,
   with past attempts to wean associated with agitation.  MS appropriate
   yesterday with Farsi interpreter
agitation less likely due to delirium.
   Currently on Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr and Versed 6 mg/hr. Because he has been
   on Versed for several days, there is concern for benzo withdrawal; we
   can consider CIWA protocol if withdrawal signs are apparent.
   -Continue wean sedation as tolerated, with goal of extubation today if
   appropriate.
   -Observe for benzo withdrawal.

   #Tube feed residuals: Persistent despite augmentation of bowel regimen.
   Will hopefully resolve with extubation. If he remains intubated, we
   could consider a pro-kinetic [**Doctor Last Name 23**] such as Reglan.
   -Plan for extubation today, as per above.
   # IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
   agrees.

   # Bradycardic: Patient continues to be bradycardic with some
   improvement; baseline in outpatient setting is 50s. Consider atropine
   or pacing if signs of poor perfusion; otherwise, his HR will likely
   improve following weaning of sedation (especially Fentanyl).
   -Continue to wean Fentanyl, as per above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and intubated on CPAP/PSV. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2 requirement, which suggests respiratory failure. This is likely due to IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient has tolerated weaning of ventilator with stable ABG, indicating improvement. However, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed.

2. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP): The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for HCAP. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or treatment failure if the causative organism is resistant to the prescribed antibiotics.

3. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis: The patient is on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis due to immunosuppression from steroid use. If the patient's immune system becomes compromised, there is a risk of developing PCP.

4. Steroid taper: The patient is on a steroid taper. Abrupt discontinuation of steroids can lead to adrenal insufficiency and withdrawal symptoms.

5. Bradycardia: The patient continues to be bradycardic. If the bradycard"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV and has tolerated weaning of the ventilator with stable arterial blood gases (ABG). He is also sedated with Fentanyl and Versed. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure of 134/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's physical examination shows crackles bilaterally on anterior exam and edema of the upper and lower extremities.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement, suggesting respiratory failure. This could be due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV and has tolerated weaning of the ventilator with stable ABG. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and extubation failure.

2. Sedation: The patient is currently on Fentanyl and Versed for sedation. There is a concern for benzodiazepine withdrawal, so the CIWA protocol may be considered if withdrawal signs are apparent. Weaning of sedation should"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia.
   # Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2
   requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently
   intubated on CPAP/PSV. Continues to be afebrile and without
   leukocytosis since admission.
   - Continue to wean ventilator as tolerated. Consider spontaneous
   breathing trial in 24 hrs, with pulmonary toilet in the interim.
   - Continue antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin day
   [**6-26**] for health care associated pneumonia
   - ABG q24hours, adjust vent as necessary
   - Sputum culture today--follow up results
   - CXR
   # Sedation: Initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on
   ventilator; paralytics d/c
d 3 days ago. Now on Fentanyl and Versed,
   with attempts to wean associated with agitation.  Unclear if agitation
   represents delirium vs. expression of his readiness to be weaned from
   intubation.
   -Farsi interpreter today to assess delirium vs. cogent desire to be
   extubated.
   -Otherwise continue wean sedation as tolerated without excessive
   agitation.
   #Tube feed residuals: Persistent despite augmentation of bowel regimen.
   Although a pro-kinetic [**Doctor Last Name 23**] such as Reglan could be used to stimulate
   his GI tract, extubation would resolve this problem without the
   initiation of a potentially agitation-inducing medication.
   -If he remains intubated past Friday, we could consider starting
   Reglan.
   -Nurse to record residuals volume.
   # IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids may be appropriate.
   -Wean steroids by 10% after confirmation by pulm doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 549**].
   # Bradycardic: Patient continues to be bradycardic; baseline in
   outpatient setting is 50s. Consider atropine or pacing if signs of poor
   perfusion; otherwise, his HR will likely improve following weaning of
   sedation (especially Fentanyl).
   - Wean Fentanyl, as per above.
   # UOP: UO adequate yesterday.
   - Goal of >30cc/hour
   # CAD: Continue ASA, Plavix
   # FEN: Continue tube feeds Nutren Pulmonary
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   # Access: peripherals, R IJ triple lumen, L A-line

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure/Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Breath) and is showing signs of improvement as he is afebrile and without leukocytosis since admission.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2 requirement with fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. It is unclear etiology, likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV. Continues to be afebrile and without leukocytosis since admission. The plan is to continue weaning the ventilator as tolerated and consider a spontaneous breathing trial in 24 hours, with pulmonary toilet in the interim.

2. Sedation: Initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on ventilator; paralytics were discontinued 3 days ago. Now on Fentanyl and Versed, with attempts to wean associated with agitation. It is unclear if agitation represents delirium vs. expression of his readiness to be weaned from intubation. A Farsi interpreter will be available today to"

   -Trial of extubation today, as per above.
   # IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient presented with SOB and increased O2 requirement, along with fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. The etiology is unclear, but it is likely an IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient has been intubated on CPAP/PSV and has tolerated weaning of the ventilator with stable arterial blood gases (ABG). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. It is important to continue weaning the ventilator as tolerated and monitor ABG q24hours to adjust vent as necessary.
2. Sedation: The patient has been sedated due to agitation during previous attempts to wean. It is necessary to continue weaning sedation as tolerated without excessive agitation.
3. Tube Feed Residuals: The patient has persistent tube feed residuals despite augmentation of bowel regimen. This may resolve with extubation. If the patient remains intubated, considering a prokinetic agent such as Reglan may be appropriate.
4. IPF Exacerbation: The patient has IPF and is on outpatient N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and steroids. Weaning steroids may be appropriate, considering"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently
   intubated on CPAP/PSV. Continues to be afebrile and without
   leukocytosis since admission. Has tolerated weaning of ventilator with
   stable ABG. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**] rec
d PCP prophylaxis for immunosuppression
   from steroid use.
   - Continue to wean ventilator as tolerated.
   - SBP, with extubation this afternoon if appropriate.
   - Farsi interpreter to be present at the time of extubation
page prior
   to extubation.
   - Given baseline agitation/anxiety, consider Haldol if agitation occurs
   at the time of extubation.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia.
   -Start Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis today.
   - ABG after extubation.
   - CXR
   2) Sedation: Initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on
   ventilator; paralytics d/c
d 3 days ago. Now on Fentanyl and Versed,
   with past attempts to wean associated with agitation.  MS appropriate
   yesterday with Farsi interpreter
agitation less likely due to delirium.
   Currently on Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr and Versed 6 mg/hr. Because he has been
   on Versed for several days, there is concern for benzo withdrawal; we
   can consider CIWA protocol if withdrawal signs are apparent.
   -Continue wean sedation as tolerated, with goal of extubation today if
   appropriate.
   -Observe for benzo withdrawal.
   3) [**Month/Year (2) 1349**]: [**Month/Year (2) 7604**] UO adequate yesterday, but he was still positive 200mL
   in the past 24hr, with LOS fluid balance of 3.6 L. He would benefit
   from diuresis to optimize diuresis. He is Lasix-na
   -Start with Lasix 20 mg IV, with drip as need to a goal of -1L/24hr
   4) Tube feed residuals: Persistent despite augmentation of bowel
   regimen. Will hopefully resolve with extubation. If he remains
   intubated, we could consider a pro-kinetic [**Doctor Last Name 23**] such as Reglan.
   -Plan for extubation today, as per above.
   5) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
   agrees.
   -Steroid taper steroid taper 10 mg per day for 10 days to 40 mg, per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recs.
   6) Bradycardia: Patient continues to be bradycardic with some
   improvement; baseline in outpatient setting is 50s. Consider atropine
   or pacing if signs of poor perfusion; otherwise, his HR will likely
   improve following weaning of sedation (especially Fentanyl).
   -Continue to wean Fentanyl, as per above.
   7) CAD: Continue ASA, Plavix
   8) FEN:
   -D/C tube feeds for extubation today. NPO if extubated.
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control
   9) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   10) Access: peripherals, R IJ triple lumen, L A-line

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient is currently intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation due to respiratory failure. The initial assessment suggests that the patient's symptoms are likely due to an IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient has tolerated weaning of the ventilator with stable ABG values.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure if not properly weaned off the ventilator or if there is a worsening of his underlying IPF condition.

2. Delirium/Agitation: The patient has shown baseline agitation/anxiety, and there is a concern for delirium, especially during the process of extubation. Haldol may be considered if agitation occurs at the time of extubation.

3. Benzodiazepine Withdrawal: The patient has been on Versed for several days, and there is a concern for benzodiazepine withdrawal. The CIWA protocol may be considered if withdrawal signs are apparent.

4. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance of 3.6 L, indicating fluid overload. Lasix 20 mg IV has been started to optimize diuresis and achieve a goal of -1 L/24hr fluid balance.

5. Tube Feed Residuals: The patient's tube feed residuals remain persistent despite augmentation of the bowel regimen. If the patient remains intubated, a pro-kinetic agent such as Reglan may be considered.

6. IPF Exacerbation: The patient's IPF exacerbation needs to be closely monitored, and steroid tapering should be continued as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]'s recommendations.

7. Bradycardia: The patient continues to be bradycardic, and atropine or pacing may be considered if signs of poor perfusion occur. The patient's heart rate is expected to improve following weaning of sedation, especially Fentanyl.

8. Cardiovascular Disease (CAD): The patient's CAD should be continued on ASA and Plavix.

9. Feeding: The patient's tube feeds will be discontinued for extubation today. If the patient is extubated, he will be NPO.

10. Prophylaxis: The patient will continue on subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, and SCD for prophylaxis.

11. Access: The patient currently has peripheral lines, a right internal jugular triple lumen line, and a left arterial line.

12. Code Status: The patient has a confirmed code status with the patient and daughter.

13. Communication: The patient's communication status is full, and the contact information for the patient and daughter is provided.

14. Disposition: The patient's disposition is pending above.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the provided progress note include respiratory failure, delirium/agitation, benzodiazepine withdrawal, fluid overload, tube feed residuals, IPF exacerbation, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, feeding, prophylaxis, access, code status, communication, and disposition."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated yesterday with
   stable ABG. On facemask 60% FiO2. Continues to be afebrile, now with
   mild leukocytosis. No CXR today.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia and Bactrim
   day 2 for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**].
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -Follow up on AM ABG.
   -Speech and swallow consult. NPO pending consult.
   - PT consult .
   2) Blood-tinged urine with Foley. Differential diagnosis includes UTI,
   ATN, mechanical injury with Foley. Last U/A was [**2189-7-18**]. He has a
   slightly increased WBC. BUN and Cr stable.
   -UA and UCx
   3) HTN: Off of home Imdur 60 mg PO. SBP to 185, responded well to
   Hydralazine 5 mg IV.
   -Restart Imdur 30 mg PO pending speech and swallow
   4) UOP: Adequate yesterday, with total LOS fluid balance of -750 mL
   with Lasix 20 mg IV and apparent autodiuresis following extubation.
   Will likely continue to autodiurese, but we can use Lasix as needed to
   reach UOP goal.
   -Goal of  -1L/24hr fluid balance today.
   -Consider Lasix 20 mL IV x1 if needed to achieve fluid balance goal.
   5) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation
   6) Elevated LDH. LDH was 394 on [**2189-7-16**], 363 on [**2189-7-23**]. Differential
   diagnosis includes anemia of chronic disease and accumulative effect of
   steroids, antibiotics, and/or opiates. Liver disease less likely given
   stable and normal transaminases. Hypoperfusion less likely given normal
   lactic acid. Will withhold intervention at this time and will continue
   to monitor.
   -Trend LDH.
   7) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
   agrees. PO acetylcysteine held.
   -Continue steroid taper steroid taper 10 mg per day for 10 days to 30
   mg IV Q8H, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recs.
   -Will need to restart NAC PO pending speech and swallow recs.
   8) Constipation: KUB on [**2189-7-21**] without obstruction. Continues to not
   have bowel movement. Bowel sounds present.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   9) Bradycardia: Resolved following weaning off of sedation and
   extubation. Will continue to monitor.
   7) CAD:
   -Continue ASA, Plavix.
   -Restart Imdur 30 mg PO pending speech and swallow evaluation, as per
   above.
   -Held PO atorvastatin due to NPO. Will restart pending speech and
   swallow evaluation, as per above.
   8) FEN:
   -NPO pending speech and swallow today. Consider NG tube placement if
   fails speech and swallow.
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control
   9) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   10) Access: peripherals, R IJ triple lumen, L A-line

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated yesterday with
   stable ABG. On facemask 60% FiO2. Continues to be afebrile, now with
   mild leukocytosis. No CXR today.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia and Bactrim
   day 2 for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**].
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -Follow up on AM ABG.
   -Speech and swallow consult. NPO pending consult.
   - PT consult .
   2) Blood-tinged urine with Foley. Differential diagnosis includes UTI,
   ATN, mechanical injury with Foley. Last U/A was [**2189-7-18**]. He has a
   slightly increased WBC. BUN and Cr stable.
   -UA and UCx
   3) HTN: Off of home Imdur 60 mg PO. SBP to 185, responded well to
   Hydralazine 5 mg IV.
   -Restart Imdur 30 mg PO pending speech and swallow
   4) UOP: Adequate yesterday, with total LOS fluid balance of -750 mL
   with Lasix 20 mg IV and apparent autodiuresis following extubation.
   Will likely continue to autodiurese, but we can use Lasix as needed to
   reach UOP goal.
   -Goal of  -1L/24hr fluid balance today.
   -Consider Lasix 20 mL IV x1 if needed to achieve fluid balance goal.
   5) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation
   6) Elevated LDH. LDH was 394 on [**2189-7-16**], 363 on [**2189-7-23**]. Differential
   diagnosis includes anemia of chronic disease and accumulative effect of
   steroids, antibiotics, and/or opiates. Liver disease less likely given
   stable and normal transaminases. Hypoperfusion less likely given normal
   lactic acid. Will withhold intervention at this time and will continue
   to monitor.
   -Trend LDH.
   7) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
   agrees. PO acetylcysteine held.
   -Continue steroid taper steroid taper 10 mg per day for 10 days to 30
   mg IV Q8H, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recs.
   -Will need to restart NAC PO pending speech and swallow recs.
   8) Constipation: KUB on [**2189-7-21**] without obstruction. Continues to not
   have bowel movement. Bowel sounds present.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   9) Bradycardia: Resolved following weaning off of sedation and
   extubation. Will continue to monitor.
   10) CAD:
   -Continue ASA, Plavix.
   -Restart Imdur 30 mg PO pending speech and swallow evaluation, as per
   above.
   -Held PO atorvastatin due to NPO. Will restart pending speech and
   swallow evaluation, as per above.
   11) FEN:
   -NPO pending speech and swallow today. Consider NG tube placement if
   fails speech and swallow.
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control
   12) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   13) Access: peripherals, R IJ triple lumen, L A-line
   14) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient was extubated yesterday with stable ABG on facemask 60% FiO2. He continues to be afebrile with mild leukocytosis. There is no chest X-ray today.

The patient's blood-tinged urine is being evaluated for possible urinary tract infection (UTI), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or mechanical injury from the Foley catheter. His blood pressure is well-controlled with hydralazine IV, and his fluid balance is being closely monitored.

The patient has received medications for agitation, including haloperidol, and is on empiric antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia. His steroid dose is being tapered as per the recommendation of Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 549]. The patient's elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are being monitored.

The patient's IPF treatment plan includes continuing N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and tapering steroids. He is also onASA, Plavix, and held PO atorvastatin. The patient's constipation is being managed with a bowel regimen.

The patient's code status is full code, and his communication and disposition are pending."

   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated yesterday with
   stable ABG. On facemask 100% FiO2. Continues to be afebrile, now with
   mild leukocytosis.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia.
   -Start Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis today.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated

   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID:PRN agitation
   5) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]

   6) Bradycardia: Patient continues to be bradycardic with some
   improvement; baseline in outpatient setting is 50s. Consider atropine
   or pacing if signs of poor perfusion; otherwise, his HR will likely
   improve following weaning of sedation (especially Fentanyl).

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis. He is currently extubated and on a facemask with 100% FiO2. The patient has been receiving empiric antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, as well as Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. His ABG values are stable, but he has blood-tinged urine, which may be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or mechanical injury from the Foley catheter. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he has a slightly increased white blood cell count (WBC). His fluid balance is positive at 3.6 liters, indicating fluid overload, and he would benefit from diuresis. The patient is also experiencing agitation, which has improved with haloperidol. His IPF treatment, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and steroids, is being weaned off due to lack of compelling evidence for their use in this patient. The patient's bradycardia is being monitored, and atropine or pacing may be considered if signs of poor perfusion occur. His history of coronary artery disease (CAD) is being managed with aspirin and Plavix. The patient's feeding status is being"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated yesterday with
   stable ABG. On facemask 60% FiO2. Continues to be afebrile, now with
   mild leukocytosis. No CXR today.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia and Bactrim
   day 2 for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**].
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -Follow up on AM ABG.
   -Speech and swallow consult. NPO pending consult.
   - PT consult .
   2) Blood-tinged urine with Foley. Differential diagnosis includes UTI,
   ATN, mechanical injury with Foley. Last U/A was [**2189-7-18**]. He has a
   slightly increased WBC. BUN and Cr stable.
   -UA and UCx
   3) HTN: Off of home Imdur 60 mg PO. SBP to 185, responded well to
   Hydralazine 5 mg IV.
   -Restart Imdur 30 mg PO pending speech and swallow
   4) UOP: Adequate yesterday, with total LOS fluid balance of -750 mL
   with Lasix 20 mg IV and apparent autodiuresis following extubation.
   Will likely continue to autodiurese, but we can use Lasix as needed to
   reach UOP goal.
   -Goal of  -1L/24hr fluid balance today.
   -Consider Lasix 20 mL IV x1 if needed to achieve fluid balance goal.
   5) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation
   6) Elevated LDH. LDH was 394 on [**2189-7-16**], 363 on [**2189-7-23**]. Differential
   diagnosis includes anemia of chronic disease and accumulative effect of
   steroids, antibiotics, and/or opiates. Liver disease less likely given
   stable and normal transaminases. Hypoperfusion less likely given normal
   lactic acid. Will withhold intervention at this time and will continue
   to monitor.
   -Trend LDH.
   7) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
   agrees. PO acetylcysteine held.
   -Continue steroid taper steroid taper 10 mg per day for 10 days to 30
   mg IV Q8H, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recs.
   -Will need to restart NAC PO pending speech and swallow recs.
   8) Constipation: KUB on [**2189-7-21**] without obstruction. Continues to not
   have bowel movement. Bowel sounds present.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   9) Bradycardia: Resolved following weaning off of sedation and
   extubation. Will continue to monitor.
   10) CAD:
   -Continue ASA, Plavix.
   -Restart Imdur 30 mg PO pending speech and swallow evaluation, as per
   above.
   -Held PO atorvastatin due to NPO. Will restart pending speech and
   swallow evaluation, as per above.
   11) FEN:
   -NPO pending speech and swallow today. Consider NG tube placement if
   fails speech and swallow.
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control
   12) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   13) Access: peripherals, R IJ triple lumen, L A-line

","The patient is a 76-year-old man with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis included IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. He was extubated yesterday with stable arterial blood gas (ABG) and is currently on a facemask with 60% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient received Lasix 20 mL IV, decreased steroids by 10 mg per day as suggested by Dr. [**Last Name (NI) 7618**], started bactrim, and received Zofran for nausea, hydralazine for hypertension, and Haldol for agitation. He also has blood-tinged urine, which could be due to urinary tract infection (UTI), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or mechanical injury from the Foley catheter.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now with extubation.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently
   intubated on CPAP/PSV. Continues to be afebrile and without
   leukocytosis since admission. Has tolerated weaning of ventilator with
   stable ABG. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**] rec
d PCP prophylaxis for immunosuppression
   from steroid use.
   - Continue to wean ventilator as tolerated.
   - SBP, with extubation this afternoon if appropriate.
   - Farsi interpreter to be present at the time of extubation
page prior
   to extubation.
   - Given baseline agitation/anxiety, consider Haldol if agitation occurs
   at the time of extubation.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia.
   -Start Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis today.
   - ABG after extubation.
   - CXR
   2) Sedation: Initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on
   ventilator; paralytics d/c
d 3 days ago. Now on Fentanyl and Versed,
   with past attempts to wean associated with agitation.  MS appropriate
   yesterday with Farsi interpreter
agitation less likely due to delirium.
   Currently on Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr and Versed 6 mg/hr. Because he has been
   on Versed for several days, there is concern for benzo withdrawal; we
   can consider CIWA protocol if withdrawal signs are apparent.
   -Continue wean sedation as tolerated, with goal of extubation today if
   appropriate.
   -Observe for benzo withdrawal.
   3) UOP: Hourly UO adequate yesterday, but he was still positive 200mL
   in the past 24hr, with LOS fluid balance of 3.6 L. He would benefit
   from diuresis to optimize diuresis. He is Lasix-na
   -Start with Lasix 20 mg IV, with drip as need to a goal of -1L/24hr
   4) Tube feed residuals: Persistent despite augmentation of bowel
   regimen. Will hopefully resolve with extubation. If he remains
   intubated, we could consider a pro-kinetic [**Doctor Last Name 23**] such as Reglan.
   -Plan for extubation today, as per above.
   5) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
   agrees.
   -Steroid taper steroid taper 10 mg per day for 10 days to 40 mg, per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recs.
   6) Bradycardia: Patient continues to be bradycardic with some
   improvement; baseline in outpatient setting is 50s. Consider atropine
   or pacing if signs of poor perfusion; otherwise, his HR will likely
   improve following weaning of sedation (especially Fentanyl).
   -Continue to wean Fentanyl, as per above.
   7) CAD: Continue ASA, Plavix
   8) FEN:
   -D/C tube feeds for extubation today. NPO if extubated.
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control
   9) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   10) Access: peripherals, R IJ triple lumen, L A-line
   11) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis, concerning for IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient was intubated and placed on CPAP/PSV due to respiratory failure. He has since become afebrile and leukocytosis has resolved. The patient tolerated weaning off the ventilator with stable ABG results. The decision was made to extubate the patient, but he experienced desaturation during the process and required the use of a facemask with 100% O2. 

The patient's current medications include IV lasix, decreased steroids by 10 mg per day as per Dr.'s recommendation, bactrim for PCP prophylaxis, and the continuation of cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin for healthcare-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2 requirement, indicating potential respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV and has tolerated weaning of the ventilator with stable ABG results.

2. Sedation: The patient was initially on paralytics for dysnchronous respiration on the ventilator and is now on Fentanyl and Versed. There is concern for benzodiazepine withdrawal, and the CI"

   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated yesterday with
   stable ABG. On facemask 60% FiO2. Continues to be afebrile, with mild
   leukocytosis yesterday.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**7-27**] for health care associated pneumonia and Bactrim
   day 2 for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**].
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -Follow up on AM ABG.
   -Speech and swallow consult. NPO pending consult.
   - PT consult .
   2) Blood-tinged urine with Foley. Differential diagnosis includes
   glomerulonephritis, ATN, mechanical injury with Foley. UTI less likely.
   -Check urine electrolytes
   3) HTN: Off of home Imdur 60 mg PO. SBP to 185, responded well to
   Hydralazine 5 mg IV.
   -Restart Imdur 30 mg PO pending speech and swallow
   4) UOP: Adequate yesterday, with total LOS fluid balance of -750 mL
   with Lasix 20 mg IV and apparent autodiuresis following extubation.
   Will likely continue to autodiurese, but we can use Lasix as needed to
   reach UOP goal.
   -Goal of  -1L/24hr fluid balance today.
   -Consider Lasix 20 mL IV x1 if needed to achieve fluid balance goal.
   5) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation
   6) Elevated LDH. LDH was 394 on [**2189-7-16**], 363 on [**2189-7-23**]. Differential
   diagnosis includes anemia of chronic disease, hypoperfusion, and
   accumulative effect of steroids, antibiotics, and/or opiates. Liver
   disease less likely given stable and normal transaminases. Will
   withhold intervention at this time and will continue to monitor. Last
   lactate was 0.9 on [**2189-7-22**].
   -Continue trending LDH.
   -Check lactate.
   7) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
   agrees. PO acetylcysteine held.
   -Continue steroid taper steroid taper 10 mg per day for 10 days to 30
   mg IV Q8H, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]

   -Will need to restart NAC PO pending speech and swallow recs.
   8) Constipation: KUB on [**2189-7-21**] without obstruction. Continues to not
   have bowel movement. Bowel sounds present.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   9) Bradycardia: Resolved following weaning off of sedation and
   extubation. Will continue to monitor.
   10) CAD:
   -Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated yesterday with
   stable ABG. On facemask 60% FiO2, with most recent ABGs showing
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and respiratory alkalosis. Also
   concerning is the risk of aspiration in the setting of
   emesis/wretching. At this point, he has been able to maintain the work
   of breathing, and O2 sat is generally >/=92%. Continues to be afebrile,
   with mild leukocytosis yesterday.
   -Repeat ABG, given lack of concordance of O2 sat and PaO2 and proximity
   to tussive event.
   -CXR this AM given emesis/wretching to rule out aspiration.
   - If ABG shows PaO2 <60, increase FiO2 to reduce hypoxic respiratory
   drive. Subsequently wean as tolerated. Consider noninvasive ventilation
   with BIPAP he cannot maintain work of breathing.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day [**8-27**] for health care associated pneumonia and Bactrim
   day 3 for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**].
   4) UOP: Adequate yesterday without Lasix. Given currently negative  LOS
   fluid balance of -1.6L , no indication for Lasix today.
   -Goal of  30cc/hr today.
   6) Elevated LDH. LDH was 394 on [**2189-7-16**], 363 on [**2189-7-23**]. Differential
   diagnosis includes infection, hemolysis, hypoperfusion, and
   accumulative effect of steroids, antibiotics, and/or opiates. Mild
   leukocytosis yesterday. Normal tbili and stable Hct yesterday make
   hemolysis less likely.  Liver disease less likely given stable and
   normal transaminases. Last lactate was 0.9 on [**2189-7-22**].
   -Continue trending LDH.
   -Check lactate and CBC.
   7) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition.
   -Diet, as per above.
   -Vitamin K
   5) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation
   3) HTN: Off of home Imdur 60 mg PO. SBP to 185, responded well to
   Hydralazine 5 mg IV.
   -Restart Imdur 30 mg PO pending speech and swallow
   2) Blood-tinged urine with Foley. Differential diagnosis includes
   mechanical injury with Foley, glomerulonephritis, ATN. UTI less likely.
   -Will check CBC today as per above.
   7) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Given lack of compelling
   evidence for use of steroids in this patient and his risk of
   delirium/agitation, weaning steroids is appropriate; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
   agrees. PO acetylcysteine held.
   -Continue steroid taper steroid taper 10 mg per day for 10 days to 30
   mg IV Q8H, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recs.
   -Will need to restart NAC PO pending speech and swallow recs.
   8) Constipation: KUB without obstruction. Large BM this AM.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   9) Bradycardia: Resolved following weaning off of sedation and
   extubation. Will continue to monitor.
   10) CAD:
   -Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin
   11) FEN:
   -NPO pending
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control
   12) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   13) Access: peripherals, R IJ triple lumen, L A-line
   14) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
   15) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**]
   16) Disposition: pending above. MACU may provide more appropriate level
   of nursing than gen med floor.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis suspected to be IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient presented with SOB and increased O2 requirement with fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology, likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated yesterday with stable ABG. On facemask 60% FiO2, with most recent ABGs showing worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and respiratory alkalosis. Also concerning is the risk of aspiration in the setting of emesis/wretching. At this point, he has been able to maintain the work of breathing, and O2 sat is generally >/=92%. Continues to be afebrile, with mild leukocytosis yesterday.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to the worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and respiratory alkalosis. Close monitoring and adjustment of FiO2 and noninvasive ventilation may be necessary.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the risk of aspiration in the setting of emesis/wretching, there is a possibility of developing aspiration pneumonia. Appropriate measures should be taken to minimize the risk of aspiration.

3. Healthcare-associated Pneumonia"

   alternate means of nutrition, hydration, and medications over the
   weekend. Essential meds may be given crushed with puree, strictly NPO
   if status worsens. Speech and swallow will re-evaluate next week. His
   nurse said that he is more alert than when evaluated by speech and
   swallow this AM and tolerated meds crushed in thick
   liquid/puree--suggested team re-evaluate this PM whether he needs an NG
   tube placement vs. can tolerate slow advancement of diet.
   --Started Imdur 30 mg PO yesterday with improvement to hypertension.
   --Received Zofran for nausea. Overnight, developed cramping abdominal
   pain without tenderness to palpation after several hours dry heaves.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving
   respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated 2 days ago and
   is currently on facemask 60% FiO2. Most recent ABGs shows worsening
   hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis, but it was performed during a
   desaturation event following a tussive episode and lacks concordance
   with SpO2 trends of >90%. Moreover, on physical exam, he has been able
   to maintain the work of breathing. Following O2 saturation may be more
   instructive than ABGs given his lack of hypercarbia. He continues to be
   afebrile, with mild leukocytosis yesterday.
   --Check CBC to trend WBCs.
   -- D/C empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin
   day (received day [**8-27**] for health care associated pneumonia) given no
   evidence of pneumonia.
   -- Continue Bactrim day 3 for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**].
   --ABG and CXR prn changing clinical status.
   2) Diet: Currently NPO except for crushed meds in puree, which he has
   tolerated. Daughter prefers that NG tubes should be viewed as last
   resort. Because he is more alert than when evaluated by speech and
   swallow and since he has tolerated meds in puree, he will likely
   tolerate advancing his diet to thick foods/purees. Speech and swallow
   will re-evaluate on Monday.
   --Advance to dysphagia diet.
   3) Blood-tinged urine with Foley. Differential diagnosis includes
   mechanical injury with Foley, glomerulonephritis, ATN, and UTI. UTI
   less likely given normal UA. Glomerulonephritis and ATN less likely
   given normal Cr and UOP.
   -Monitor UOP, with goal of 30cc/hr.
   -Will check CBC today as per above to trend Hct.
   4) UOP: Adequate auto-diuresis yesterday without Lasix. Given currently
   negative LOS fluid balance of -1.6L, no evidence of overload on CXR,
   and no peripheral edema , there is no indication for aggressive
   diuresis today.
   -Goal of  30cc/hr today, as per above.
   5) Elevated LDH: Trending up, with LDH of 394 on [**2189-7-16**] and 363 on
   [**2189-7-23**]. Differential diagnosis includes infection, hemolysis,
   hypoperfusion, and accumulative effect of steroids, antibiotics, and/or
   opiates. Mild leukocytosis yesterday. Normal Tbili and stable Hct
   yesterday make hemolysis less likely.  Stable and normal transaminases
   yesterday make liver pathology less likely. Last lactate was 0.9 on
   [**2189-7-22**].
   -Continue trending LDH.
   -Check CBC, as per above.
   6) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition.
   -Advance diet, as per above.
   -Consider vitamin K for further increases of INR and/or decreasing
   heparin SC from 5000 units TID to [**Hospital1 **] for further prolongation of PTT
   if coags do not resolve with dietary advancement.
   7) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   8) HTN: SBP 172 on Imdur 30 mg PO. He would likely benefit from further
   control with his home dose of Imdur 60 mg PO.
   -Increase Imdur to 60 mg PO  .
   9) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Tapering steroids per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10 days to 40 mg.
   -Continue methylprednisolone at 30 mg IV Q8H today; decrease by 10 mg
   tomorrow.
   -Continue NAC PO .
   10) Constipation: KUB without obstruction. Large BM this AM.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   11) Bradycardia: Resolved following weaning off of sedation and
   extubation. Will continue to monitor.
   10) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   11) FEN:
   -Dysphagia diet, as per above.
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis.
- The patient has been extubated and is currently on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status.
- The differential diagnosis includes IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia.
- The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 138/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- The patient's laboratory results show mild leukocytosis, elevated LDH levels, and prolonged PT/PTT. The urinalysis shows blood on dipstick with no evidence of infection or obstruction.
- The patient's diet has been advanced to a dysphagia diet, and he is currently NPO except for crushed medications given in puree form.
- The patient's blood-tinged urine is being monitored, with a goal of maintaining adequate urine output.
- The patient's elevated blood pressure is being managed with medication.
- The patient's agitation is being controlled with Haloperidol as needed.
- The patient's medications include N-acetylcysteine (NAC), methylprednisolone, imdur, ASA, Plavix, atorvastatin, famotidine, and heparin sodium.
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening hypoxemia or respiratory distress.
2. Pneumonia: Despite the absence of fever and leukocytosis, there is still a possibility of pneumonia given the patient's immunocompromised state due to IPF and steroid therapy.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and underlying cardiovascular disease. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin and sequential compression devices (SCD) should be continued.
4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient should continue to receive stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient is no longer on mechanical ventilation, VAP remains a concern, especially if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
6. Constipation: The patient's recent large bowel movement suggests that he is at risk for constipation. A bowel regimen should be continued to prevent this complication.
7. Bradycardia: The patient's resolved bradycardia should be monitored for any recurrence, particularly after weaning off sedation and extubation.
8. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure should"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient has been extubated and is currently on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and ABG analysis may be helpful in assessing oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: Despite being afebrile, there is still a possibility of infection due to leukocytosis. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and adjust the treatment accordingly.
3. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient is currently NPO except for crushed medications in puree, which he has tolerated. However, there is a concern for possible constipation given the lack of bowel movement in 10 days. Monitoring UOP and providing a bowel regimen may help manage this issue.
4. Blood-Tinged Urine: The presence of blood-tinged urine may indicate mechanical injury with Foley catheterization, glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or urinary tract infection (UTI). Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the cause.

   Imaging:
   KUB on 8/70/09: Non-specific bowel gas pattern. Stool in rectal vault,
   air throughout indicating no obstruction.
   CXR on [**2189-7-24**]: No interval change in diffuse parenchymal opacities. No
   increase in pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving
   respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated 2 days ago and
   is currently on facemask 60% FiO2. Most recent ABGs shows worsening
   hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis, but it was performed during a
   desaturation event following a tussive episode and lacks concordance
   with SpO2 trends of >90%. Moreover, on physical exam, he has been able
   to maintain the work of breathing. Following O2 saturation may be more
   instructive than ABGs given his lack of hypercarbia. He continues to be
   afebrile, with mild leukocytosis yesterday.
   --Check CBC to trend WBCs.
   -- D/C empiric antibiotics of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin
   day (received day [**8-27**] for health care associated pneumonia) given no
   evidence of pneumonia.
   -- Continue Bactrim day 3 for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**].
   --ABG and CXR prn changing clinical status.
   2) Diet: Currently NPO except for crushed meds in puree, which he has
   tolerated. Daughter prefers that NG tubes should be viewed as last
   resort. Because he is more alert than when evaluated by speech and
   swallow and since he has tolerated meds in puree, he will likely
   tolerate advancing his diet to thick foods/purees. Speech and swallow
   will re-evaluate on Monday.
   --Advance to dysphagia diet.
   3) Blood-tinged urine with Foley. Differential diagnosis includes
   mechanical injury with Foley, glomerulonephritis, ATN, and UTI. UTI
   less likely given normal UA. Glomerulonephritis and ATN less likely
   given normal Cr and UOP.
   -Monitor UOP, with goal of 30cc/hr.
   -Will check CBC today as per above to trend Hct.
   4) UOP: Adequate auto-diuresis yesterday without Lasix. Given currently
   negative LOS fluid balance of -1.6L, no evidence of overload on CXR,
   and no peripheral edema , there is no indication for aggressive
   diuresis today.
   -Goal of  30cc/hr today, as per above.
   5) Elevated LDH: Trending up, with LDH of 394 on [**2189-7-16**] and 363 on
   [**2189-7-23**]. Differential diagnosis includes infection, hemolysis,
   hypoperfusion, and accumulative effect of steroids, antibiotics, and/or
   opiates. Mild leukocytosis yesterday. Normal Tbili and stable Hct
   yesterday make hemolysis less likely.  Stable and normal transaminases
   yesterday make liver pathology less likely. Last lactate was 0.9 on
   [**2189-7-22**].
   -Continue trending LDH.
   -Check CBC, as per above.
   6) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition.
   -Advance diet, as per above.
   -Consider vitamin K for further increases of INR and/or decreasing
   heparin SC from 5000 units TID to [**Hospital1 **] for further prolongation of PTT
   if coags do not resolve with dietary advancement.
   7) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   8) HTN: SBP 172 on Imdur 30 mg PO. He would likely benefit from further
   control with his home dose of Imdur 60 mg PO.
   -Increase Imdur to 60 mg PO  .
   9) IPF: On outpatient NAC and steroids. Tapering steroids per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10 days to 40 mg.
   -Continue methylprednisolone at 30 mg IV Q8H today; decrease by 10 mg
   tomorrow.
   -Continue NAC PO .
   10) Constipation: KUB without obstruction. Large BM this AM.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   11) Bradycardia: Resolved following weaning off of sedation and
   extubation. Will continue to monitor.
   10) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   11) FEN:
   -Dysphagia diet, as per above.
   - Continue ISS for glycemic control.
   12) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   13) Access: peripherals, R IJ triple lumen, L A-line
   14) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter

","Summary:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and leukocytosis suspected to be IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia.
- The patient was extubated two days ago and is currently on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status.
- His recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows worsening hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis, but it was performed during a desaturation event following a coughing episode and lacks concordance with SpO2 trends of >90%.
- The patient is afebrile, with mild leukocytosis yesterday.
- The patient has blood-tinged urine with Foley, which may be due to mechanical injury with Foley, glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or urinary tract infection (UTI). UTI is less likely given normal urinalysis (UA).
- The patient's urine output (UOP) is adequate without Lasix, with a goal of 30cc/hr today.
- The patient's lactate level was 0.9 on [**2189-7-22**].
- The patient's elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is trending up, but normal Tbilli and stable hematocrit (Hct) yesterday make hemolysis less likely.
- The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT)"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving
   respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He was extubated 3 days ago and
   was stable most of yesterday on 60% FiO2, Sp02 generally >/= 90%.
   Currently on 100% FiO2. He is afebrile and has a normal WBC. He
   completed 9/10 days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin day for
   health care associated pneumonia, which was discontiued for lack of
   evidence of pneumonia. Most likely diagnosis remains IPF exacerbation.
   --Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   --Fluid balance net -1L/24hr, with Lasix IV as needed to achieve this
   goal.
   -- Continue Bactrim day 3 for PCP prophylaxis while on steroids.
   --Follow Sp02.
   --ABG and CXR prn changing clinical status.
   2) Bacturia, blood-tinged urine with Foley. Diffential diagnosis for
   this isolated hematuria includes trauma, infection. Malignancy is less
   likely given the acute presentation but elevated LDH would support the
   diagnosis. Nephrolithiasis less likely given lack of pain. Lack of red
   cell casts, proteinuria, dysmorphic red cells make glomerular disease
   less likely.
   Despite bacturia, UTI in this catheterized patient less likely given
   lack of suprapubic pain or elevated temperature. Moreover, he was on
   therapeutic doses of cefedime/vanco, and cipro at the time of the U/A.
   UCx are pending; however, positive cultures in patients with catheters
   cna be misleading; 50% have positive cultures after 5 days and nearly
   all have positive cultures after 30 days. Otherwise, further work-up
   such as imaging and biopsy is not indicated for isolated transient
   glomerular hematuria.
   -Followup on urine culture.
   -Trend BUN and Cr.
   -Monitor UOP for oliguria, with goal of 30cc/hr.
   3) UOP: Adequate auto-diuresis yesterday but required Lasix overnight
   for signs of pulmonary edema. LOS fluid balance is -4L.
   -Goal of  -1L today, as per above. Lasix as needed to ensure goal.
   4) Decreased Hct: Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09 with
   Hct down to 32.0 yesterday with improvement this AM. B12 and folate
   WNL.  Slightly elevated PT/PTT/INR, but no clear evidence of active
   significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.
   -Trend Hct.
   -Transfuse for Hct <25.
   -If Hct drops, consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH:
   retic count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   5) Elevated LDH: Trending up, with LDH of 394 on [**2189-7-16**] and 363 on
   [**2189-7-23**]. Differential diagnosis includes infection, hemolysis,
   hypoperfusion, and accumulative effect of steroids, antibiotics, and/or
   opiates. No leukocytosis yesterday. Hemolysis possible per above.
   Transaminases continue to be  stable and normal, making  liver
   pathology less likely. Last lactate was 0.9 on [**2189-7-22**].
   -Continue to trend LDH.
   -Check CBC, as per above.
   6) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition.
   -Advance diet as tolerated.
   -Consider vitamin K for further increases of INR and/or decreasing
   heparin SC from 5000 units TID to [**Hospital1 **] for further prolongation of PTT
   if coags do not resolve with dietary advancement.
   7) Diet: Tolerated avancement from NPO to dysphagia diet yesterday.
   Speech and swallow will re-evaluate on Monday. We can consult nutrition
   for further input as needed pending this evaluation.
   -Continue dysphagia diet pending speech and swallow evaluation.
   8) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   9) HTN: Increased from 30 to 60 mg PO, but he continued to receive 30
   mg yesterday.
   -Monitor BP today on Imdur 60 mg.
   10) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 90 mg daily, day [**3-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg. Could likely remain on 90 mg for another day.
   -Continue methylprednisolone at 30 mg IV Q8H today; decrease by 10 mg
   tomorrow.
   -Restarted NAC (previously held for NPO status)
   11) Constipation: Multiple guaiac negative stool after 10 days without
   BM.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   12) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   13) FEN:
   -Dysphagia diet, as per above.
   - Glycemic control: ISS fingerstick checks decreased to [**Hospital1 **] given lack
   of need for insulin per scale.
   14) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted for shortness of breath likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia.
- The patient was extubated three days ago and is currently on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status.
- The patient completed 9-10 days of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia but showed no evidence of pneumonia.
- The most likely diagnosis remains IPF exacerbation.
- The patient's current goals include weaning off FiO2 as tolerated, maintaining fluid balance with a net loss of 1L/24hr, continuing Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis while on steroids, monitoring SpO2, and performing ABG and CXR as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2 requirement, indicating possible respiratory distress.
2. Bacteriuria: The patient has blood-tinged urine with Foley, which could be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or catheter-related infection.
3. Decreased Hct: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing, which may be indicative of anemia or ongoing bleeding.
4. Elevated LDH: The patient has elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving
   respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No signs of infection during admission. He was
   extubated 3 days ago and was stable most of yesterday on 60% FiO2, Sp02
   generally >/= 90%. He completed 9/10 days of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day for health care associated pneumonia, which was
   discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia. Resolution of
   tachypneic episode last night with increased O2 and Lasix suggests that
   fluid overload may continue to limit his respiratory status. Home O2
   requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2  94%.
   --Wean FiO2 as tolerated. Attempt switch of O2 delivery from high flow
   face mask to nasal cannula.
   --Fluid balance net -2L/24hr, with Lasix IV as needed to achieve this
   goal.
   -- Continue Bactrim day 3 for PCP prophylaxis while on steroids.
   --Follow Sp02.
   --Reserve ABG and CXR for changing clinical status.
   2) Bacturia, blood-tinged urine with Foley. Diffential diagnosis for
   this isolated hematuria includes trauma and infection.
   Despite bacturia, UTI in this catheterized patient less likely given
   lack of suprapubic pain or elevated temperature. Moreover, he was on

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving
   respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No signs of infection during admission. He was
   extubated 3 days ago and was stable most of yesterday on 60% FiO2, Sp02
   generally >/= 90%. He completed 9/10 days of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin day for health care associated pneumonia, which was
   discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia. Resolution of
   tachypneic episode/crackles on auscultation last night with Lasix
   suggests that fluid overload may continue to limit his respiratory
   status. Coughing has prevented him from sleep and likely precipitates
   tachypneic episodes. Home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with
   SpO2  94%.
   --Wean FiO2 as tolerated. Attempt switching O2 delivery from high flow
   face mask to nasal cannula, with goal of returning to home O2
   requirement of 2L NC.
   -- Lasix 20 mg IVx1, with fluid balance goal of net -2L/24hr.
   --Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen [**12-19**] TAB PO Q8H PRN cough
   -- Continue Bactrim day 3 for PCP prophylaxis while on steroids.
   --Follow Sp02.
   --Reserve ABG and CXR for changing clinical status.
   2) Bacteriuria, hematuria, WBC in urine, in the setting of Foley
   catheterization. Diffential diagnosis includes trauma and infection.
   Despite bacteriuria, UTI in this catheterized patient less likely given
   lack of suprapubic pain or elevated temperature and relatively common
   incidence of bacteriuria in catheterized patients. Moreover, he was on
   therapeutic doses of cefedime/vanco, and cipro at the time of the U/A.
   Thus, we will withhold intervention pending results of UCx. Lack of red
   cell casts, proteinuria, dysmorphic red cells make glomerular pathology
   less likely.
   -Follow up on urine culture.
   -Trend BUN and Cr.
   -Monitor UOP for oliguria, with goal of 30cc/hr.
   3) UOP: Adequate auto-diuresis yesterday but required Lasix overnight
   for signs of pulmonary edema. LOS fluid balance is -4L.
   -Lasix with goal of  -2L today, as per above.
   -Monitor electrolytes for development of hypokalemia and alkalosis from
   Lasix use.
   4) Decreased Hct: Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09 with
   Hct down to 32.0 yesterday, with improvement this AM. B12 and folate
   WNL.  Slightly elevated PT/PTT/INR, but no clear evidence of active
   significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.
   -Trend Hct.
   -Transfuse for Hct <25.
   -If Hct drops, consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH:
   retic count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   5) Diet: Tolerated advancement from NPO to dysphagia diet yesterday.
   Speech and swallow will re-evaluate on Monday. We can consult nutrition
   for further input as needed pending this evaluation.
   -Continue dysphagia diet pending speech and swallow evaluation.
   6) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition.
   -Dysphagia diet, as per above.
   -Consider vitamin K for further increases of INR and/or decreasing
   heparin SC from 5000 units TID to [**Hospital1 **] for further prolongation of PTT
   if coags do not resolve with dietary advancement.
    7) Difficulty sleeping: Likely due to cough. We will reassess pending
   the initiation of anti-tussive regimen, as per above, and will consider
   Haldol 1 mg IV PRN insomnia as needed.
   8) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   9) HTN: Increased from 30 to 60 mg PO, but he continued to receive 30
   mg yesterday.
   -Monitor BP today on Imdur 60 mg.
   10) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 90 mg daily, day [**3-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg. Could likely remain on 90 mg for another day.
   -Continue methylprednisolone at 30 mg IV Q8H today. Will likely need to
   decrease dose tomorrow.
   -Restarted NAC (previously held for NPO status)
   11) Constipation: Multiple guaiac negative stool after 10 days without
   BM.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   -Dysphagia diet, as per above.
   - Glycemic control: D/C
d ISS given lack of need.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   -Remove R IJ today
   -Place peripheral access today
   -Continue with L A-line
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
   16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF, was admitted for shortness of breath likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. He is now post-extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status.
- The patient has been receiving antibiotics for health care-associated pneumonia but the infection was discontinued due to lack of evidence of pneumonia.
- Overnight, the patient experienced an acute tachypneic episode with crackles at the lung bases, which resolved with Lasix 20 mg IV and FiO2 100. He is now stable on FiO2 60 with SpO2 >/= 90%.
- The patient's recent labs show a slightly elevated WBC count, normal hemoglobin, and platelets within normal range. His electrolytes are generally within normal limits, but there is a slight decrease in potassium and bicarbonate.
- The patient's urine analysis shows bacteriuria with >50 RBC, 21-50 WBC, and many bacteria; however, it is negative for leukocytes and nitrites. A urine culture is pending.
- The patient's blood cultures from 07/23 were negative.
- The patient's baseline Hct has been decreasing from 32.5-39.2 since 06/17, with a recent value of 32.0. B12 and folate levels are within normal limits. There is a slightly elevated PT/PTT"

   -Transfuse for Hct <25.
   -If Hct drops, consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH:
   retic count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   5) Diet: Tolerated advancement from NPO to dysphagia diet yesterday.
   Speech and swallow will re-evaluate on Monday. We can consult nutrition
   for further input as needed pending this evaluation.
   -Continue dysphagia diet pending speech and swallow evaluation.
   6) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition.
   -Dysphagia diet, as per above.
   -Consider vitamin K for further increases of INR and/or decreasing
   heparin SC from 5000 units TID to [**Hospital1 **] for further prolongation of PTT
   if coags do not resolve with dietary advancement.
    7) Difficulty sleeping: Likely due to cough. We will reassess pending
   the initiation of anti-tussive regimen, as per above, and will consider
   Haldol 1 mg IV PRN insomnia as needed.
   8) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   9) HTN: Increased from 30 to 60 mg PO, but he continued to receive 30
   mg yesterday.
   -Monitor BP today on Imdur 60 mg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted for shortness of breath likely due to IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. He is post-extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status. The patient has completed 9/10 days of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, which was discontinued due to lack of evidence of pneumonia. He presented with fever, chills, and leukocytosis, but no signs of infection during admission. His respiratory status has improved overnight with Lasix, suggesting ongoing fluid overload limiting his respiratory status. The patient also has a cough, preventing him from sleeping and likely precipitating tachypneic episodes. His home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula with SpO2 of 94%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to IPF exacerbation and fluid overload.
2. Bacteriuria and Hematuria: The patient has bacteriuria, hematuria, and white blood cells in his urine. This could be due to Foley catheterization or infection. Further evaluation is needed, especially considering the patient's recent antibiotic use.
3. Decreased Hematocrit (Hct): The patient's Hct has decreased from 32.5-39.2 since 06/17/2009 to 32.0 yesterday. B12 and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving
   respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No signs of infection during admission. He was
   extubated stable most of yesterday on 60% FiO2, Sp02 generally >/= 90%.
   He completed 10 days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for
   health care associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of
   evidence of pneumonia. Resolution of tachypneic episode/crackles on
   auscultation last night with Lasix suggests that fluid overload may
   continue to limit his respiratory status. Coughing has prevented him
   from sleep and likely precipitates tachypneic episodes. Home O2
   requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2  94%. Nasal canula failed
   yesterday.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Cont to attempt to get patient to nasal canula
   - Hydrocodone PRN for cough (has not gotten due to not taking PO meds)
   - Bactrim prophylaxis
   - Follow SpO2
   - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Diet: Pt had desaturation with PO, nurses worried that patient is
   aspiration risk, not comfortable giving PO medications at this time
   - Await recs from speech and swallow today
   - If able, restart PO medications
   3) Bacteriuria, hematuria, WBC in urine, in the setting of Foley
   catheterization. Diffential diagnosis includes trauma and infection.
    - Urine culture was negative
   4) UOP: Adequate auto-diuresis yesterday but required Lasix overnight
   for signs of pulmonary edema. LOS fluid balance is -4L.
   - Lasix with goal of  even to -1L today, as per above.
   - Monitor BUN/Cr
   - Monitor electrolytes for development of hypokalemia and alkalosis
   from Lasix use.
   5) Decreased Hct: Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09 with
   Hct down to 32.0 yesterday, with improvement this AM. B12 and folate
   WNL.  Slightly elevated PT/PTT/INR, but no clear evidence of active
   significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.  Stable.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   - If Hct drops, consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH:
   retic count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   6) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition.
   -Dysphagia diet, as per above.
   -Consider vitamin K for further increases of INR and/or decreasing
   heparin SC from 5000 units TID to [**Hospital1 **] for further prolongation of PTT
   if coags do not resolve with dietary advancement.
    7) Difficulty sleeping: Likely due to cough. We will reassess pending
   the initiation of anti-tussive regimen, as per above, and will consider
   Haldol 1 mg IV PRN insomnia as needed.
   8) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   9) HTN: Increased from 30 to 60 mg PO, but he continued to receive 30
   mg yesterday.
   - When able to tolerate, restart PO medications
   10) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 90 mg daily, day [**3-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg. Could likely remain on 90 mg for another day.
   - Continue methylprednisolone at 20 mg IV Q8H today.
   - Held NAC due to NPO status
   11) Constipation: Multiple guaiac negative stool after 10 days without
   BM.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - NPO until speech and swallow recs
   - Glycemic control: D/C
d ISS given lack of need.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access: R IJ removed
   - Peripheral IV

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. He has been extubated and is now on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2 requirement, suggesting a possible respiratory failure. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and adjust FiO2 as tolerated.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient may have fluid overload as indicated by the resolution of tachypneic episodes and crackles on auscultation after receiving Lasix. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is necessary.

3. Aspiration Risk: The patient had a desaturation event after taking oral medications, raising concerns about his aspiration risk. It may be necessary to withhold oral medications until further evaluation by a speech and swallow specialist.

4. Bacteriuria and Hematuria: The patient has bacteriuria, hematuria, and white blood cells in his urine, which could be indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, the urine culture was negative, so the cause remains unclear. Monitoring and further evaluation are"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving
   respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No signs of infection during admission. He was
   extubated stable most of yesterday on 60% FiO2, Sp02 generally >/= 90%.
   He completed 10 days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for
   health care associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of
   evidence of pneumonia. Resolution of tachypneic episode/crackles on
   auscultation last night with Lasix suggests that fluid overload may
   continue to limit his respiratory status. Coughing has prevented him
   from sleep and likely precipitates tachypneic episodes. Home O2
   requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2  94%. Nasal canula failed
   yesterday.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Cont to attempt to get patient to nasal canula
   - Hydrocodone PRN for cough (has not gotten due to not taking PO meds)
   - Bactrim prophylaxis
   - Follow SpO2
   - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Diet: Pt had desaturation with PO, nurses worried that patient is
   aspiration risk, not comfortable giving PO medications at this time
   - Await recs from speech and swallow today
   - If able, restart PO medications
   - Thickened
   3) Bacteriuria, hematuria, WBC in urine, in the setting of Foley
   catheterization. Diffential diagnosis includes trauma and infection.
    - Urine culture was negative
   4) UOP: Adequate auto-diuresis yesterday but required Lasix overnight
   for signs of pulmonary edema. LOS fluid balance is -4L.
   - Lasix with goal of  even to -1L today, as per above.
   - Monitor BUN/Cr
   - Monitor electrolytes for development of hypokalemia and alkalosis
   from Lasix use.
   5) Decreased Hct: Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09 with
   Hct down to 32.0 yesterday, with improvement this AM. B12 and folate
   WNL.  Slightly elevated PT/PTT/INR, but no clear evidence of active
   significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.  Stable.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   - If Hct drops, consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH:
   retic count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   6) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition.
   -Dysphagia diet, as per above.
   -Consider vitamin K for further increases of INR and/or decreasing
   heparin SC from 5000 units TID to [**Hospital1 **] for further prolongation of PTT
   if coags do not resolve with dietary advancement.
    7) Difficulty sleeping: Likely due to cough. We will reassess pending
   the initiation of anti-tussive regimen, as per above, and will consider
   Haldol 1 mg IV PRN insomnia as needed.
   8) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   9) HTN: Increased from 30 to 60 mg PO, but he continued to receive 30
   mg yesterday.
   - When able to tolerate, restart PO medications
   10) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 90 mg daily, day [**3-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg. Could likely remain on 90 mg for another day.
   - Continue methylprednisolone at 20 mg IV Q8H today.
   - Held NAC due to NPO status
   11) Constipation: Multiple guaiac negative stool after 10 days without
   BM.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - NPO until speech and swallow recs
   - Glycemic control: D/C
d ISS given lack of need.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access: R IJ removed
   - Peripheral IV
   - A-Line
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
   16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**] .  Need to have meeting
   with pt, Farsi speaker and daughter to discuss goals of care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. He was extubated yesterday and is currently on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status. The patient has completed 10 days of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, which has been discontinued due to lack of evidence of pneumonia. He has been experiencing coughing episodes that have prevented him from sleeping and may precipitate tachypneic episodes. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 96/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula 4L.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to be unstable, as indicated by his previous need for mechanical ventilation and current requirement for high-flow face mask oxygen. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if his condition deteriorates.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative by 1.7 liters, suggesting adequate diuresis. However, he still requires Lasix to manage signs of pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of fluid status is necessary to prevent fluid overload.

3. Bacteriuria and Hematuria: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No  fevers or significant increases in WBC
   since admission. He was extubated 5 days ago. He completed 10 days of
   cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia.
   Decreased O2 requirement from yesterday (6 L NC + non-rebreather) to
   FiO2 80 high flow mask today. Cough clinically improved although
   patient continues to report. Home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula,
   with SpO2  94%; goal would be to return to an O2 requirement as close
   as possible to this baseline. However, his IPF has appeared to have
   worsened. Consider chest CT to establish new baseline for IPF to aid in
   family meeting.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Cont to attempt to get patient to nasal canula
   - Continue Hydrocodone PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   - Follow SpO2
   - ABG for changing clinical status
   -Family meeting today to address goals of care.
   2) Diet: Speech and swallow recommended nectar thick liquids and ground
   solids with 1:1 supervision when stable. He has tolerated meds in
   nectar well.
   -Advanced diet to nectar thick liquids.
   -Restart PO medications.
   3) Hypotensive episode: In the setting of diuresis and negative LOS
   fluid. Improved with IVF. BUN:Cr ratio >20 corroborates pre-renal
   process. No signs of acute bleed, with Hct generally stable and within
   his baseline range.
   -No aggressive diuresis today. Fluid goal 30 cc/hr.
   -Continue to monitor BP.
   -Check Hct at 16:00.
   -Check BUN and Cr tomorrow.
   4) UOP: LOS fluid balance is -6.8L, so no indication for aggressive
   diuresis today as per above. Elevated BUN likely reflects pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   -BUN and Cr tomorrow, as per above.
   4) Decreased Hct: Down from Hct 39 yesterday to 34.0 today. Likely
   reflects lab aberration since Hct was 35.6 when measured 15 minutes
   prior to Hct of 39. Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09.
   B12, folate,  and PT/PTT/INR WNL, and there is no clear evidence of
   active significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.  If Hct continues
   to drop, consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH: retic
   count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   -Hct at 16:00, as per above.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   5) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition. Currently resolved.
    -Diet as per above.
   6) Difficulty sleeping: Likely due to cough. Did not receive Haldo
   yesterday. If anti-tussives + Haldol do not lead to improved sleep
   tonight, consider increasing Haldol to 1 mg Qbedtime.
   -Continue anti-tussive regimen, as per above.
   7) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   8) HTN: Resolved after weaning from sedation/intubation.
   - Restart Imdur 60 mg PO
   9) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 60 mg daily, day [**5-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg.
   - Continue methylprednisolone at 20 mg IV Q8H today. Decrease to 20 mg
   IV BID tomorrow.
   - Restarted NAC.
   10 ) Hematuria. UCx negative.
   -Continue to monitor Hct and UOP.
   10) Constipation: 2 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Thickened liquids per speech and swallow recs.
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access: R IJ removed
   - Peripheral IV

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea suspected to be an IPF exacerbation. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement, along with fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. The etiology is unclear, but it is likely an IPF exacerbation. The patient has been extubated for five days and completed a course of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia. His oxygen requirement has decreased from 6L NC + non-rebreather to FiO2 80 high flow mask. The patient's cough has improved, but he continues to report symptoms. The goal is to wean the patient off high flow oxygen and return him to his baseline requirement of 2L nasal cannula with SpO2 of 94%. A chest CT is planned to establish a new baseline for IPF.

2. Diet: The patient is recommended to have nectar-thick liquids and ground solids with 1:1 supervision when stable. The diet has been advanced to nectar-thick liquids, and PO medications have been restarted.

3. Hypotensive Episode: The patient experienced hypotension during diuresis and negative fluid balance. This improved with intravenous fluids. The BUN/Cr ratio is greater than 20, indicating a pre-renal process. There are"

   ETC)
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with improving
   respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No signs of infection during admission. He was
   extubated 5 days ago. He completed 10 days of cefepime, vancomycin and
   ciprofloxacin for health care associated pneumonia, which was
   discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia. Currently on 6 L
   non-rebreather. Home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2
   94%.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Cont to attempt to get patient to nasal canula
   - Hydrocodone PRN for cough (has not gotten due to not taking PO meds)
   - Bactrim prophylaxis
   - Follow SpO2
   - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Diet: Pt had desaturation with PO, nurses worried that patient is
   aspiration risk, not comfortable giving PO medications at this time
   - Await recs from speech and swallow today
   - If able, restart PO medications
   - Thickened
   4) UOP: Adequate auto-diuresis yesterday but required Lasix overnight
   for signs of pulmonary edema. Stable Cr. Low BPs yesterday improved
   with IVF and LOS fluid balance is -6.8L, so no indication for
   aggressive diuresis today.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr.
   5) Decreased Hct: Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09 with
   Hct down to 32.0 yesterday, with improvement this AM. B12 and folate
   WNL.  PT/PTT/INR WNL, no clear evidence of active significant bleed.
   Stool is guaiac negative.  Stable. If Hct drops, consider evaluation
   for hemolysis given elevated LDH: retic count, haptoglobin, peripheral
   smear.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   6) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition. Currently resolved.
   -Continue diet as tolerated.
    7) Difficulty sleeping: Likely due to cough.
   -Continue anti-tussive regimen, as per above, and will consider Haldol
   1 mg IV PRN insomnia as needed.
   8) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety. Has received Haldol, with
   improvement of agitation.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   9) HTN: Increased from 30 to 60 mg PO.
   - When able to tolerate, restart PO medications
   10) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 90 mg daily, day [**5-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg.
   - Continue methylprednisolone at 20 mg IV Q8H today.
   - Held NAC due to NPO status.
   Hematuria. UCx negative.
   -Continue to monitor Hct
   11) Constipation: Multiple guaiac negative stool after 10 days without
   BM.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - NPO until speech and swallow recs
   - Glycemic control: D/C
d ISS given lack of need.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access: R IJ removed

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea suspected to be an IPF exacerbation. He has been experiencing increased oxygen requirement, fever, chills, and leukocytosis. The patient was previously extubated but is now on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement, indicating possible respiratory failure. The patient's current respiratory status is stable, but close monitoring is required.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which could be due to immobility or pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessment and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent further complications.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as ischemic heart disease. Monitoring of cardiac status and adherence to prescribed medications are crucial.

4. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which may be attributed to fluid overload or cardiac issues. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions like diuresis or fluid restriction are necessary.

5. Intestinal Lung Disease (ILD): The patient has a diagnosis of ILD, including IPF. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and adherence to prescribed treatments are essential to prevent further exacerbation.

6. Hematuria: The patient presented"

   stable.
   -Advanced diet to nectar thick liquids
   -Restart PO medications
   3) UOP: Adequate auto-diuresis yesterday but required Lasix overnight
   for signs of pulmonary edema. Stable Cr. Low BPs yesterday improved
   with IVF and LOS fluid balance is -6.8L, so no indication for
   aggressive diuresis today.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr.
   4) Decreased Hct: Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09,
   currently stable. B12 and folate WNL.  PT/PTT/INR WNL, no clear
   evidence of active significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.
   Stable. If desats or signs of acute blood loss, check Hct and  consider
   evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH: retic count, haptoglobin,
   peripheral smear.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   5) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition. Currently resolved.
    -Diet as per above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea suspected to be an IPF exacerbation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been extubated for 5 days. He is on high-flow face mask with improving respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement, along with fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. It is unclear whether this is due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive and tachycardic after being diuresed, indicating a potential risk for shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of baseline anemia with Hct levels ranging from 32.5-39.2 since 2009. The current Hct level is stable, but there is a possibility of developing AKI due to dehydration or medication-related nephrotoxicity. Regular monitoring of renal function is essential.
4. Prolonged Prothrombin Time/Partial Thromboplastin Time (PT/PTT): The patient has prolonged PT/PTT, which may be attributed to heparin therapy or insufficient nutrition"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No  fevers or significant increases in WBC
   since admission. He was extubated 5 days ago. He completed 10 days of
   cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia.
   Decreased O2 requirement from yesterday (6 L NC + non-rebreather) to
   FiO2 80 high flow mask today. Cough clinically improved although
   patient continues to report. Home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula,
   with SpO2  94%; goal would be to return to an O2 requirement as close
   as possible to this baseline. However, his IPF has appeared to have
   worsened. Consider chest CT to establish new baseline for IPF to aid in
   family meeting.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Cont to attempt to get patient to nasal canula
   - Continue Hydrocodone PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   - Follow SpO2
   - ABG for changing clinical status
   -Family meeting today to address goals of care.
   2) Diet: Speech and swallow recommended nectar thick liquids and ground
   solids with 1:1 supervision when stable. He has tolerated meds in
   nectar well.
   -Advanced diet to nectar thick liquids.
   -Restart PO medications.
   3) Hypotensive episode: In the setting of diuresis and negative LOS
   fluid. Improved with IVF. BUN:Cr ratio >20 corroborates pre-renal
   process. No signs of acute bleed, with Hct generally stable and within
   his baseline range.
   -No aggressive diuresis today. Fluid goal 30 cc/hr.
   -Continue to monitor BP.
   -Check Hct at 16:00.
   -Check BUN and Cr tomorrow.
   4) UOP: LOS fluid balance is -6.8L, so no indication for aggressive
   diuresis today as per above. Elevated BUN likely reflects pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   -BUN and Cr tomorrow, as per above.
   4) Decreased Hct: Down from Hct 39 yesterday to 34.0 today. Likely
   reflects lab aberration since Hct was 35.6 when measured 15 minutes
   prior to Hct of 39. Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09.
   B12, folate,  and PT/PTT/INR WNL, and there is no clear evidence of
   active significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.  If Hct continues
   to drop, consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH: retic
   count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   -Hct at 16:00, as per above.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   5) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition. Currently resolved.
    -Diet as per above.
   6) Difficulty sleeping: Likely due to cough. Did not receive Haldo
   yesterday. If anti-tussives + Haldol do not lead to improved sleep
   tonight, consider increasing Haldol to 1 mg Qbedtime.
   -Continue anti-tussive regimen, as per above.
   7) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   8) HTN: Resolved after weaning from sedation/intubation.
   - Restart Imdur 60 mg PO
   9) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 60 mg daily, day [**5-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg.
   - Continue methylprednisolone at 20 mg IV Q8H today. Decrease to 20 mg
   IV BID tomorrow.
   - Restarted NAC.
   10 ) Hematuria. UCx negative.
   -Continue to monitor Hct and UOP.
   10) Constipation: 2 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Thickened liquids per speech and swallow recs.
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access: R IJ removed

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No  fevers or significant increases in WBC
   since admission. He was extubated 5 days ago. He completed 10 days of
   cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia.
   Decreased O2 requirement from yesterday (6 L NC + non-rebreather) to
   FiO2 80 high flow mask today. Cough clinically improved although
   patient continues to report. Home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula,
   with SpO2  94%; goal would be to return to an O2 requirement as close
   as possible to this baseline. However, his IPF has appeared to have
   worsened. Consider chest CT to establish new baseline for IPF to aid in
   family meeting.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Cont to attempt to get patient to nasal canula
   - Continue Hydrocodone PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   - Follow SpO2
   - ABG for changing clinical status
   -Family meeting today to address goals of care.
   2) Diet: Speech and swallow recommended nectar thick liquids and ground
   solids with 1:1 supervision when stable. He has tolerated meds in
   nectar well.
   -Advanced diet to nectar thick liquids
   -Restart PO medications
   3) Hypotensive episode: In the setting of diuresis and negative LOS
   fluid. Improved with IVF. BUN:Cr ratio >20 corroborates pre-renal
   process. No signs of acute bleed, with Hct generally stable and within
   his baseline range.
   -No aggressive diuresis today. Fluid goal 30 cc/hr.
   -Continue to monitor BP.
   -Check Hct at 16:00.
   -Check BUN and Cr tomorrow.
   4) UOP: LOS fluid balance is -6.8L, so no indication for aggressive
   diuresis today as per above. Elevated BUN likely reflects pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   -BUN and Cr tomorrow, as per above.
   4) Decreased Hct: Down from Hct 39 yesterday to 34.0 today. Likely
   reflects lab aberration since Hct was 35.6 when measured 15 minutes
   prior to Hct of 39. Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09.
   B12, folate,  and PT/PTT/INR WNL, and there is no clear evidence of
   active significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.  If Hct continues
   to drop, consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH: retic
   count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   -Hct at 16:00, as per above.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   5) Prolonged PT/PTT. Differential diagnosis heparin therapy and/or
   insufficient nutrition. Currently resolved.
    -Diet as per above.
   6) Difficulty sleeping: Likely due to cough. Did not receive Haldo
   yesterday. If anti-tussives + Haldol do not lead to improved sleep
   tonight, consider increasing Haldol to 1 mg Qbedtime.
   -Continue anti-tussive regimen, as per above.
   7) Agitation. History of agitation/anxiety.
   -Continue Haloperidol 0.25 mg IV TID PRN agitation.
   8) HTN: Resolved after weaning from sedation/intubation.
   - Restart Imdur 60 mg PO
   9) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 60 mg daily, day [**5-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg.
   - Continue methylprednisolone at 20 mg IV Q8H today. Decrease to 20 mg
   IV BID tomorrow.
   - Restarted NAC.
   10 ) Hematuria. UCx negative.
   -Continue to monitor Hct and UOP.
   10) Constipation: 2 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since.
   -Continue bowel regimen.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Thickened fluids per speech and swallow recs.
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access: R IJ removed
   - Peripheral IV
   - A-Line
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No fevers since admission, WBC increased over
   past 2 days. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9 days of
   cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia. O2
   requirement weaned to 80% high flow yesterday but increased to 95%
   overnight. Cough improved. Etiology of increased WBC unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1246**] O2
   requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2  94%; goal would be to
   return to an O2 requirement as close as possible to this baseline.
   However, there is concern for interval progression of IPF that will
   impair his ability to achieve his baseline.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Cont to attempt to get patient to nasal canula
   - Continue Hydrocodone PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   -Trend WBC
   - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Decreased Hct: Generally stable but continues to trend down.
   Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09. B12, folate WNL, and
   there is no clear evidence of active significant bleed. Stool is guaiac
   negative.  If Hct continues to drop, consider evaluation for hemolysis
   given elevated LDH: retic count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   -Hct Q24H
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   3) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   4) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -7L, so
   no indication for aggressive diuresis today as per above. Elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: With subsequent desaturation. History of
   agitation/anxiety. Haldol 0.25mg without effect.
   -Increase to 0.5-1 mg PRN anxiety.
   -Consider Zyprexa PRN anxiety if Haldol is ineffective.
   6) Difficulty sleeping: Improved last Likely due to cough. Improvement
   with 10 mg hydrocodone at night.
   -Continue anti-tussive regimen, as per above.
   7) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. The patient has been extubated for 6 days and is currently on high-flow face mask with declining respiratory status. He completed a course of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, which was discontinued due to lack of evidence of pneumonia. The patient's oxygen requirement increased overnight, indicating ongoing respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels. The WBC count has been increasing over the past two days. The patient is tolerating advancement of diet to thickened liquids and has restarted oral medications. His urine output has been adequate, with a goal of maintaining >30 cc/hr. The patient has a history of difficulty sleeping, which improved with the use of hydrocodone at night. There is no evidence of active significant bleed, but further evaluation for hemolysis should be considered if Hct continues to drop. 

The patient's anxiety and agitation have been managed with Haldol, but there has been no effect. Zyprexa may be considered as an alternative if Haldol is ineffective.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No fevers since admission, WBC increased over
   past 2 days. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9 days of
   cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia. O2
   requirement weaned to 80% high flow yesterday but increased to 95%
   overnight. Cough improved. Etiology of increased WBC unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1246**] O2
   requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2  94%; goal would be to
   return to an O2 requirement as close as possible to this baseline.
   However, there is concern for interval progression of IPF that will
   impair his ability to achieve his baseline.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Cont to attempt to get patient to nasal canula
   - Continue Hydrocodone PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   -Trend WBC
   - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Decreased Hct: Generally stable but continues to trend down.
   Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-17**]//09. B12, folate WNL, and
   there is no clear evidence of active significant bleed. Stool is guaiac
   negative.  If Hct continues to drop, consider evaluation for hemolysis
   given elevated LDH: retic count, haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   -Hct Q24H
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   3) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   4) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -7L, so
   no indication for aggressive diuresis today as per above. Elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: With subsequent desaturation. History of
   agitation/anxiety. Haldol 0.25mg without effect.
   -Increase to 0.5-1 mg PRN anxiety.
   -Consider Zyprexa PRN anxiety if Haldol is ineffective.
   6) Difficulty sleeping: Improved last Likely due to cough. Improvement
   with 10 mg hydrocodone at night.
   -Continue anti-tussive regimen, as per above.
   7) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 60 mg daily, day [**5-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg.
   -Decrease to 20 mg IV BID tomorrow.
   - Continue NAC.
   8 ) Hematuria. UCx negative.
   -Continue to monitor Hct and UOP.
   9) Constipation: 3 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since.
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   10) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access: R IJ removed
   - Peripheral IV
   - A-Line

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of
   pneumonia. No fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 2 days.
   O2 requirement weaned to 80% high flow yesterday but increased to 95%
   overnight. Cough improved. Etiology of increased WBC unclear. There is
   no change to his physical exam since yesterday, but there have been no
   CXR for 2 days. Home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2
   94%; goal would be to return to an O2 requirement as close as possible
   to this baseline. However, there is concern for interval progression of
   IPF that will impair his ability to achieve his baseline.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   -CXR for leukocytosis.
   -Trend WBC
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Elevated WBC. No clear etiology. Afrebile. No change to respiratory
   exam. Hematuria, bacteriruia, and WBC in urine with Foley in place with
   U/A and negative UCx from [**2189-7-25**].
   -CXR, as per above.
   -Repeat U/A.
   -D/C Foley.
   -Trend WBC.
   3) Decreased Hct: Generally stable but continues to trend down.
   Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-25**]. B12, folate WNL. Hematoma
   of L upper arm; otherwise there is no clear evidence of active
   significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.  If Hct continues to drop,
   consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH: retic count,
   haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   -Hct Q24H
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   4) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   -Follow up speech and swallow recommendations today.
   5) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -7L, so
   no indication for diuresis today as per above. Persisent elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   6) Anxiety/agitation: With subsequent desaturation. History of
   agitation/anxiety. Haldol 0.25mg without effect. Consider increasing
   Haldol to standing dose or Zyprexa if delirium develops. Consider
   adding SSRI in non-acute setting.
   -Lorazepam 0.25 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium.
   6) Difficulty sleeping: Improved last Likely due to cough. Improvement
   with 10 mg hydrocodone at night.
   -Continue anti-tussive regimen, as per above.
   7) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for shortness of breath likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. He was extubated 6 days ago and is currently on high-flow oxygen via face mask. His respiratory status has been declining, with increased oxygen requirement overnight. He has completed a course of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, which was discontinued due to lack of evidence of pneumonia. No fevers have been present since admission, but his white blood cell count has increased over the past two days. He has tolerated advancement of diet to thickened liquids and has restarted oral medications. His urine output has been adequate. The patient has been anxious and agitated, particularly during desaturation episodes. He has difficulty sleeping but has shown improvement with guaifenesin-codeine. There is a concern for interval progression of IPF that may impair his ability to achieve his baseline oxygen requirement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has been declining, and he requires a high level of oxygen support. If his condition worsens, he may develop respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Although the patient has completed a course of antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, there is still a possibility of ongoing infection, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms.
3. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, which could indicate a urinary tract infection or another underlying condition"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of
   pneumonia. No fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 2 days.
   O2 requirement weaned to 80% high flow yesterday but increased to 95%
   overnight. Cough improved. Etiology of increased WBC unclear. There is
   no change to his physical exam since yesterday, but there have been no
   CXR for 2 days. Home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2
   94%; goal would be to return to an O2 requirement as close as possible
   to this baseline. However, there is concern for interval progression of
   IPF that will impair his ability to achieve his baseline.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   -CXR for leukocytosis.
   -Trend WBC
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Elevated WBC. No clear etiology. Afrebile. No change to respiratory
   exam. Hematuria, bacteriruia, and WBC in urine with Foley in place with
   U/A and negative UCx from [**2189-7-25**].
   -CXR, as per above.
   -Repeat U/A.
   -D/C Foley.
   -Trend WBC.
   3) Decreased Hct: Generally stable but continues to trend down.
   Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-25**]. B12, folate WNL. Hematoma
   of L upper arm; otherwise there is no clear evidence of active
   significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.  If Hct continues to drop,
   consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH: retic count,
   haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   -Hct Q24H
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   4) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   -Follow up speech and swallow recommendations today.
   5) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -7L, so
   no indication for diuresis today as per above. Persisent elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   6) Anxiety/agitation: With subsequent desaturation. History of
   agitation/anxiety. Haldol 0.25mg without effect. Consider increasing
   Haldol to standing dose or Zyprexa if delirium develops.
   -Lorazepam 0.25 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium.
   6) Difficulty sleeping: Improved last Likely due to cough. Improvement
   with 10 mg hydrocodone at night.
   -Continue anti-tussive regimen, as per above.
   7) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 60 mg daily, day [**5-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg.
   -Decrease to 20 mg IV BID tomorrow.
   - Continue NAC.
   8 ) Hematuria. UCx negative ion [**2189-7-25**].
   -Continue to monitor Hct and UOP.
   -U/A and UCx per above.
   9) Constipation: 4 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since. He had not been taking PO bowel regimen
   meds because of NPO status, but diet has since been advanced.
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP. Ensure that hold
   parameters for rehab are specified.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   - A-Line
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
   16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Wean from high flow O2 if possible. D/C to MACU at
   [**Hospital **] rehab (can manage high flow O2) tomorrow, pending above.
   Communicate plan to family.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of
   pneumonia. No fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 2 days.
   O2 requirement weaned to 80% high flow yesterday but increased to 95%
   overnight. Cough improved. Etiology of increased WBC unclear. There is
   no change to his physical exam since yesterday, but there have been no
   CXR for 2 days. Home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2
   94%; goal would be to return to an O2 requirement as close as possible
   to this baseline. However, there is concern for interval progression of
   IPF that will impair his ability to achieve his baseline.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   -CXR for leukocytosis.
   -Trend WBC
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Elevated WBC. No clear etiology. Afrebile. No change to respiratory
   exam. Hematuria, bacteriruia, and WBC in urine with Foley in place with
   U/A and negative UCx from [**2189-7-25**].
   -CXR, as per above.
   -Repeat U/A.
   -D/C Foley.
   -Trend WBC.
   3) Decreased Hct: Generally stable but continues to trend down.
   Baseline anemia of Hct 32.5-39.2 since [**6-25**]. B12, folate WNL. Hematoma
   of L upper arm; otherwise there is no clear evidence of active
   significant bleed. Stool is guaiac negative.  If Hct continues to drop,
   consider evaluation for hemolysis given elevated LDH: retic count,
   haptoglobin, peripheral smear.
   -Hct Q24H
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   4) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   -Follow up speech and swallow recommendations today.
   5) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -7L, so
   no indication for diuresis today as per above. Persisent elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
    - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   6) Anxiety/agitation: With subsequent desaturation. History of
   agitation/anxiety. Haldol 0.25mg without effect. Consider increasing
   Haldol to standing dose or Zyprexa if delirium develops. Consider
   adding SSRI in non-acute setting.
   -Lorazepam 0.25 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium.
   6) Difficulty sleeping: Improved last Likely due to cough. Improvement
   with 10 mg hydrocodone at night.
   -Continue anti-tussive regimen, as per above.
   7) IPF: Tapering steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 549**]
s recommendations over 10
   days to 40 mg. Currently on total 60 mg daily, day [**5-27**] of steroid
   taper to 40 mg.
   -Decrease to 20 mg IV BID tomorrow.
   - Continue NAC.
   8 ) Hematuria. UCx negative ion [**2189-7-25**].
   -Continue to monitor Hct and UOP.
   -U/A and UCx per above.
   9) Constipation: 4 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since. He had not been taking PO bowel regimen
   meds because of NPO status, but diet has since been advanced.
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP. Ensure that hold
   parameters for rehab are specified.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   - A-Line
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
   16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Wean from high flow O2 if possible. D/C to MACU at
   [**Hospital **] rehab (can manage high flow O2) tomorrow, pending above.
   Communicate plan to family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for shortness of breath, likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. He was extubated 6 days ago and has been on a high-flow face mask with declining respiratory status. His current oxygen requirement is 95% FiO2, and he is tolerating advancement of his diet to thickened liquids. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is unclear in etiology, and no clear evidence of active bleeding. He also has a history of anxiety, agitation, difficulty sleeping, and hematuria with a negative urinalysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is declining despite being on a high-flow face mask. There is a concern for interval progression of IPF that may impair his ability to wean off oxygen.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count could indicate an ongoing infection, which needs to be evaluated further.
3. Hemolysis: The patient's decreasing hematocrit and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels suggest the possibility of hemolysis.
4. Renal Issues: The patient has persistent hematuria with bacteriuria, indicating a potential renal issue. The Foley catheter should be discontinued, and a repeat urinalysis should be done.
5. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. No fevers since admission, WBC increased over
   past 2 days. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9 days of
   cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia. O2
   requirement weaned to 80% high flow yesterday but increased to 95%
   overnight. Cough improved. Etiology of increased WBC unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1246**] O2
   requirement is 2L nasal cannula, with SpO2  94%; goal would be to
   return to an O2 requirement as close as possible to this baseline.
   However, there is concern for interval progression of IPF that will
   impair his ability to achieve his baseline.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation or pneumonia. He was extubated 6 days ago and completed a course of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, which was discontinued due to lack of evidence of pneumonia.
- The patient's oxygen requirement was weaned to 80% high flow mask yesterday but increased to 95% overnight. His cough has improved, but the etiology of his increased WBC (white blood cell count) is unclear.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 106/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on high-flow nasal cannula.
- The patient has a decreased hemoglobin (Hct) level, which has been generally stable but continues to trend down. There is no clear evidence of active significant bleed, but further evaluation for hemolysis may be necessary if the Hct continues to drop.
- The patient has tolerated advancement to nectar-thick liquids and ground solids with 1:1 supervision.
- The patient's urine output (UOP) is adequate, with a goal of maintaining >30"

   improved from [**2189-7-25**]).
   Imaging: CXR from [**2189-7-29**]: Severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality in
   the lung bases has been relatively stable. Suprahilar consolidation has
   varied in radiodensity, probably due to a component of atelectasis.

   Microbiology: UCx pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of
   pneumonia. No fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 2 days.
   Etiology of increased WBC unclear. There is no change to his physical
   exam or CXR  since yesterday. Home O2 requirement is 2L nasal cannula,
   with SpO2  94%; goal would be to return to an O2 requirement as close
   as possible to this baseline. However, there is concern for interval
   progression of IPF that will impair his ability to achieve his
   baseline.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
    - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Elevated WBC. No clear etiology. Afrebile. No change to respiratory
   exam. CXR without change. U/A cleaner than U/A on [**2189-7-25**], neg for leuk
   and nitrite. Foley and A-line discontinued.
   3) Decreased Hct: Stable.
   -Hct Q24H
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   4) Anxiety/agitation: Started Lorazepam yesterday. Consider SSRI in
   outpatient setting.
   -Continue Lorazepam 0.25 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium.
   5) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   6) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -8L, so
   no indication for diuresis today as per above. Persisent elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   7) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue 20 mg IV BID tomorrow. Change to PO at discharge.
    - Continue NAC.
   9) Constipation: 5 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since. He had not been taking PO bowel regimen
   meds because of NPO status, but diet has since been advanced.
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP. Ensure that hold
   parameters for rehab are specified.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Imdur, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Wean from high flow O2 if possible. D/C to MACU at
   [**Hospital **] rehab (can manage high flow O2) today, pending above.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), admitted for shortness of breath likely due to IPF exacerbation or possible pneumonia. The patient was extubated 6 days ago and is currently on high-flow face mask with slowing declining respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is declining despite being on high-flow face mask. There is concern for interval progression of IPF, which may impair his ability to maintain baseline oxygen requirement.

2. Elevated White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The patient's WBC count has been increasing over the past two days. The etiology of the elevated WBC count is unclear. It could be due to an ongoing infection or another underlying condition.

3. Decreased Hematocrit (Hct): The patient's Hct levels are decreasing. This could be a result of fluid administration, blood loss, or other causes. Monitoring and appropriate management are required.

4. Anxiety/Agitation: The patient has been started on lorazepam for anxiety. Continuous monitoring for delirium and potential worsening of anxiety symptoms is necessary.

5. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement since advancing his diet. Ensuring adequate bowel regimen management is crucial to prevent constipation.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of
   pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he has had
   increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No fevers since
   admission, WBC increased over past 3 days though currently stable. CXR
   without changes to underlying parenchymal disease but given significant
   fibrosis, potential infiltrates would be difficult to assess. Etiology
   of increased WBC unclear, but he is at risk for [**Name (NI) 6601**], and fever and
   leukocytosis may be suppressed in the setting of steroids. Thus,
   empiric treatment for possible [**Name (NI) 6601**] is indicated. However, the likely
   etiology of his worsening condition is likely progression of his
   underlying IPF.
   -Start empiric Zosyn and Ciprofloxacin for possible [**Name (NI) 6601**]
   -Trend WBC.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
    - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Elevated WBC. As per above, no clear etiology but [**Name (NI) 6601**] is possible
   despite lack of fever and no change to CXR. U/A cleaner than U/A on
   [**2189-7-25**], neg for leuk and nitrite. Foley and A-line discontinued.
   -Trend WBC per above.
   -Follow up UCx.
   3) Decreased Hct: Stable.
   -Hct Q24H
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   4) Constipation: 5 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since. He had not been taking PO bowel regimen
   meds because of NPO status, but diet has since been advanced. He has
   not received
    -Continue bowel regimen, with suppository and/or enema today.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Started Lorazepam yesterday. Consider SSRI in
   outpatient setting.
   -Increase Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely. Hct is
   stable, making hemolysis less likely. Consider hemolysis work up if Hct
   drops.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -8L, so
   no indication for diuresis today as per above. Persisent elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue 20 mg IV BID tomorrow. Change to PO at discharge.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP. Hold parameters
   added.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Wean from high flow O2 if possible. D/C to MACU at

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, thought to be consistent with an IPF exacerbation. The patient was extubated six days ago and has been on high-flow face mask oxygen therapy. However, the patient's respiratory status has been declining, with desaturation in the 80s during activity but recovering with slow deep breathing exercises.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals expiratory wheeze and crackles bilaterally, as well as a hematoma and ecchymosis on the left upper arm.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.3 K/uL, elevated platelet count of 186,000/mm3, and decreased hemoglobin concentration of 33.7%. The patient's kidney function tests indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and a stable creatinine level. The patient's liver function tests show mildly elevated liver enzymes, while the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is significantly elevated at 539 IU/L.

Imaging studies reveal severe interstitial pulmonary abnormalities"

   Fluid analysis / Other labs: U/A with yellow specimen, large amounts of

   nitrites. On microscopic exam, 21-50 RBC, [**5-27**] WBC, few bacteria (all
   improved from [**2189-7-25**]).
   Imaging: CXR from [**2189-7-29**]: Severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality in
   the lung bases has been relatively stable. Suprahilar consolidation has
   varied in radiodensity, probably due to a component of atelectasis.
   There is no convincing evidence for pneumonia but that might easily go
   undetected. Heart size is normal.
   Pleural effusion if any is minimal.
   Microbiology: UCx pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of
   pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he has had
   increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No fevers since
   admission, WBC increased over past 3 days though currently stable. CXR
   without changes to underlying parenchymal disease but given significant
   fibrosis, potential infiltrates would be difficult to assess. Etiology
   of increased WBC unclear, but he is at risk for [**Name (NI) 6601**], and fever and
   leukocytosis may be suppressed in the setting of steroids. Thus,
   empiric treatment for possible [**Name (NI) 6601**] is indicated. However, the likely
   etiology of his worsening condition is likely progression of his
   underlying IPF.
   -Start empiric Zosyn and Ciprofloxacin for possible [**Name (NI) 6601**]
   -Trend WBC.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
    - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Elevated WBC. As per above, no clear etiology but [**Name (NI) 6601**] is possible
   despite lack of fever and no change to CXR. U/A cleaner than U/A on
   [**2189-7-25**], neg for leuk and nitrite. Foley and A-line discontinued.
   -Trend WBC per above.
   3) Decreased Hct: Stable.
   -Hct Q24H
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   4) Constipation: 5 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since. He had not been taking PO bowel regimen
   meds because of NPO status, but diet has since been advanced. He has
   not received
    -Continue bowel regimen, with suppository and/or enema today.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Started Lorazepam yesterday. Consider SSRI in
   outpatient setting.
   -Increase Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely. Hct is
   stable, making hemolysis less likely. Consider hemolysis work up if Hct
   drops.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -8L, so
   no indication for diuresis today as per above. Persisent elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue 20 mg IV BID tomorrow. Change to PO at discharge.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP. Hold parameters
   added.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Wean from high flow O2 if possible. D/C to MACU at
   [**Hospital **] rehab (can manage high flow O2) today, pending above.

   Pleural effusion if any is minimal.
   Microbiology: UCx pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of
   pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he has had
   increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No fevers since
   admission, WBC increased over past 3 days though currently stable. CXR
   without changes to underlying parenchymal disease but given significant
   fibrosis, potential infiltrates would be difficult to assess. Etiology
   of increased WBC unclear, but he is at risk for [**Name (NI) 6601**], and fever and
   leukocytosis may be suppressed in the setting of steroids. Thus,
   empiric treatment for possible [**Name (NI) 6601**] is indicated. However, the likely
   etiology of his worsening condition is likely progression of his
   underlying IPF.
   -Start empiric Zosyn and Ciprofloxacin for possible [**Name (NI) 6601**]
   -Trend WBC.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
    - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Elevated WBC. As per above, no clear etiology but [**Name (NI) 6601**] is possible
   despite lack of fever and no change to CXR. U/A cleaner than U/A on
   [**2189-7-25**], neg for leuk and nitrite. Foley and A-line discontinued.
   -Trend WBC per above.
   -Follow up UCx.
   3) Decreased Hct: Stable.
   -Hct Q24H
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   4) Constipation: 5 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since. He had not been taking PO bowel regimen
   meds because of NPO status, but diet has since been advanced. He has
   not received meds PR.
    -Continue bowel regimen, with suppository and/or enema today.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Started Lorazepam yesterday. Consider SSRI in
   outpatient setting.
   -Increase Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely. Hct is
   stable, making hemolysis less likely. Consider hemolysis work up if Hct
   drops.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -8L, so
   no indication for diuresis today as per above. Persisent elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue 20 mg IV BID tomorrow.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP. Hold parameters
   added.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Wean from high flow O2 if possible. D/C to MACU at
   [**Hospital **] rehab (can manage high flow O2) today, pending above.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea thought to be consistent with IPF exacerbation. The patient has been experiencing increased sputum production, no bowel movements for 5 days, and an elevated white blood cell count. He also has a fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection or suppression of symptoms due to steroids. The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), so empiric treatment for possible HAP and VAP is indicated.

The patient's respiratory status has been declining despite optimization with diuretics, antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and he continues to desaturate during activity but recovers with slow deep breathing exercises. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 10.4 K/uL, platelet count of 186 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 103 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L. The patient's electrolyte balance is negative, indicating a fluid loss of 910 mL.

The patient's imaging shows severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality in the lung bases, which has been relatively stable. There is no convincing evidence for pneumonia, but minimal pleural effusion is present.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has failed to improve despite treatment, and he is at risk for further complications. Empiric treatment for possible HAP and VAP is indicated. The likely etiology of his worsening condition is likely progression of his underlying IPF.

2. Elevated WBC: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but no clear etiology has been identified. The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and a urinary analysis shows improvement from the previous day.

3. Decreased Hct: The patient's hematocrit level is decreased, but it is stable. Monitoring and trending are recommended.

4. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement for 5 days and has been receiving a bowel regimen. The patient's diet has been advanced, and he will receive medications per rectum.

5. Anxiety/Agitation: The patient is experiencing anxiety and agitation. Lorazepam has been started, and an SSRI may be considered in the outpatient setting.

6. Elevated LDH: The patient's lact"

The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea thought to be consistent with IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago and is currently on high-flow face mask with slowing declining respiratory status. The patient has been experiencing increased sputum production, no bowel movement for 5 days, and anxiety that has not improved with lorazepam. His arterial line was stopped on [**2189-7-29**] at 06:07 PM. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 122/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination revealed expiratory wheeze and crackles bilaterally. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated platelet count. Imaging shows severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality in the lung bases with no convincing evidence for pneumonia. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, lorazepam, and steroids for IPF.

   nitrites. On microscopic exam, 21-50 RBC, [**5-27**] WBC, few bacteria (all
   improved from [**2189-7-25**]).
   Imaging: CXR from [**2189-7-29**]: Severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality in
   the lung bases has been relatively stable. Suprahilar consolidation has
   varied in radiodensity, probably due to a component of atelectasis.
   There is no convincing evidence for pneumonia but that might easily go
   undetected. Heart size is normal.
   Pleural effusion if any is minimal.
   Microbiology: UCx pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of
   pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he has had
   increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No fevers since
   admission, WBC increased over past 3 days though currently stable. CXR
   without changes to underlying parenchymal disease but given significant
   fibrosis, potential infiltrates would be difficult to assess. Etiology
   of increased WBC unclear, but he is at risk for [**Name (NI) 6601**], and fever and
   leukocytosis may be suppressed in the setting of steroids. Thus,
   empiric treatment for possible [**Name (NI) 6601**] is indicated. However, the likely
   etiology of his worsening condition is likely progression of his
   underlying IPF.
   -Start empiric Zosyn and Ciprofloxacin for possible [**Name (NI) 6601**]
   -Trend WBC.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
    - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Elevated WBC. As per above, no clear etiology but [**Name (NI) 6601**] is possible
   despite lack of fever and no change to CXR. U/A cleaner than U/A on
   [**2189-7-25**], neg for leuk and nitrite. Foley and A-line discontinued.
   -Trend WBC per above.
   3) Decreased Hct: Stable.
   -Hct Q24H
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   4) Constipation: 5 days ago, he had guaiac negative stool x 4 after 10
   days without BM. No BM since. He had not been taking PO bowel regimen
   meds because of NPO status, but diet has since been advanced. He has
   not received
    -Continue bowel regimen, with suppository and/or enema today.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Started Lorazepam yesterday. Consider SSRI in
   outpatient setting.
   -Increase Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely. Hct is
   stable, making hemolysis less likely. Consider hemolysis work up if Hct
   drops.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Adequate yesterday and >30 cc/hr. LOS fluid balance is -8L, so
   no indication for diuresis today as per above. Persisent elevated BUN
   likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr stable and WNL.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr, as per above.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue 20 mg IV BID tomorrow. Change to PO at discharge.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP. Hold parameters
   added.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: Not required at this time.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Wean from high flow O2 if possible. D/C to MACU at
   [**Hospital **] rehab (can manage high flow O2) today, pending above.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea thought to be consistent with IPF exacerbation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on high-flow face mask with slowing declining respiratory status.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.4°C (97.6°F).

The patient's physical examination reveals expiratory wheeze and crackles bilaterally, on nebs at the time of examination. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and bowel sounds are present. The patient has warm and well-perfused extremities with 1+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally. There is also a hematoma and ecchymosis of the left upper arm without change.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 183 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, sodium level of 132 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.8 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen level of 42 mg/dL. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 0.8 mg/dL, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

Radiology imaging reveals severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality in the lung bases, which has been relatively stable. There is no evidence of pneumonia but there might easily go undetected. The heart size is normal, and there is no pleural effusion.

Assessment and plan:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2 requirement with fevers, chills, and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology, likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 6 days ago. He completed 9 days of cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin for healthcare-associated pneumonia, which was discontinued for lack of evidence of pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve, and he has had increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis, antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No fevers since admission, WBC increased over the past 3 days though currently stable. CXR without changes to underlying parenchymal disease but given significant fibrosis, potential infiltrates would be difficult to assess. Etiology of increased WBC unclear, but he is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and fever and leukocytosis may be suppressed in the setting of steroids. Thus, empiric treatment for possible HAP is indicated. However, the likely etiology of his worsening condition is likely progression of his underlying IPF.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 8 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he
   has had increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No fevers since
   admission, WBC increased over past 3 days though currently WNL, CXR
   stable. Started on empiric treatment of Zosyn and Cipro for possible
   HCAP. However, the likely etiology of his worsening condition is likely
   progression of his underlying IPF.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   -Continue Zosyn and Cipro day for HCAP
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
    - Follow SpO2
    - ABG for changing clinical status
   2) Decreased Hct: Down to 28.1. No clear source of blood loss. LDH has
   been elevated throughout stay, so hemolysis labs may be helpful.
   -Hct at 16:00
   -Haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear.
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   3) Elevated WBC: Currently WNL. On steroids, WBC count may be less
   reliable. On empiric antibiotics for HCAP, as per above. UCx pending.
   -Follow up UCx.
   4) Constipation: 1 large BM yesterday.
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Increased Lorazepam yesterday with moderate
   effect. Consider SSRI in outpatient setting.
   -Continue  Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely.
   Hemolysis work up since Hct has dropped.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   -Hemolysis labs per above.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Slightly suboptimal at 28 cc/hr yesterday. LOS fluid balance is
   -7L. Persisent elevated BUN likely reflects pre-renal process, Cr
   stable and WNL.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea thought to be secondary to IPF exacerbation vs. pneumonia. The patient remains on high-flow mask with O2 requirement and is producing moderate to large amounts of white sputum. Sputum culture was collected, and the patient was empirically started on zosyn and cipro. Lorazepam was increased from 0.25 to 0.5 for anxiety. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 111/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula with high-flow oxygen. The patient's general appearance is alert and communicative, with crackles bilaterally on anterior exam. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.4, hemoglobin of 34.0 g/dL, platelet count of 186,000/mm³, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 103 mg/dL, and sodium of 132 mg/dL. The patient's microbiology results are pending. 

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, decreased hematocrit, elevated white blood cell count, constipation, anxiety, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and potential medication response"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 8 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he
   has had increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No clear signs of
   infection given no fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 3
   days but currently WNL, CXR stable. Started on empiric treatment of
   Zosyn and Cipro for possible HCAP. However, the likely etiology of his
   worsening condition is likely progression of his underlying IPF.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   -Continue Zosyn and Cipro day 2 of 14 for HCAP.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough.
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids.
    - Follow SpO2.
    - ABG for changing clinical status.
   2) Decreased Hct: Down to 28.1. No clear source of blood loss. LDH has
   been elevated throughout stay, so hemolysis labs may be helpful.
   -Hct at 12:00.
   -Haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear.
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   3) Elevated WBC: Currently WNL. Rapid drop in WBC likely due to
   starting hemodilution vs. starting antibiotics. On steroids, WBC count
   may be less reliable. On empiric antibiotics for HCAP, as per above.
   UCx pending.
   -Follow up UCx.
   -Continue antibiotics, per above.
   4) Constipation: 1 large BM yesterday.
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Increased Lorazepam yesterday with moderate
   effect. Consider SSRI in outpatient setting.
   -Continue  Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely.
   Hemolysis work up since Hct has dropped.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   -Hemolysis labs per above.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Slightly suboptimal at 28 cc/hr yesterday. LOS fluid balance is
   -7L. Persisent elevated BUN likely reflects persistent pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL. No indication for diuresis based on stable
   respiratory and peripheral exams.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr today.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue methylprednisolone 20 mg IV BID.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: ISS restarted for glucose >150.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 8 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he
   has had increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No clear signs of
   infection given no fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 3
   days but currently WNL, CXR stable. Started on empiric treatment of
   Zosyn and Cipro for possible HCAP. However, the likely etiology of his
   worsening condition is likely progression of his underlying IPF.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   -Continue Zosyn and Cipro day 2 of 14 for HCAP.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough.
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids.
    - Follow SpO2.
    - ABG for changing clinical status.
   2) Decreased Hct: Down to 28.1. No clear source of blood loss. LDH has
   been elevated throughout stay, so hemolysis labs may be helpful.
   -Hct at 12:00.
   -Haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear.
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   3) Elevated WBC: Currently WNL. Rapid drop in WBC likely due to
   starting hemodilution vs. starting antibiotics. On steroids, WBC count
   may be less reliable. On empiric antibiotics for HCAP, as per above.
   UCx pending.
   -Follow up UCx.
   -Continue antibiotics, per above.
   4) Constipation: 1 large BM yesterday.
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Increased Lorazepam yesterday with moderate
   effect. Consider SSRI in outpatient setting.
   -Continue  Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely.
   Hemolysis work up since Hct has dropped.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   -Hemolysis labs per above.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Slightly suboptimal at 28 cc/hr yesterday. LOS fluid balance is
   -7L. Persisent elevated BUN likely reflects persistent pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL. No indication for diuresis based on stable
   respiratory and peripheral exams.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr today.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue methylprednisolone 20 mg IV BID.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: ISS restarted for glucose >150.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   -Place PICC today since he has been refusing blood draws.
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Case manager has located 3 MACU facilities that would
   clinically accept him, when he is clinically stable. Alternatively, he
   may be transferred to [**Hospital6 870**] per his daughter
s wishes if
   possible.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis admitted for dyspnea thought to be secondary to IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. He continues to desaturate to the 80s with any exertion and is producing moderate to large amounts of white sputum. The patient has been started on empiric treatment of Zosyn and Cipro for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 111/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high-flow nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is declining despite optimization with diuretics, antibiotics, and ventilation regimens. He may require further intervention to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2) Decreased Hematocrit (Hct): The patient's Hct has dropped to 28.1%, indicating a possible blood loss or hemolysis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3) Elevated White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Continued monitoring and follow-up of microbiology results are necessary.
4) Constipation: The patient had one large bowel movement yesterday, so it is important to continue"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 8 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he
   has had increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No clear signs of
   infection given no fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 3
   days but currently WNL, CXR stable. Started on empiric treatment of
   Zosyn and Cipro for possible HCAP. However, the likely etiology of his
   worsening condition is likely progression of his underlying IPF.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   -Continue Zosyn and Cipro day 2 of 14 for HCAP.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough.
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids.
    - Follow SpO2.
    - ABG for changing clinical status.
   2) Decreased Hct: Down to 28.1. No clear source of blood loss. LDH has
   been elevated throughout stay, so hemolysis labs may be helpful.
   -Hct at 12:00.
   -Haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear.
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   3) Elevated WBC: Currently WNL. Rapid drop in WBC likely due to
   starting hemodilution vs. starting antibiotics. On steroids, WBC count
   may be less reliable. On empiric antibiotics for HCAP, as per above.
   UCx pending.
   -Follow up UCx.
   -Continue antibiotics, per above.
   4) Constipation: 1 large BM yesterday.
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Increased Lorazepam yesterday with moderate
   effect. Consider SSRI in outpatient setting.
   -Continue  Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely.
   Hemolysis work up since Hct has dropped.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   -Hemolysis labs per above.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Slightly suboptimal at 28 cc/hr yesterday. LOS fluid balance is
   -7L. Persisent elevated BUN likely reflects persistent pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL. No indication for diuresis based on stable
   respiratory and peripheral exams.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr today.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue methylprednisolone 20 mg IV BID.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: ISS restarted for glucose >150.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   -Place PICC today since he has been refusing blood draws.
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Case manager has located 3 MACU facilities that would
   clinically accept him, when he is clinically stable. Alternatively, he
   may be transferred to [**Hospital6 870**] per his daughter
s wishes if
   possible.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, thought to be secondary to IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient is currently on high-flow face mask with declining respiratory status. He has completed 9 days of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia and has increased sputum production despite optimization with diuretics, antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 111/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's general appearance is alert and communicative. Physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally on anterior exam, warm and well-perfused extremities, and a hematoma and ecchymosis on the left anterior arm.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.1 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L, and decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 28.1%. Other labs are within normal range. Microbiology cultures are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has not improved despite antibiotics and ventilation changes. He is likely experiencing an IPF exacerbation.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue Zosyn and Cipro for HCAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   1)  Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased
   O2 requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 8 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he
   has had increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No clear signs of
   infection given no fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 3
   days but currently WNL, CXR stable. Started on empiric treatment of
   Zosyn and Cipro for possible HCAP. However, the likely etiology of his
   worsening condition is likely progression of his underlying IPF.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   -Continue Zosyn and Cipro day 2 of 14 for HCAP.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough.
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids.
    - Follow SpO2.
    - ABG for changing clinical status.
   2) Decreased Hct: Down to 28.1. No clear source of blood loss. LDH has
   been elevated throughout stay, so hemolysis labs may be helpful.
   -Hct at 12:00.
   -Haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear.
   -Guaiac stool.
   - Transfuse for Hct <25.
   3) Elevated WBC: Currently WNL. Rapid drop in WBC likely due to
   starting hemodilution vs. starting antibiotics. On steroids, WBC count
   may be less reliable. On empiric antibiotics for HCAP, as per above.
   UCx pending.
   -Follow up UCx.
   -Continue antibiotics, per above.
   4) Constipation: 1 large BM yesterday.
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Increased Lorazepam yesterday with moderate
   effect. Consider SSRI in outpatient setting.
   -Continue  Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely.
   Hemolysis work up since Hct has dropped.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   -Hemolysis labs per above.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Slightly suboptimal at 28 cc/hr yesterday. LOS fluid balance is
   -7L. Persisent elevated BUN likely reflects persistent pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL. No indication for diuresis based on stable
   respiratory and peripheral exams.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr today.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue methylprednisolone 20 mg IV BID.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: ISS restarted for glucose >150.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   -Place PICC today since he has been refusing blood draws.
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Case manager has located 3 MACU facilities that would
   clinically accept him, when he is clinically stable. Alternatively, he
   may be transferred to [**Hospital6 870**] per his daughter
s wishes if
   possible.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis admitted for dyspnea thought to be secondary to IPF exacerbation vs pneumonia. The patient continues to desaturate to 80s with any exertion and is producing moderate to large amounts of white sputum. He has been started on Zosyn and Cipro empirically for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 111/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's general appearance is alert and communicative, cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, respiratory/chest examination reveals rhonchi bilaterally on anterior exam, and abdominal examination is soft, non-tender with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, sodium of 132 mg/dL, potassium of 0.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 28 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 103 mg/dL, and platelet count of 186 K/uL. Other lab results are within normal limits."

   -Hemolysis labs per above.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Slightly suboptimal at 28 cc/hr yesterday. LOS fluid balance is
   -7L. Persisent elevated BUN likely reflects persistent pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL. No indication for diuresis based on stable
   respiratory and peripheral exams.
     - Goal 30 cc/hr today.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue methylprednisolone 20 mg IV BID.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted for dyspnea, which is thought to be secondary to IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. He is currently on high-flow mask oxygen and producing moderate to large amounts of white sputum. The sputum culture has been collected, and he has been empirically started on Zosyn and Cipro. His anxiety is being managed with lorazepam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening despite optimization with diuresis, antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. This indicates a potential respiratory failure due to the progression of underlying IPF.
2) Decreased Hematocrit (Hct): The patient's Hct has decreased to 28.1%, indicating possible blood loss. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3) Elevated White Blood Cell (WBC) Count: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which could be due to starting hemodilution or antibiotics. Regular monitoring is necessary.
4) Constipation: The patient had one large bowel movement yesterday, indicating a need for continued bowel regimen management.
5) Anxiety/Agitation: The patient's anxiety and agitation are being managed with lorazepam, but close monitoring for delirium and respiratory depression is essential.
6) Elevated Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   # Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2
   requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 8 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he
   has had increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No clear signs of
   infection given no fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 3
   days but currently WNL, CXR stable. Started on empiric treatment of
   Zosyn and Cipro for possible HCAP. However, the likely etiology of his
   worsening condition is likely progression of his underlying IPF.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue Zosyn and Cipro day 2 of 14 for HCAP.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough.
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   - Continue steroids
   - Follow SpO2.
   - ABG/CXR for changing clinical status.
   2) Decreased Hct: Down to 28.1. No clear source of blood loss. LDH has
   been elevated throughout stay, so hemolysis labs may be helpful.
   Patient declining lab draws. No labs for [**8-1**].
   - Hct at 12:00
   - Haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear, guiac stool - recommend
   at [**Hospital3 **]
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   3) Elevated WBC: Currently WNL. Rapid drop in WBC likely due to
   starting hemodilution vs. starting antibiotics. On steroids, WBC count
   may be less reliable. On empiric antibiotics for HCAP, as per above.
   UCx no growth
   - Continue antibiotics, per above.
   - Culture if spikes
   4) Constipation: titrate to bowel movements
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Increased Lorazepam yesterday with moderate
   effect. Consider SSRI in outpatient setting.
   -Continue  Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely.
   Hemolysis work up since Hct has dropped.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   -Hemolysis labs per above.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Slightly suboptimal at 28 cc/hr yesterday. LOS fluid balance is
   -7L. Persisent elevated BUN likely reflects persistent pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL. No indication for diuresis based on stable
   respiratory and peripheral exams.
   - Goal 30 cc/hr today.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue methylprednisolone 20 mg IV BID.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: ISS restarted for glucose >150.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   - Refused PICC, requests PICC to be done at [**Hospital3 **]
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Case manager has located 3 MACU facilities that would
   clinically accept him, when he is clinically stable. To be transfered
   today to [**Hospital6 **] for second opinion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). He was admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient is currently post-extubation and on a high-flow face mask with a declining respiratory status.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He has been treated with various antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), but his oxygen requirement has not improved, and he has increased sputum production. No clear signs of infection are present, and his chest X-ray remains stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76M with IPF admitted for SOB likely IPF exacerbation vs
   pneumonia now post extubation and on high-flow face mask with slowing
   declining respiratory status.
   # Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with SOB and increased O2
   requirement with fevers, chills and leukocytosis. Unclear etiology,
   likely IPF exacerbation. He was extubated 8 days ago. He completed 9
   days of cefepime, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia. His O2 requirement has failed to improve and he
   has had increased sputum production despite optimization with diuresis,
   antibiotics, and changes to ventilation regimens. No clear signs of
   infection given no fevers since admission, WBC increased over past 3
   days but currently WNL, CXR stable. Started on empiric treatment of
   Zosyn and Cipro for possible HCAP. However, the likely etiology of his
   worsening condition is likely progression of his underlying IPF.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue Zosyn and Cipro day 2 of 14 for HCAP.
   - Continue guaifenesin-codeine PRN for cough.
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of steroids
   - Continue steroids
   - Follow SpO2.
   - ABG/CXR for changing clinical status.
   2) Decreased Hct: Down to 28.1. No clear source of blood loss. LDH has
   been elevated throughout stay, so hemolysis labs may be helpful.
   Patient declining lab draws. No labs for [**8-1**].
   - Hct at 12:00
   - Haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear, guiac stool - recommend
   at [**Hospital3 **]
   - Transfuse for Hct <25
   3) Elevated WBC: Currently WNL. Rapid drop in WBC likely due to
   starting hemodilution vs. starting antibiotics. On steroids, WBC count
   may be less reliable. On empiric antibiotics for HCAP, as per above.
   UCx no growth
   - Continue antibiotics, per above.
   - Culture if spikes
   4) Constipation: titrate to bowel movements
    -Continue bowel regimen.
   5) Anxiety/agitation: Increased Lorazepam yesterday with moderate
   effect. Consider SSRI in outpatient setting.
   -Continue  Lorazepam to 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN anxiety.
   -Monitor for delirium and respiratory depression.
   6) Elevated LDH: Etiology unlikely, potentially medication response.
   ALT mildly elevated, AST WNL, making liver disease less likely.
   Hemolysis work up since Hct has dropped.
   -Continue to trend LDH and transaminases.
   -Hemolysis labs per above.
   7) Diet: He has tolerated nectar thick liquids and ground solids with
   1:1 supervision. Continue per speech and swallow.
   -Continue nectar thick liquids.
   8) UOP: Slightly suboptimal at 28 cc/hr yesterday. LOS fluid balance is
   -7L. Persisent elevated BUN likely reflects persistent pre-renal
   process, Cr stable and WNL. No indication for diuresis based on stable
   respiratory and peripheral exams.
   - Goal 30 cc/hr today.
   9) IPF: Steroids tapered to goal of 40 mg.
    -Continue methylprednisolone 20 mg IV BID.
    - Continue NAC.
   10) HTN: Home dose of Imdur has been held due to BP.
   11) CAD:  Continue ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin.
   12) FEN:
   - Continue thickened liquids
   - Glycemic control: ISS restarted for glucose >150.
   13) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker, SCD
   14) Access:
   - Peripheral IV
   - Refused PICC, requests PICC to be done at [**Hospital3 **]
   15) Code: Full confirmed with patient and daughter
    16) Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7534**].
   17) Disposition: Case manager has located 3 MACU facilities that would
   clinically accept him, when he is clinically stable. To be transfered
   today to [**Hospital6 **] for second opinion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), admitted for shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to an IPF exacerbation versus pneumonia. The patient has been extubated and is currently on high-flow face mask with a declining respiratory status.

The patient's family wants to transfer to another hospital for a second opinion and has agreed to be transferred today. The patient refused a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line yesterday but wants it done at the new hospital.

The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) remains above 95% on FiO2 95 with high-flow mask and 6L nasal cannula when eating. The patient's blood glucose levels have been above 150, so insulin sliding scale has been restarted.

The patient has allergies to ace inhibitors due to angioedema. The last doses of antibiotics (Metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam) were given on different dates.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/64 to 140/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 75.5 kg, and height"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to interstitial lung disease (ILD), specifically severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The patient is currently extubated but requires high flow oxygen. 

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), COPD, hypertension, anemia, and altered nutrition. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for increased sputum production. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/59 mmHg to 140/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Physical examination reveals bibasilar rales on chest auscultation and fair air movement. The patient is alert and oriented, able to answer questions through a son who is translating. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 7.6 to 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 28.1% and 34.2 g/dL, platelet count between 167 and 186 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 103 and 156 mg/dL, and liver function tests within normal limits. 

The patient has been diagnosed with ineffective coping, cough, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, coronary artery disease, respiratory failure (not ARDS),"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory failure due to severe IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) with possible superimposed infection.
2. Ineffective coping, which may be related to the patient's inability to breathe properly.
3. Cough.
4. Alteration in nutrition, possibly due to the patient's inability to eat normally.
5. Impaired skin integrity, which could be a result of poor oxygenation or immobility.
6. Coronary artery disease (CAD) or ischemic heart disease, as mentioned in the assessment and plan.
7. Hypotension (not in shock), which may be a result of the respiratory failure or other underlying conditions.
8. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) including IPF, UIP, NSIP, DIP, LIP, etc., which is a broader category that includes conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis.

Please note that this summary is based solely on the information provided in the progress note, and there could be additional complications not mentioned here."
