   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yo F h/o dementia, htn, tia presenting with 10 lb weight
   gain and new lower extremity edema transferred to the CCU for
   hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Acute right-sided heart failure: Patient significantly volume
   overloaded on exam and as evidenced by CXR.  Echo today demonstrated
   preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV
   pressure/volume overload.   The etiology of this RV dilatation is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] pts immobility and age PE is high on the differential.
   Unable to obtain a CTA due to renal function but echo findings could be
   consistent with PE.  She is hypoxic, but not tachycardic, which argues
   against PE. Although EKG on this admission has Q-wave changes there are
   no ST abnormalities and while elevated troponins certainly are
   concerning for ACS this elevation is most like related to her heart
   failure exacerbation.  Q waves may represent recent ischemic event
   causing R heart failure. Finally, she may have another cause of
   pulmonary HTN either subacute or chronic such as intrinsic pulmonary
   disease.  Pt received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an 1 hr.
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix ggt with a goal of approximately 1L given
   patient is significantly preload dependent.
   - Empiric treatment for PE with heparin given clinical picture and echo
   findings.  Positive D-dimer not helpful in this setting.
   - Lower extremity U/S revelead no DVT in either leg
   - CTA in the near future given unclear etiology of heart failure
   exacerbation and once renal function has improved.
   - repeat ECG in AM
   - cont to trend CEs
   - Daily weights
   - Repeat CXR in the AM
   -Patient needs better access will get a PICC line today if pt allows it
   # Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] level of
   consciousness as well as intermittent disorientation.  Differential
   includes worsening of baseline dementia (less likely give
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 226**]) vs acute delirium.  Possible causes of delirium in this
   elderly woman include infection, toxic/metabolic, medications.
   Possible medication culprits include remeron (recently satrted).
   Regarding toxic/metabolic, glucose has been widely fluctuating but
   currently WNL, electrolytes WNL, TSH WNL, BUN elevated but not frankly
   uremic level, patient not currently hypoxic.  Basic infectious w/u
   including blood/urine cx, CXR, without evidence of source.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - hold Remeron
   - avoid psycotropic medications as much as possible
   - evaluate and treat underlying medical issues
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9 now 1.4.  Likely
   secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - diuresis as per above
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - renally dose all meds
   - replete K+ given patient on lasix
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to
   R-->L shunting in the setting of high pulmonary pressure (although
   prior echo - ? if bubble study - commented on lack of PFO).
   - continue to monitor O2 sats and wean O2 as tolerated to keep sats>94%
   - continue to diurese as tolerated
   - continue empiric treatment of PE and consider further eval as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue outpt regimen of synthroid
   .
   # Anorexia:  Daughter and HCP report declining ability to take PO.
   Possibly [**12-27**] worsening dementia vs subacute medical illness.  Remeron
   recently started for this, unclear if this had been helpful.
   - holding remeron given ? AMS possibly related
   - encouraged supervised eating
   - nutrition consult once mental status closer to baseline

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, and transient ischemic attack. She presented with a 10-pound weight gain and new lower extremity edema, and was transferred to the CCU for hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.

Assessment:
1. Acute right-sided heart failure: The patient is significantly volume overloaded, as evidenced by chest X-ray and echocardiogram showing preserved ejection fraction but new severe right ventricular dilatation consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The etiology of this right ventricular dilatation is unclear, but possible causes include pulmonary embolism (PE), immobilization, age-related changes, or another cause of pulmonary hypertension.
2. Confusion/Lethargy: The patient has a waxing and waning level of consciousness and intermittent disorientation. The differential diagnosis includes worsening of baseline dementia or acute delirium. Possible causes of delirium include infection, toxic/metabolic factors, or medications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.9, which has now increased to 1.4. This is likely secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of congestive heart failure.
4. Hypoxia: The patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite receiving 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen, but improved significantly with diuresis. Possible contributing factors include pulmonary edema and"

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, and TIA. She presented with weight gain and new-onset lower extremity edema, and was transferred to the CCU for hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 131/59 mmHg, heart rate of 71 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She has decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally and is able to move all four extremities. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), with a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL and BUN of 26 mg/dL. The patient has an elevated troponin level of 0.46 ng/mL, but normal electrolyte levels. 

The assessment and plan include treatment for acute right-sided heart failure, confusion/lethargy, acute renal failure, hypoxia, hypothyroidism, anorexia, and poor oral intake. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of heart failure exacerbation, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury, delirium, and malnutrition."

   hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Acute right-sided heart failure: Patient significantly volume
   overloaded on exam and as evidenced by CXR.  Echo today demonstrated
   preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV
   pressure/volume overload.   The etiology of this RV dilatation is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] pts immobility and age PE is high on the differential.
   Unable to obtain a CTA due to renal function but echo findings could be
   consistent with PE.  She is hypoxic, but not tachycardic, which argues
   against PE. Although EKG on this admission has Q-wave changes there are
   no ST abnormalities and while elevated troponins certainly are
   concerning for ACS this elevation is most like related to her heart
   failure exacerbation.  Q waves may represent recent ischemic event
   causing R heart failure. Finally, she may have another cause of
   pulmonary HTN either subacute or chronic such as intrinsic pulmonary
   disease.  Pt received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an 1 hr.
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix bolus
   - Continue treatment with Heparin .  ? Warfarin bridge

   # Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] level of
   consciousness as well as intermittent disorientation.  Differential
   includes worsening of baseline dementia (less likely give
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 226**]) vs acute delirium.  Possible causes of delirium in this
   elderly woman include infection, toxic/metabolic, medications.
   Possible medication culprits include remeron (recently satrted).
   Regarding toxic/metabolic, glucose has been widely fluctuating but
   currently WNL, electrolytes WNL, TSH WNL, BUN elevated but not frankly
   uremic level, patient not currently hypoxic.  Basic infectious w/u
   including blood/urine cx, CXR, without evidence of source.

   - renally dose all meds
   - replete K+ given patient on lasix

   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, and transient ischemic attack. She was admitted to the CCU with symptoms of hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. The patient presented with significant weight gain and lower extremity edema, indicating possible fluid overload. A chest X-ray revealed evidence of pulmonary edema, and an echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction but new severe right ventricular dilatation consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The cause of this right ventricular dilatation is unclear.

The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome, and chronic or subacute intrinsic pulmonary disease. The patient received an IV bolus of lasix and diuresed nearly 1 liter in one hour. She will continue to be treated with heparin and may undergo a warfarin bridge. Renal function is currently at 1.4 creatinine, and a CT angiogram will be considered in the near future due to the unclear etiology of heart failure exacerbation.

The patient also has confusion/lethargy with intermittent disorientation. Possible causes include worsening of baseline dementia, acute delirium, infection, toxic/metabolic, or medications. The recent initiation of Remeron could be a potential culprit for delirium. Basic infectious workup has been done without evidence of infection. Mental status improved this morning"

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, and TIA. She presented with weight gain, new-onset lower extremity edema, hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She was transferred to the CCU for further evaluation and management.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Acute right-sided heart failure: The patient is significantly volume overloaded, as evidenced by examination findings and a chest X-ray. An echocardiogram today showed preserved ejection fraction but new severe right ventricular dilatation consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The etiology of this dilatation is unclear, but possibilities include pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic pulmonary disease, or a recent ischemic event causing right heart failure. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) has been ordered to evaluate for possible PE.

2. Confusion/Lethargy: The patient exhibits a waxing and waning level of consciousness with intermittent disorientation. The differential includes worsening of baseline dementia or acute delirium. Possible causes of delirium in this elderly woman include infection, toxic/metabolic, or medications. The recent start of Remeron (an antidepressant) may also be a contributing factor. Basic infectious workup, including blood and urine cultures, has been performed without evidence of infection. Mental status has improved this morning, and further blood cultures will be followed up.

   - renally dose all meds
   - replete K+ given patient on lasix

   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to
   R-->L shunting in the setting of high pulmonary pressure (although
   prior echo - ? if bubble study - commented on lack of PFO).
   - Pt on room air  satting well.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Acute Right-Sided Heart Failure: The patient is significantly volume overloaded and has evidence of right ventricular (RV) dilatation on echocardiogram. This could be due to pulmonary embolism (PE), immobility, or age-related factors.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: Given the patient's immobility, age, and the presence of RV dilatation, PE is a high possibility. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been ordered to evaluate for PE.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.9, but it has now increased to 1.4. This could be secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of congestive heart failure (CHF).

4. Confusion/Lethargy: The patient is experiencing intermittent disorientation and a fluctuating level of consciousness. This could be due to worsening of baseline dementia, acute delirium, or another cause.

5. Hypoxia: The patient initially had hypoxia on the floor despite being on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. However, the hypoxia improved significantly with diuresis. Possible contributing factors include pulmonary edema and PE.

6. Anorexia: The patient has a declining ability to take oral intake, possibly due to worsening dementia or subacute medical illness.

7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, likely secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide appropriate treatment and interventions to prevent these complications from worsening."

   - replete K+ given patient on lasix
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to
   R-->L shunting in the setting of high pulmonary pressure (although
   prior echo - ? if bubble study - commented on lack of PFO).
   - continue to monitor O2 sats and wean O2 as tolerated to keep sats>94%
   - continue to diurese as tolerated
   - continue empiric treatment of PE and consider further eval as above

   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue outpt regimen of synthroid
   .
   # Anorexia:  Daughter and HCP report declining ability to take PO.
   Possibly [**12-27**] worsening dementia vs subacute medical illness.  Remeron
   recently started for this, unclear if this had been helpful.
   - holding remeron given ? AMS possibly related
   - encouraged supervised eating
   - nutrition consult once mental status closer to baseline

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, and previous transient ischemic attack (TIA). She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) due to weight gain, new-onset lower extremity edema, hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. The patient's current condition includes acute right-sided heart failure, confusion/lethargy, acute renal failure, hypoxia, and anorexia. She is being treated with diuretics, heparin, and other medications. Further diagnostic tests and interventions are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Right-Sided Heart Failure: The patient's echocardiogram shows preserved left ventricular ejection fraction but new severe right ventricular dilatation, which is consistent with right-sided heart failure. This can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary hypertension, and further complications.

2. Confusion/Lethargy: The patient's mental status is fluctuating, with intermittent disorientation and a reduced level of consciousness. The differential diagnosis includes worsening of baseline dementia, acute delirium, and potential causes such as infection, toxic/metabolic disturbances, or medication side effects.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased from 0.9 to 1.4. This is likely secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of congestive heart failure. The patient's renal function needs close"
