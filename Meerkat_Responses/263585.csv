","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. He presented with unstable angina, EKG changes, and a small troponin leak. He has been placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. His vital signs are stable, and his laboratory results show some abnormalities in electrolyte levels and renal function. He has a history of chronic renal failure and is being closely monitored for any complications related to his medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of severe three-vessel coronary artery disease and unstable angina, there is a risk of further cardiac complications during and after CABG surgery.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.3-1.5, indicating chronic renal failure. Any additional stress on the kidneys during surgery or from medications could potentially worsen his renal function.
3. Bleeding/Oozing: The patient experienced slight oozing at the femoral catheter site. There is a risk of bleeding complications during and after the surgical procedure.
4. Infection: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and severe three-vessel disease. The patient presented with unstable angina and ST depressions in leads V2-V4. The patient also had a small troponin leak (<0.01 to 0.02), but the CK level improved. 

The patient is currently on bedrest and receiving a nitroglycerin drip at 0.05mg/min. The patient is also on simvastatin 80mg, lisinopril 40mg, metoprolol 62.5mg, and ASA 325mg. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), a heart rate of 60 bpm (58-68 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 129/50mmHg to 146/61mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (14-19 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals a first-degree AV block, with visible pulsations at the angle of the jaw at 15-20%. The patient's cardiac enzymes show a CK level of 202, which decreased to 114, and a troponin-T level of <0.01 to 0.02.
