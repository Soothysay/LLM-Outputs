   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, no resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1). Likely source is pulmonary given clinical symptoms
   and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate .  Other sources include
   abdomen given h/o C. diff, but without localizing abd symptoms. UA neg.
   No other clear source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-).
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - cont broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco (MRSA + in past),
   Cefepime (pseudommonal coverage given COPD and frequent
   hospitalizations) and levo (will consider dc levo if no worsening of
   sepsis and QTc continues to rise, currently 459, given (-) legionella).
   - will cont flagyl for c. diff coverage until stool c. diff (-)
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   -  f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  . CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Being treated w/ Cefep/Vanco/levo/flagyl.  Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload on exam or
   CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - cont methylpred 60mg q6
   - treat with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - hold home lasix for now
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.4. Pt is
   on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - re-start dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload
   - TTE

   unrevealing to date. Agree with plan to continue broad empiric antibx
   coverage (vanco, cef, flagyl, levo), tapering per cx data over the next
   1-2 days. It is reasonable to continue levo for atypical coverage,
   monitoring ecg and Qtc. NSTEMI/troponin elevation is likely related to
   demand ischemia in pt with severe AS in setting of tachycardia and
   hypot. His CEs have peaked at 0.2 and are now trending down. Will
   obtain TTE to reassess cardiac fx, continue asa, start statin and
   notify pts cardiologist  His air movement remains poor and he is
   wheezy
would continue current dose of steroids and NEBS for COPD
   flare. Continue using intermittent NiPPV, monitoring abgs/signs of
   fatigue. His hypotension and tachycardia have resolved with IVFs and he
   is now af with improving leukocytosis. Would resume low dose rate
   control regimen (on CCB at home).  Keep NPO given tenuous resp status.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis, and recent hospitalizations. He presents with sepsis, respiratory distress, and cardiac ischemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of improvement with the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.
2. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD and is experiencing increased work of breathing and shortness of breath. He was placed on BiPAP but transitioned back to baseline 2L NC due to desaturation. It is likely a COPD exacerbation exacerbated by sepsis.
3. Cardiac Ischemia/NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels have been trending up since admission, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. The patient has been started on aspirin and statins for NSTEMI management.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient appears euvolemic on examination, and there are no signs of acute exacerbation on the chest X-ray. Monitoring volume status and holding"

   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Had an elevated lactate, no resolved (high 4.0, now 1.1)
   and was transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the ICU,
   responsive to 600mL IVF. Likely source is pulmonary given clinical
   symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate .  Other
   sources include abdomen given h/o C. diff, but without localizing abd
   symptoms. UA neg. No other clear source of infection.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain CVP 8-12, MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - cont broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco (MRSA + in past),
   Cefepime (pseudommonal coverage given COPD and frequent
   hospitalizations) and levo (legionella coverage).
   - will cont flagyl for c. diff coverage until stool c. diff (-)
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u legionella antigen
   -  f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  . CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - repeat TTE today
   - consult cards for possible cath after sepsis/infection has resolved
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   .
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Being treated w/ Cefep/Vanco/levo/flagyl.  Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload on exam or
   CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - cont methylpred 60mg q6
   - treat with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo
   - f/u CXR

   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - hold home lasix for now

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, atrial fibrillation, diastolic CHF, and aortic stenosis. He presents with sepsis and respiratory distress. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD and is experiencing increased work of breathing and shortness of breath. There is a possibility of a COPD exacerbation, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's troponin levels have been trending up since admission, indicating potential cardiac ischemia. This could be due to demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia, or possibly a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

3. Diastolic CHF: Although the patient appears euvolemic on examination, there is a concern for diastolic CHF exacerbation. However, the patient's BNP levels are stable and the CXR does not show signs of acute exacerbation.

4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a valve area of 1.0 cm, indicating severe aortic stenosis. Close monitoring is necessary as the patient is preload-dependent.

5. Potential Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has tachycardia and an elevated D-dimer level, which raises concern for a possible pulmonary embolism."

   was essentially unchanged from prior. We continue asa and statin and
   home regimen of lasix and dilt.  We continue to hold his coumadin given
   supra-therapeutic INR. His air movement is improving but he remains
   wheezy--would start slow steroid taper, continuing NEBS for COPD
   flare. Would continue NiPPV intermittently.  He apparently has BiPAP at
   home, but does not use.  Would benefit from this as outpt given his
   chronic CO2 retention. Will monitor his lactate.  Remainder of plan as
   outlined in resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis, and recent admission for COPD exacerbation. He presents with sepsis and respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has an elevated lactate level indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. He has positive C. difficile (C. diff) status and his CXR shows improvement from prior. The patient's cardiac enzymes are stable, but there is evidence of NSTEMI due to demand ischemia. The plan includes continuing BIPAP, nebs, methylprednisolone, and adjusting antibiotics for potential infection etiologies. Additionally, the patient's DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP precautions should be followed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and increased work of breathing suggest the possibility of hypercapneic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and follow-up ABG are recommended.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria and has an elevated lactate level, indicating possible sepsis. IV fluid boluses and appropriate antibiotic coverage should be continued.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure: Although the patient appears euvolemic, there is a possibility of diastolic CHF due to his pre-existing condition. Monitoring"

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   .
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Receiving nebs and methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No
   evidence of overload on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg q6h
   - adjust abx as below for potential infx etiologies
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased today so will avoid meds
   accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco for C diff
   - d/c IV Vanco/ cefepime/levo
 change to doxycycline 100 [**Hospital1 **] for
   atypical coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   .
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - hold home lasix for now
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.6 today.
   Pt is on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - re-start dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis, and previous myocardial infarction. He presented with sepsis and respiratory distress. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications including atorvastatin, famotidine, and methylprednisolone. His vital signs include a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 80/50 mmHg to 99/65 mmHg, heart rate of 70-114 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 2L nasal cannula. He is also on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 524-690 mL, respiratory rate of 22, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. His ABG results show pH 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) 99%. Physical examination reveals mild labored breathing, scattered wheezes throughout, no rales or rhonchi, and warm, well-perfused extremities. Laboratory findings include elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels"

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   .
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Receiving nebs and methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No
   evidence of overload on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg q6h
   - adjust abx as below for potential infx etiologies
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased today so will avoid meds
   accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco for C diff
   - d/c IV Vanco/ cefepime/levo
 change to doxycycline 100 [**Hospital1 **] for
   atypical coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - repeat ABG later today for lactate
   .
   # Hematuria
 while examining pt with team today, red urine noted in
   foley bag. Uncertain etiology given Cr and HCT stable. Most likely
   traumatic foley
   - f/u UA
   .
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - restart home lasix 30 po daily
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.6 today.
   Pt is on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - cont dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload

","The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. He has a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient was placed on non-invasive ventilation due to worsening respiratory status but had to be discontinued due to hematuria in Foley catheter. A urinalysis was sent to investigate the cause. The Foley catheter was replaced and the patient was placed on continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) because clots were found in the Foley catheter. The patient's EKG showed prolonged QT interval in the morning, which resolved to normal in the evening. Dofetilide was discontinued.

The patient has allergies to amiodarone, worsening COPD, Proscar (Finasteride), breast sensitivity, and sotalol. The last dose of antibiotics given to the patient was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 07/18/2159 at 01:54 PM. Levofloxacin was given on 07/19/2159 at 07:30 AM, metronidazole on 07/20/2159 at 12:08 AM, cefipime on 07/20/2159 at 08:00 AM, and vancomycin on 07/21/2159 at 06:18 AM.

The patient is receiving various medications including famotidine (Pepcid) and other ICU medications. Other medications include unspecified drugs.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's flow sheet data shows stable vital signs and fluid balance within normal limits. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is ventilating adequately with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced.

The patient's current weight is 82.3 kg, which is slightly higher than the admission weight of 79.5 kg. The patient's height is 70 inches.

The patient has received a total of 2,070 mL of IV fluids since midnight, including 311 mL of 0.9% NaCl and 1,590 mL of 0.45% NaCl. The patient has also received 480 mL of PO fluids and 240 mL of TF fluids. The patient has had a total output of 1,000 mL of urine and 400 mL of blood products. The patient has had a negative NG output and no stool output. The patient has had a drain placed but no output recorded.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, there are several significant events that occurred within the 24-hour period. Firstly, the patient experienced hematuria in Foley, and it was unclear if this was due to a traumatic catheterization. A urine analysis was sent for further evaluation. Secondly, the patient had low urine output and clots were found in the Foley catheter. The Foley catheter was replaced and the patient was placed on continuous bladder irrigation (CBI). Thirdly, the patient had prolonged QT on the EKG in the morning, which resolved to normal by the evening. Dofetilide was discontinued.

The patient has several allergies, including amiodarone, worsening COPD, Proscar (Oral) (Finasteride), breast sensitivities, and unknown allergies to sotalol. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on July 18th, Levofloxacin on July 19th, Metronidazole on July 20th, Cefepime on July 20th, and Vancomycin on July 21st.

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Receiving nebs and methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No
   evidence of overload on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg q6h
   - adjust abx as below for potential infx etiologies
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased today so will avoid meds
   accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco for C diff
   - d/c IV Vanco/ cefepime/levo
 change to doxycycline 100 [**Hospital1 **] for
   atypical coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - repeat ABG later today for lactate
   .
   # Hematuria
 while examining pt with team today, red urine noted in
   foley bag. Uncertain etiology given Cr and HCT stable. Most likely
   traumatic foley
   - f/u UA
   .
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - restart home lasix 30 po daily
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.6 today.
   Pt is on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - cont dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload
   - TTE

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, diastolic CHF, and aortic stenosis. He presents with sepsis and respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, but using accessory muscles for breathing and has scattered wheezes throughout the lungs.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.1 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's EKG shows a prolonged QT interval. The urinalysis reveals gross blood without nitrites or leukocytes. Blood cultures are negative for growth, and sputum culture is contaminated.

The patient's condition is being managed with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, methylprednisolone, and antibiotics. The plan is to continue with close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, ABG oxygenation, and adjustment of antibiotics based on potential infectious etiologies. The patient's cardiac ischemia is being monitored with repeat troponin T and CK-MB levels. The patient's diastolic CH"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, atrial fibrillation, diastolic CHF, aortic stenosis, and a recent myocardial infarction. He presented with sepsis and respiratory distress, likely due to an acute exacerbation of his COPD. The patient has been placed on BiPAP and is receiving nebs and methylprednisolone. His ABG oxygenation has improved, but he continues to require close monitoring of his respiratory status.

The patient also has signs of cardiac ischemia, possibly a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia. Aspirin and lipitor have been started, and a beta-blocker may be considered after evaluation. An echocardiogram is needed to assess cardiac function.

Hematuria was observed, and clots were found in the bladder. The patient has been started on continuous bladder irrigation (CBI), and the hematuria has resolved. The urinalysis is negative for infection, so follow-up with urology is recommended.

The patient appears euvolemic on examination, indicating no acute exacerbation of diastolic CHF. BNP levels are within normal range. The patient will be monitored closely for any changes in volume status.

The patient's aortic stenosis valve area is 1.0"

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Acute COPD exacerbation: The patient presented with hypercapneic
   Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with increased WOB
   and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to baseline 2L NC
   (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation in the setting
   of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given tachycardia, although
   pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-). Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload
   on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - Given doxycycline (treatment started on [**7-18**]). Will treat for 7 days
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Will switch to PO tomorrow.
   - adjust abx as below for potential infx etiologies
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased so will avoid meds accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco (started [**6-22**]) for C diff  for a [**10-3**] day
   course
   - Follow-up blood culture
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin at home. Pt
   currently on dilt. Dofetilide held due to increased QT interval (due to
   concominant use of Levaquin).
   - cont dilt at
 home dose
   - Since QT normal, start Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - INR therapeutic, so will start home dose of Coumadin 5 mg today
   - Patient needs a TTE
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  patient had a troponin leak in the context of
   respiratory distress.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to demand
   ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - Started on lipitor
   - Consider a beta blocker, however, patient has COPD so worry about
   side effects
   - needs TTE
   # Hematuria
 Patient had hematuria. Found to have clots in his
   bladder. Started CBI and urology said can D/C it. Hematuria resolved in
   AM. U/A negative for infection
   - Need to f/u with urology.
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - On home lasix 30 po daily
   .
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload
   - TTE
   .

   MICU Attending  Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the above note by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7523**]
   and agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 2964**] has very
   severe COPD which he feels is nearly back to baseline, though he
   remains of high dose steroids, Nebs, O2, and antibiotics for his COPD
   flare. He was able to go without using BIPAP last night. Steroids are
   being tapered slowly.
    His CDiff is being Rx
d with po Vanco, and he is showing no signs of
   the sepsis that brought him into MICU. Prlonged QT has been corrected
   by stopping dofetilide and levaquin. Dofetilide will be reintroduced.
   If he continues to look and feel well throughout the day he may be
   called out to the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, atrial fibrillation, diastolic CHF, and aortic stenosis. He presents with sepsis, respiratory distress, and suspected myocardial infarction. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute COPD exacerbation, sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hematuria, diastolic CHF, aortic stenosis, and Clostridium difficile infection. He is currently receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute COPD Exacerbation: The patient's severe COPD has led to an acute exacerbation, characterized by increased work of breathing and shortness of breath. He is receiving nebulizers, methylprednisolone, and BiPAP support.
2. Sepsis: The patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis. He was initially hypotensive but responded to IV fluids. There is an elevated lactate level indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. The likely source of infection is pulmonary, but other sources should be considered.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient had a troponin leak during respiratory distress, suggesting a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This could be due to demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
4. Hematuria: The"
