   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. In some views, a linear/filamentous mobile echodensity is
   seen on the right atrial side of the valve c/w
   ?artifact/thrombus/vegetation. There is mild tricuspid regurgitation.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no

 ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 57 year old man with pmh IV drug use,
   SLE, endocarditis, presenting with three days of gastrointestinal
   symptoms, followed by intense left hip pain, along with multiple lab
   abnormalities including bandemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated
   transaminases, and coagulopathy
   .
   #hypotension/fevers: likely [**1-29**] septic shock. no reason to believe he
   would be in cardiogenic shock.
   -will continue to bolus and use pressors as appropriate
   -monitor cardiac output c vigileo
   -continue broad spectrum abx
   -continue to search for source infection
   -re source: ? veg on tricuspid valve + emboli in lungs and spleen +
   bandemia on admission + s aureus UTI
   -TEE today
   -f/u cultures
   .
   #Respiratory status: currently intubated, on assist control but not on
   ardsnet protocol
   -pt does meet ardsnet protocol based on Aa gradient and b/l infiltrates
   (though not totally typical for ards).
   -will start ardsnet settings
   -will sedate appropriately c fentanyl and midaz aiming for pt being
   synchronous c vent c no more than [**1-30**] extra breaths/min
   .
   # Hip Pain: septic arthritis vs. bursitis vs. inflammatory
   arthropathy.  Hip CT was unremarkable.  pain and bandemia, low grade
   temperature is concerning for septic joint.
   -MRI to assess for effusion
   -IR guided joint tap if there is something to tap.
   - call ortho prn
   .
   # tachycardia: could be hypotension as well as pain. also concerned for
   EtOH withdrawal
   -would switch propofol to midaz out of concern for etoh withdrawal
   -initially felt to be hypovolemia but think that pt is adequately
   repleted at this point
   .
   #: Acid base status: ABG c/w nongap acidosis. likely from volume
   repletion. will trend.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal as improved with IVF.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Unsure if new, possibly from sepsis vs. DIC
   vs/viral illness.
   -trend
   -smear for schistocytes does not show significant schistos
   -f/u HIV
   .
   # Microcytic anemia:
   -iron studies show iron def anemia and elev ferritin in setting of
   acute inflammation, would consider iv iron after pt over acute
   infectious illness
   -hemolysis labs reassuring (LDH elevated, but no sig indir bili,
   haptoglobin wnl)
   -consider Hemoglobin electropheresis
   .
   # Liver abnormalities: Mildly elevated transaminases along with direct
   hyperbilirubinemia. RUQUS showed GB sludge.  Potentially from
   intrahepatic cholestasis from sepsis, hepatitis from infection.
   -check hepatitis serologies, autoimmune serologies
   .
   #Splenic Hypodensities: hyperechoic lesions apparent on Ultrasound.
   uncertain if consistent with abscess vs. cyst vs. infarction.
   -touch base with radiology
   -abdominal CT scan.

","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and endocarditis. He presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, intense left hip pain, and multiple lab abnormalities including bandemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, respiratory failure, impaired health maintenance, and pain control. 

The patient's medical history includes IV drug use, SLE, and endocarditis. He has been admitted with gastrointestinal symptoms, left hip pain, and lab abnormalities. 

Key findings from the medical chart include:
- Septic shock with hypotension and fever
- Respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation
- Impaired health maintenance with multiple organ dysfunction
- Pain control due to acute and chronic pain
- Bacterial endocarditis with possible vegetation on the tricuspid valve
- Septic emboli in the lungs and spleen
- Bandemia (increased white blood cell count)
- S. aureus urinary tract infection
- Hip pain suggesting septic arthritis, bursitis, or inflammatory arthropathy
- Lytic lesion in the iliacs, possibly from a bone scan
- Trace pelvic free fluid
- LAD coronary artery disease (CAD)
- MRI hip pending
- Microbiology showing Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters

   No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is likely partial flail of the anterior
   tricuspid valve leaflet with possible leaflet perforation without
   evidence of a tricuspid valve abscess. There is a large vegetation
   measuring 2.8 cm by 1.7 cm in largest dimension on the atrial side of
   the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Severe [4+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion and a
   small complex left pleural effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Large tricuspid valve vegetation with partial flail and
   possible perforation of the anterior tricuspid valve leaflet in the

   Imaging: TEE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
   left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
   No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is likely partial flail of the anterior
   tricuspid valve leaflet with possible leaflet perforation without
   evidence of a tricuspid valve abscess. There is a large vegetation
   measuring 2.8 cm by 1.7 cm in largest dimension on the atrial side of
   the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Severe [4+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion and a
   small complex left pleural effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Large tricuspid valve vegetation with partial flail and
   possible perforation of the anterior tricuspid valve leaflet in the
   setting of severe tricuspid regurgitation. Small pericardial and
   complex pleural effusion.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 57 year old man with pmh IV drug use,
   SLE, endocarditis, presenting with three days of gastrointestinal
   symptoms, followed by intense left hip pain, along with multiple lab
   abnormalities including bandemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated
   transaminases, and coagulopathy found to have a large vegetation on
   tricuspid valve.
   .
   #sepsis/endocarditis: pt c vegetation on tricuspid valve, lesions in
   lungs, bursiitis in L hip, splenic abscesses, staph aureus growing from
   urine. likely all of these are [**1-29**] staph aureus endocarditis [**1-29**] IVDU.
   -f/u all cultures and sensitivities. urine staph sensitivities likely
   back today, will call micro lab
   -ID and CT [**Doctor First Name **] consulted
   -ortho consulted
   -will continue to bolus and use pressors as appropriate
   -continue broad spectrum [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be able to narrow later today
   .
   #Respiratory status: currently intubated, on assist control but not on
   ardsnet protocol
   -pt does meet ardsnet protocol based on Aa gradient and b/l infiltrates
   (though not totally typical for ards).
   -will start ardsnet settings
   -will sedate appropriately c fentanyl and midaz aiming for pt being
   synchronous c vent c no more than [**1-30**] extra breaths/min
   .
   # Hip Pain: septic arthritis vs. bursitis vs. inflammatory
   arthropathy.  Hip CT was unremarkable.  pain and bandemia, low grade
   temperature is concerning for septic joint.
   -MRI to assess for effusion
   -IR guided joint tap if there is something to tap.
   - call ortho prn
   .
   # tachycardia: could be hypotension as well as pain. also concerned for
   EtOH withdrawal
   -would switch propofol to midaz out of concern for etoh withdrawal
   -initially felt to be hypovolemia but think that pt is adequately
   repleted at this point
   .
   #: Acid base status: ABG c/w nongap acidosis. likely from volume
   repletion. will trend.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal as improved with IVF.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Unsure if new, possibly from sepsis vs. DIC
   vs/viral illness.
   -trend
   -smear for schistocytes does not show significant schistos
   -HIV serology negative, could encourage pt to repeat in 3 months
   -RUQ u/s did not show cirrhosis
   .
   # Microcytic anemia:
   -iron studies show iron def anemia and elev ferritin in setting of
   acute inflammation, would consider iv iron after pt over acute
   infectious illness
   -hemolysis labs reassuring (LDH elevated, but no sig indir bili,
   haptoglobin wnl)
   -consider Hemoglobin electropheresis
   .
   # Liver abnormalities: Mildly elevated transaminases along with direct
   hyperbilirubinemia. RUQ US showed GB sludge.  Potentially from
   intrahepatic cholestasis from sepsis, hepatitis from infection.
   -hep c antibody positive. will check HCV pcr and do genotype
   -hep b core and surface antibody pos, c/w prior infection. pt should
   not get steroids unless absolutely necessary (and in that case may need
   ppx)
   -will need liver f/u as outpt

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of intravenous drug use, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and endocarditis. The patient presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, intense left hip pain, and multiple lab abnormalities including bandemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases, and coagulopathy. 

The patient has a large vegetation on the tricuspid valve, which is likely due to Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, a common infection among intravenous drug users. There are also lesions in the lungs, bursitis in the left hip, and splenic abscesses, all of which are consistent with disseminated staphylococcal infection. 

The patient is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the urine culture is pending. The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and he should be transitioned to ARDSnet settings.

The patient's hip pain may be due to septic arthritis or bursitis. An MRI is planned to assess for effusion, and an IR-guided joint tap may be performed if there is something to tap. 

The patient's tachycardia could be due to hypotension, pain, or ethanol withdrawal. The acid-base status shows nongap acidosis, likely from volume repletion. Acute renal failure is suspected"

   left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
   No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is likely partial flail of the anterior
   tricuspid valve leaflet with possible leaflet perforation without
   evidence of a tricuspid valve abscess. There is a large vegetation
   measuring 2.8 cm by 1.7 cm in largest dimension on the atrial side of
   the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Severe [4+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion and a
   small complex left pleural effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Large tricuspid valve vegetation with partial flail and
   possible perforation of the anterior tricuspid valve leaflet in the
   setting of severe tricuspid regurgitation. Small pericardial and
   complex pleural effusion.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of IV drug use, SLE, and endocarditis. He presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, intense left hip pain, and multiple lab abnormalities including bandemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases, and coagulopathy. The patient has a large vegetation on the tricuspid valve and is diagnosed with sepsis and endocarditis caused by MRSA.

The patient is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation but does not meet the criteria for ARDS. The plan is to start ARDSnet settings and sedate appropriately. The patient also has tachycardia, possibly due to hypotension, pain, or EtOH withdrawal. Acid-base status shows nongap acidosis likely from volume repletion. Acute renal failure is suspected to be prerenal and has improved with IVF. Thrombocytopenia may be due to sepsis, DIC, or viral illness. Microcytic anemia is likely iron deficiency anemia with elevated ferritin in the setting of acute inflammation. Liver abnormalities include mildly elevated transaminases and direct hyperbilirubinemia, possibly from intrahepatic cholestasis from sepsis or hepatitis from infection. The patient is positive for Hepatitis C antibody and Hepatitis B core and surface antibody.

The patient's current medications include vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, and phenylephrine. The patient's blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine culture are pending. The plan includes following up with all cultures and sensitivities, consulting with an Infectious Disease specialist, and considering orthopedic consultation regarding bursitis in the L hip. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis are also being addressed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, further spread of infection to other organs, development of renal failure, persistent thrombocytopenia, and ongoing liver abnormalities."

The respiratory status is concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's heart rate is approximately 100 bpm, which could be due to hypotension, pain, or possible ethanol withdrawal. There is evidence of acute renal failure, possibly pre-renal in nature, and thrombocytopenia that may be related to sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or viral illness.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 57 year old man with pmh IV drug use,
   SLE, endocarditis, presenting with three days of gastrointestinal
   symptoms, followed by intense left hip pain, along with multiple lab
   abnormalities including bandemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated
   transaminases, and coagulopathy found to have a large vegetation on
   tricuspid valve.
   .
   #sepsis/endocarditis: pt c vegetation on tricuspid valve, lesions in
   lungs, bursiitis in L hip, splenic abscesses, MRSA growing from urine.
   likely all of these are [**1-29**] staph aureus endocarditis [**1-29**] IVDU.
   -f/u all cultures and sensitivities
   -ID recommends continue vancomycin
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **] consulted, final recs pending
   -IP not able to tap small pleural effusion
   -will continue to bolus and use pressors as appropriate
   -will continue just vancomycin for goal trough 15-20. will stop
   ceftriaxone and levo. Check another trough tomorrow
   .
   #Respiratory status: currently intubated, on assist control but not on
   ardsnet protocol
   -pt does meet ardsnet protocol based on Aa gradient and b/l infiltrates
   (though not totally typical for ards).
   -will continue ards settings
   -consider weaning as pt's resp status improves
   -continue sedation c fent midaz
   .
   # tachycardia: could be hypotension as well as pain. also concerned for
   EtOH withdrawal
   -continues to have HR of 100 which is much improved over admission HR
   of 150-160s.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Initially likely prerenal as improved with IVF.
   Now mildly worsening. Perhaps this is ATN [**1-29**] hypotension or vancomycin
   toxicity.
   Will continue to trend. Bolus for UOP <30cc/hr.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Unsure if new, possibly from sepsis vs. DIC
   vs/viral illness.
   -trend
   -smear for schistocytes does not show significant schistos
   -HIV serology negative, could encourage pt to repeat in 3 months
   -RUQ u/s did not show cirrhosis
   .
   # Microcytic anemia:
   -iron studies show iron def anemia and elev ferritin in setting of
   acute inflammation, would consider iv iron after pt over acute
   infectious illness
   -hemolysis labs reassuring (LDH elevated, but no sig indir bili,
   haptoglobin wnl)
   -consider Hemoglobin electropheresis
   .
   # Liver abnormalities: Mildly elevated transaminases along with direct
   hyperbilirubinemia. RUQ US showed GB sludge.  Potentially from
   intrahepatic cholestasis from sepsis, hepatitis from infection.
   -hep c antibody positive. HCV PCR pending
   -hep b core and surface antibody pos, c/w prior infection. pt should
   not get steroids unless absolutely necessary (and in that case may need

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of intravenous drug use, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and endocarditis. He presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, intense left hip pain, and multiple lab abnormalities including bandemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases, and coagulopathy. A large vegetation was found on the tricuspid valve.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and endocarditis, with MRSA growing from urine. The likely causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis related to intravenous drug use. The patient also has lesions in the lungs, bursitis in the left hip, and a splenic abscess.

The patient is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure but does not meet the ARDSnet protocol criteria. The plan is to continue ARDS settings and consider weaning as the patient's respiratory status improves.

The patient's tachycardia could be due to hypotension, pain, or ethanol withdrawal. His heart rate has improved from admission levels of 150-160 bpm to the current level of 100 bpm.

The patient initially had acute renal failure, which improved with intravenous fluids but is now mildly worsening. It may be due to hypotension or vancomycin toxicity. The plan is to trend the"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and endocarditis.
- He presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, intense left hip pain, and multiple lab abnormalities.
- He has a large vegetation on the tricuspid valve, lung lesions, bursitis in the left hip, and a splenic abscess.
- Cultures are pending, but MRSA has grown from urine, suggesting a possible Staphylococcus aureus infection related to endocarditis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of multiple infections, including endocarditis, lung lesions, bursitis, and a splenic abscess.
2. Endocarditis: The large vegetation on the tricuspid valve indicates endocarditis, which can lead to further complications such as heart valve damage, embolic events, and systemic infection.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on assist control but not on the ARDSnet protocol. There is a concern for weaning off the ventilator as the respiratory status improves.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia in the 130s, which could be due to hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of intravenous drug use, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and endocarditis. He presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, intense left hip pain, and multiple lab abnormalities. The patient has a large vegetation on the tricuspid valve and lesions in the lungs, as well as a splenic abscess. MRSA is growing from urine, and it is likely all of these are due to Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis caused by IV drug use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis due to endocarditis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on assist control but not on the ARDSnet protocol. There is a concern for respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia or complications from endocarditis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can be caused by sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or viral illness. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible acute renal failure. This could be due to hypotension, vancomycin toxicity, or other factors.
5. Endocarditis: The"

   giving back a little xtra peep but that didn't help, then tried a fent

   tried bolusing 500cc and pt put out more urine (200cc) s effect. I

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of IV drug use, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and endocarditis. He presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, intense left hip pain, and multiple lab abnormalities. He was found to have a large vegetation on the tricuspid valve and is likely experiencing sepsis/endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation. His respiratory status is stable, but there may be a need to wean sedation and consider starting methadone as weaning of fentanyl. He is also experiencing tachycardia, which could be due to hypotension, pain, EtOH withdrawal, opiate withdrawal, anxiety, or hemodynamic instability.

The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to ATN, hypotension, or vancomycin toxicity. Thrombocytopenia is present, and it is unclear if it is new or related to sepsis, DIC, or viral illness. Microcytic anemia is also present, with iron-deficient anemia and elevated ferritin levels. Liver abnormalities include mildly elevated transaminases and direct hyperbilirubinemia, which could be due to intrahepatic cholestasis from sepsis or hepatitis from infection.

The patient's current medications include norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam"

   #sepsis/endocarditis: pt c vegetation on tricuspid valve, lesions in
   lungs, bursiitis in L hip, splenic abscesses, MRSA growing from urine.
   likely all [**1-29**] staph aureus endocarditis [**1-29**] IVDU.  CT surgery does not
   feel patient is an operative candidate. Cardiology  recommends gentle
   diuresis if possible but believe prognosis is poor.
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix to reduce RV load
   -will continue dose vancomycin for goal trough 15-20.
 if elevated
   trough will lower dose but not hold dose
   .
   #Respiratory status/sedation: currently intubated, on assist control
   but not on ardsnet protocol

   # Acute renal failure: likely [**1-29**] poor forward flow with heart failure
   - patient maintains good urine output > 100 cc/hr on own
   - continue gently diuresis and trend Cr

   # Microcytic anemia:
   -iron studies show iron def anemia and elev ferritin in setting of
   acute inflammation, would consider iv iron after pt over acute
   infectious illness
   -hemolysis labs reassuring (LDH elevated, but no sig indir bili,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old individual with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) who is now presenting with fulminant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis and severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The patient also has septic emboli to the lungs and spleen.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 39.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/74 to 125/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Blood cultures have grown MRSA.

The patient is currently intubated and on assist-control ventilation but not on the ARDSnet protocol. There are recommendations for gentle diuresis to reduce right ventricular (RV) load, continuing vancomycin for MRSA endocarditis, and considering weaning off sedation as the patient's respiratory status improves.

The patient has a history of intravenous drug use, which is a risk factor for endocarditis. The presence of MRSA endocarditis with severe TR and septic emboli to the lungs and spleen suggests a poor prognosis. The patient's right heart strain and worsening"

","Summary:
- 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) presenting with fulminant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis and severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR).
- Septic emboli to lungs and spleen.
- TTE shows growing TC vegetation with worsening severe 4+ TR and increased right heart strain.
- Cardiology recommends gentle diuresis if possible but believes prognosis is poor.
- Patient is not a good candidate for cardiac surgery due to septic emboli to lungs and high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
- ID recommends continue Vancomycin at a goal trough of 15-20 mg/dL.
- Patient tried on Nitric Oxide to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance but did not work.
- Weaned off pressors, started on small lasix drip with some improvement in heart rate.
- Given PO narcan for constipation.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) presenting with fulminant MRSA endocarditis and severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). He has septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. The patient's current condition includes fever, respiratory failure, impaired health maintenance, pain control, endocarditis, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/endocarditis: The patient has a vegetation on the tricuspid valve, lesions in the lungs, burritis in the left hip, and splenic abscesses. This indicates a severe bacterial infection that can lead to further complications if not treated promptly.

2. Septic emboli: The septic emboli to the lungs and spleen indicate a risk of organ damage and possible organ failure if not addressed.

3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation but not on ARDSnet protocol. The respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening respiratory failure.

4. Impaired health maintenance: The patient's overall health is compromised due to the severe infection and endocarditis, which may impact his ability to maintain normal bodily functions.

5. Pain control: The patient requires effective pain management due to acute and chronic pain associated with the endocarditis and potential complications.

6. Endocarditis: The patient has bacterial endocarditis, which requires aggressive treatment"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) who is now presenting with fulminant MRSA endocarditis and severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). He has septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. The patient's clinical picture includes fever, respiratory failure, constipation, pain control, impaired health maintenance, and endocarditis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Endocarditis: The patient has vegetations on the tricuspid valve, lesions in the lungs, bursectitis in the left hip, and splenic abscesses. This indicates a severe infection that may lead to further complications such as septic shock or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), especially considering the prolonged intubation time.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Poor forward flow due to heart failure could be contributing to this condition.
4. Microcytic Anemia: The patient has iron-deficiency anemia with elevated ferritin levels in the setting of acute inflammation. This may be related to chronic blood loss or malnutrition.
5. Liver Abnormalities: The patient has mildly elevated transaminases and direct hyper"

   -sputum sent as worsening consolidation on cxr, concerned for VAP
   -social work consulted re both coping for family and re who should be
   making decisions as pt does not have hcp that we know of and has
   children of [**Last Name (un) **] age
   -increased tylenol max great than 2g at nsg request at 9p. Would want
   to discuss this on rounds as pt prob does have underlying liver dis.
   Not sure how to weigh this, prob giving tylenol is best but would want
   to discuss given risks of how fulminent tylenol tox can be.
   -family avail to meet at 2p. they are also flexible about time so if
   another time would be better, please inform. they have one of those
   pagers and hang in the ccu fam room, need to coordinate c family
   members in [**State **] by phone so the earlier a time can be set, the

   -had been mildly concerned about VAP in setting of recurrent fevers
   (the the staph endocarditis and septic emboli are most likely
   etiology). got sputum gram stain which just showed more GPCs which was
   reassuring.
   -pm lytes c hypernatremia unchanged from am, gave 500cc free water and

","The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of IV drug use and is diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, which has led to complications such as septic emboli, splenic abscesses, and tricuspid valve endocarditis. The patient's condition has deteriorated, resulting in acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, and microcytic anemia.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 123/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 6.8 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 27.1%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt of 54, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 32/64), and abnormal kidney function tests (Cr: 1.3, BUN: 38 mg/dL). Imaging studies reveal multifocal areas of alveolar opacification in the right lung, consistent with septic emboli, as well as moderate right pleural effusion.

   -nuwan talked to fam, plan to have telephoone mtg at some point
   tomorrow regarding GOC.
   -sputum sent as worsening consolidation on cxr, concerned for VAP
   -social work consulted re both coping for family and re who should be
   making decisions as pt does not have hcp that we know of and has
   children of [**Last Name (un) **] age
   -increased tylenol max great than 2g at nsg request at 9p. Would want
   to discuss this on rounds as pt prob does have underlying liver dis.
   Not sure how to weigh this, prob giving tylenol is best but would want
   to discuss given risks of how fulminent tylenol tox can be.
   -family avail to meet at 2p. they are also flexible about time so if
   another time would be better, please inform. they have one of those
   pagers and hang in the ccu fam room, need to coordinate c family
   members in [**State **] by phone so the earlier a time can be set, the
   better.
   -had been mildly concerned about VAP in setting of recurrent fevers
   (the the staph endocarditis and septic emboli are most likely
   etiology). got sputum gram stain which just showed more GPCs which was
   reassuring.
   -pm lytes c hypernatremia unchanged from am, gave 500cc free water and
   kept tube feed free water the same (as had just increased that this

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected septic emboli secondary to Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. The patient has a history of intravenous drug use and presents with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and evidence of right-sided heart failure. He was intubated due to respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation for six days. The patient's condition is complicated by several comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for six days, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The sputum gram stain showed 2+ gram-positive cocci in clusters/chains, indicating a possible bacterial infection.
2. Septic emboli: The patient's endocarditis has led to the formation of septic emboli, which can cause further complications such as pulmonary abscesses, splenic abscesses, or other organ damage.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has impaired renal function, and his serum creatinine levels have been rising. This could be due to septic shock, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, or complications from endocarditis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level of 148 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia. This may be related to dehydration or imbalances in fluid"

   153* 49* 7.45 35*
   Imaging: [**9-24**] Echo:  There is a moderate vegetation on the tricuspid
   valve (1.8 cm x 0.7 cm). Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-9-21**], the
   severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased with slightly
   decrease size of the vegetation (previously at 2.1 cm x 1.0 cm). The
   right ventricular size has decrease with improved function.
   Overall left systolic function normal w/ EF of 55%.
   [**9-23**]:  CXR
   FINDINGS: Multifocal areas of alveolar opacification affecting the
   right lung
   to a greater degree than the left appear slightly worse in the interval
   within
   the right lung. Coexisting multifocal cavitary nodules are consistent
   with
   septic emboli. Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. Indwelling
   devices remain in standard position.
   Microbiology: 1) Gram + cocci in sputum, resp culture pending

   Repeated Bcx from [**9-18**] and [**9-19**] show no growth, [**9-23**] is pending
   3) Urine cx from [**9-17**] shows coag+ staph but repeated urine cxs on [**9-18**]
   show no growth
   Assessment and Plan
   57M w hx of IVDU, likely MRSA endocarditis with vegetations on
   tricuspid valve, septic emboli to lungs, spleen, bursitis in hip, MRSA
   in urine; CT surgery does not feel patient is an operative candidate.
   Cardiology recommends gentle diuresis if possible but believe prognosis
   is poor.
   1) endocarditis:  slight improvement in vegetation size and TR by echo
   yesterday, but patient continues to be febrile with rising white count
   to 16.
   - Continue vanc for likely MRSA endocarditis;  slight improvement in
   vegetation size but continues to be febrile
   - holding off on getting MRI given discussion yesterday
   - On lasix ttg 8 mg/hr:  goal is -1L daily; currently is -4 L; was on
   and off/pressors o/n so can consider slowing lasix gtt.
   -appreciate cards, ID, surgery recs
   .
   2) Respiratory status/sedation: currently intubated
   -Was switched from pressure support to CMV/ASSIST
   -maintain on sedation
   .
   3) persistent fevers: Has had continued fevers, also rise in WBC from
   9-> 16 in last 24 hours.
   Most likely this is [**1-29**] pulmonary abscesses, endocarditis and splenic
   abscesses. Could also have VAP given prolonged intubation.  Could
   consider reculturing blood + urine+sputum; can repeat CXR but would not
   escalate care given pending CMO status.
   .
   4) Tachycardia/ Worsening valve func: HRs continue to be 110 - 130.
   -Likely due to underlying sepsis.
   .
   5)  Acute renal failure: likely [**1-29**] poor forward flow with heart
   failure
   -Resolving, continue to monitor
   .
   6) Microcytic anemia:
   -Anemia of chronic disease, iron def anemia; no hemolysis; keep active
   T+S
   .
   7) Mild transaminitis:  likely from GB sludge, related to sepsis
   Liver abnormalities: Mildly elevated transaminases along with direct
   hyperbilirubinemia. RUQ US showed GB sludge.  Potentially from
   intrahepatic cholestasis from sepsis, hepatitis from infection.
   -hep c antibody positive. HCV PCR negative!
   -hep b core and surface antibody pos, c/w prior infection. pt should
   not get steroids unless absolutely necessary (and in that case may need
   ppx)

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) who is likely suffering from MRSA endocarditis with vegetations on the tricuspid valve, septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and bursitis in the hip. The patient also has MRSA in his urine. The cardiology team does not believe the patient is an operative candidate for cardiac surgery. The patient's prognosis is described as poor.

Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has shown slight improvement in vegetation size and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) on echocardiogram (Echo) yesterday, but continues to have a fever and rising white blood cell count.
- Continue vancomycin for likely MRSA endocarditis.
- Slight improvement in vegetation size but continues to be febrile.

2. Respiratory status/sedation: The patient is currently intubated and switched from pressure support to CMV/ASSIST.
- Maintain on sedation.

3. Persistent fevers: The patient has had continued fevers, along with a rise in white blood cell count from 9 to 16 in the last 24 hours.
- This could be due to pulmonary abscesses, endocarditis, and splenic abscesses. It could also be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the prolonged intubation. Consider reculturing blood, urine, and sput"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) who is likely suffering from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis. The patient has vegetations on the tricuspid valve, which have caused septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and bursitis in the hip. The patient also has MRSA in his urine. Cardiology does not believe the patient is an operative candidate for cardiac surgery. The patient's respiratory status is currently being managed with intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has persistent fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting ongoing infection. There are concerns about possible pulmonary abscesses, endocarditis, and splenic abscesses. The patient's tachycardia may be due to underlying sepsis. The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is likely due to poor forward flow with heart failure. The patient has microcytic anemia, which is likely due to anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia. There is mild transaminitis, likely from gallbladder sludge or intrahepatic cholestasis from sepsis. The patient's liver tests show mildly elevated transaminases and direct hyperbilirubinemia. Hepatitis C antibodies are positive, but hepatitis C PCR is negative. Hepatitis B core and surface antibodies are positive, indicating a prior infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU), presenting with likely MRSA endocarditis. The patient has vegetations on the tricuspid valve, which have led to septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and bursitis in the hip. The patient also has MRSA in his urine. The patient is currently in the ICU and is intubated.

Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has shown some improvement over the last 12 hours, with reduced fever and a decreasing white blood cell count. Mental status has also improved, with the patient opening his eyes to verbal cues and slightly moving his head on command. The patient will continue receiving vancomycin for MRSA endocarditis.
2. Respiratory status/sedation: The patient is currently intubated and on CMV/ASSIST ventilation mode. Sedation will be maintained with midazolam and fentanyl.
3. Alk phos elevation: The patient's alkaline phosphatase level has increased from 78 on 9/19 to 198 this morning, and further to 212. AST and ALT levels have also trended up. This could be secondary to intrahepatic or posthepatic cholestasis in the setting of sepsis or acalculous cholecystitis. An RUQ US will be repeated to assess for biliary sludge and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) who is likely suffering from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis. Vegetations on the tricuspid valve have led to septic emboli in the lungs, spleen, and bursitis in the hip. The patient also has MRSA in his urine. Cardiothoracic surgery does not believe the patient is an operative candidate due to poor prognosis.

The patient's clinical condition has shown some improvement over the last 12 hours. He is afebrile for the longest duration in several days, his white blood cell count has improved from 16 to 8, and his mental status has improved. He is now consistently opening his eyes to verbal cues and can slightly move his head on command.

The plan of care includes continuing vancomycin for the likely MRSA endocarditis, as there has been a slight improvement in vegetation size and clinical improvement. The patient is on lasix titrated to goal of -1L daily, currently at -4L. This may be slowed down due to the patient being on and off pressors overnight. The patient's respiratory status is being supported with CMV/ASSIST, and he will continue on midazolam and fentanyl for sedation.

There is an elevation in alkaline phosphatase (alk phos), as well as trends"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M w hx of IVDU, likely MRSA endocarditis with vegetations on
   tricuspid valve, septic emboli to lungs, spleen, bursitis in hip, MRSA
   in urine; CT surgery does not feel patient is an operative candidate.
   Cardiology recommends gentle diuresis if possible but believe prognosis
   is poor.
   1) endocarditis: Still continues to be febrile but leukocytosis has
   resolved with slight improvement in vegetation size on last echo.
   -Continue vancomycin
   -F/u repeat blood cxs -> sent for fungal, AFB
   -F/u repeat CXR
   -? MRI:  Might help family in decision making process; results of
   conference call?
   .
   2) Respiratory status/sedation: currently intubated
   -On CMV/ASSIST
   -increased midazolam and fentanyl for sedation given patient discomfort
   .
   3) Anemia: HCT has been trending down 23-> 19.  Got 1 Unit of blood
   this AM.  Repeat HCT this PM.  MCV is 77 suggesting microcytic, iron
   stores are low; however TIBC is also low and ferritin is high
   suggesting probably mixed iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic
   disease.
   -Repeat HCT this PM; if HCT < 20 tranfuse another 2 units
   -Fe studies [**Location (un) 8513**] Fe ~ 10, start iron supplementation
   .
   4) Hypernatremia:  Sodium rose to 148
   -Run 500 ccs of free water
   4) Alk phos elevation: Continue to trend; could be secondary to hepatic
   congestion, biliary sludge, stones.  Doesn't seem actively obstructed
   given normal total bilirubin.  Continue to follow.
   .
   4)   Tachycardia:  HRs 110s - 120s; has been a chronic issue, likely
   physiological response to continued fevers.
   .
   5) Mild Hypotension - BPs this AM at 95/55.  BPs have been stable over
   the past 24 hours at 105 - 120s systolic; has been off pressors
   overnight.  Unclear as to the etiology.    No recent changes in
   sedation or in ventilator settings.    Possible its secondary to
   improvement in clinical status, resolution of fevers;
   -Fluid bolus of 500 cc NS this AM
   .
   6) #FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, OGT, tube feeds
   .
   9) Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, lactulose, senna, colace
   .
    10) Access: IJ and axillary aline, holding off on PICC
   .
   11) Code: DNR;  ready to make CMO, awaiting approval from brother in
   [**Name2 (NI) **] and estranged children (daughter [**Name (NI) 8465**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8467**])

He has developed septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and bursitis in the hip, as well as MRSA in the urine. The cardiology team does not believe the patient is an operative candidate for surgery.

The patient continues to be febrile but has shown improvement in vegetation size on the last echocardiogram. The plan is to continue vancomycin and follow up with repeat blood cultures (sent for fungal and acid-fast bacilli), repeat chest X-ray, and possibly an MRI to help with the decision-making process for the family.

The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and he is currently intubated on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV)/assist mode. Sedation has been increased due to patient discomfort and thick secretions. 

The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 19.6 g/dL, and he received one unit of blood transfusion. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 77, indicating microcytic anemia. Iron studies suggest mixed iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease.

   tricuspid valve, septic emboli to lungs, spleen, bursitis in hip, MRSA
   in urine; CT surgery does not feel patient is an operative candidate.
   Cardiology recommends gentle diuresis if possible but believe prognosis
   is poor.
   1) endocarditis: Still continues to be febrile but leukocytosis has
   resolved with slight improvement in vegetation size on last echo.
   -Vanc trough in AM is 15:  increasing vanc dosing to 1 gm q12 IV
   -F/u repeat blood cxs -> sent for fungal, AFB
   -F/u repeat CXR
   -MRI ordered;
   .
   2) Respiratory status/sedation: currently intubated
   -Switch from assist to pressure support
   -increased midazolam and fentanyl for sedation given patient discomfort
   .
   3) Anemia: HCT has been trending down 23-> 19.  Got 1 Unit of blood
   this AM.  Repeat HCT this PM.  MCV is 77 suggesting microcytic, iron
   stores are low; however TIBC is also low and ferritin is high
   suggesting probably mixed iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic
   disease.
   -Repeat HCT this PM; if HCT < 20 tranfuse another 2 units
   -Fe studies are low but ferritin too high to be a co-existing iron
   deficiency with an anemia of chronic disease; would hold on iron
   supplementation for now
   .
   4) Hypernatremia:  Sodium rose to 148
   -Increase free water flushes 200q4 -> 250 q3.
   4) Alk phos elevation: Continue to trend; could be secondary to hepatic
   congestion, biliary sludge, stones.  Doesn't seem actively obstructed
   given normal total bilirubin.  Continue to follow.
   .
   4)   Tachycardia:  HRs 110s - 120s; has been a chronic issue, likely
   physiological response to continued fevers.
   .
   5) Mild Hypotension - BPs this AM at 95/55.  BPs have been stable over
   the past 24 hours at 105 - 120s systolic; has been off pressors
   overnight.  Unclear as to the etiology.    No recent changes in
   sedation or in ventilator settings.    Possible its secondary to
   improvement in clinical status, resolution of fevers;
   -Fluid bolus of 500 cc NS this AM
   .
   6) #FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, OGT, tube feeds
   .
   9) Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, lactulose, senna, colace
   .
    10) Access: IJ and axillary aline, getting a power PICC
   -d/c axillary A-line
   .
   11) Code: DNR;  ready to make CMO, awaiting approval from brother in

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) who is likely suffering from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis with vegetations on the tricuspid valve, leading to septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and bursitis in the hip. MRSA has also been identified in the urine. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is not considered an operative candidate by cardiac surgery. The prognosis is believed to be poor.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1) Endocarditis: The patient is still febrile but has shown improvement in vegetation size on the last echocardiogram. Vancomycin trough levels are being monitored, and the dosage is being increased to 1 gm every 12 hours intravenously. Repeat blood cultures have been sent for fungal and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) testing. A follow-up chest X-ray (CXR) has also been ordered, along with an MRI.

2) Respiratory status/sedation: The patient is currently intubated and on pressure support. Midazolam and fentanyl sedation have been increased due to patient discomfort.

3) Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has been trending down from 23 to 19. One unit of blood was transfused this morning,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) and suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis. He has vegetations on the tricuspid valve, septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and bursitis in the hip. The patient also has MRSA in his urine. The cardiologist does not believe the patient is an operative candidate for cardiac surgery. The patient continues to be febrile but has shown improvement in vegetation size on the last echocardiogram. 

Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's condition is still ongoing, indicated by ongoing fevers and leukocytosis. However, there has been a slight improvement in vegetation size on the last echo. The plan includes increasing vancomycin dosing, repeating blood cultures, and sending them for fungal and acid-fast bacilli testing. An MRI has also been ordered.
2. Respiratory status/sedation: The patient's ABG results show low oxygen levels (pO2 44), elevated carbon dioxide levels (pCO2 55), and a near-normal pH level (7.36) on spontaneous breathing. The patient is currently on pressure support, and repeat gases are planned today. The patient's RIsB is adequate, and spontaneous breathing trials are being considered. The PEEP is being weaned down.

   in urine; CT surgery does not feel patient is an operative candidate.
   1) endocarditis: Still continues to be febrile but leukocytosis has
   resolved with slight improvement in vegetation size on last echo.
   -Vanc trough in AM is 28:  consider decreasing vanc dosing ot 750mg

   3) Anemia: HCT has been trending down slowly over the course of the
   admission.  Anemia is microcytic.  Iron studies suggest mixed iron def
   anemia and anemia of chronic disease.
   -Guiaic all stools
   -Fe studies are low but ferritin too high to be a co-existing iron
   deficiency with an anemia of chronic disease; would hold on iron
   supplementation for now

 pain is with some movements, particularly with passive
   hip flexion, but not consistent.  Internal and external rotation
   without difficulty, no tenderness to palpation.
   - joint infection unlikely.

   -Increase free water flushes 200q4 -> 250 q3.
   -Nutrition following; they recommended watching how he does on free
   water flushes.  Na this AM is 145.  Continue flushes.
   4) Alk phos elevation: Continue to trend; could be secondary to hepatic
   congestion, biliary sludge, stones.  Doesn't seem actively obstructed
   given normal total bilirubin.  Continue to follow.
   5)   Tachycardia:  HRs 110s - 120s; has been a chronic issue, likely

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) who is likely suffering from MRSA endocarditis with vegetations on the tricuspid valve, septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, bursitis in the hip, and MRSA in the urine. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's condition suggests likely MRSA endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves. Vegetations on the tricuspid valve may lead to septic emboli to other organs such as the lungs, spleen, or bursitis in the hip. The patient's fever and leukocytosis have resolved, but improvement in vegetation size on the last echo indicates ongoing endocarditis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy with vancomycin is being administered.

2. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient was previously intubated and mechanically ventilated, but has now been extubated. The presence of bilateral rales on lung examination suggests ongoing respiratory issues. Continuous monitoring and oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula are being provided.

3. Impaired health maintenance: The patient's overall health maintenance seems to be compromised due to chronic conditions and recent infections. This can lead to further complications if not addressed appropriately.

4. Pain control:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) and likely MRSA endocarditis with vegetations on the tricuspid valve. The patient has septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and bursitis in the hip. MRSA infection is also present in the urine. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been febrile but leukocytosis has resolved with slight improvement in vegetation size on the last echo. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient still continues to be febrile, but there is an improvement in vegetation size on the last echo. The patient's MRSA endocarditis with vegetations on the tricuspid valve needs to be closely monitored for any signs of complications such as septic emboli or heart failure.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture is positive for pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be initiated to treat the infection and prevent further complications.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and extubation has been attempted. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

4. Anemia: The patient's HCT has been trending down slowly over the course of the admission. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the anemia and appropriate management.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with tricuspid valve MRSA endocarditis and septic emboli. The patient's recent events include being extubated since yesterday, negative fluid balance, and changes in antibiotic treatment. The patient has a history of fatigue, dry mouth, cough, joint pain in the left hip, and anemia. Vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications for pain management, prophylaxis, and nutrition support. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's weak cough and minimal gag reflex, along with positive MRSA sputum, suggest a high risk for respiratory failure due to septic emboli in the setting of TV endocarditis.
2. Septic Joint: Considering the patient's left hip pain and bacteremia, there is a possibility of a septic joint, which may require evaluation and treatment by orthopedics.
3. Constipation: The patient's use of lactulose for pain control increases the risk of constipation, which needs to be monitored and managed accordingly.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels may be attributed to the OG tube being out with ETT, necessitating replacement of the NGT and monitoring of electrolytes and free water"

   - consider repeat echo for evaluation of interval improvement from [**9-24**]
   # MRSA Pneumonia: secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
   Patient now extubated with good saturations on room air.
   - continue vancomycin 750 mg q12
   # Anemia: patient has demonstrated episodes throughout admission when
   HCT has trended down.  Labs suggest this is multifactorial as
   microcytic picture with elevated ferritin (possibly acute phase
   reactant)
   - continue to trend with daily HCT
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Na levels stable this AM at 144.  Nutrition is
   following and recommend continued free water flushes for now.
   - continue free water flushes (150 q4) with tube feeds PRN
   # LFT
s:  Aminases remain slightly elevated but stable since admission
   while AP continues to trend up in the setting of a normal and stable
   BR.  This may be secondary to hepatic congestion from severe TR,
   possible septic emboli to liver, or non-hepatic source of AP (bone).
   Obstructive picture is not convincing as BR remains normal.
   - continue to trend with QOD AP
   - consider repeat abdominal imaging
   - consider GGT to distinguish hepatic and non-hepatic source
   #  Tachycardia:  continue sinus tachycardia evaluated my cardiology.
   This likely represents a physiologic response to fever and compensation

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) related endocarditis and lupus, now presenting with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and possibly the brain. The patient was extubated, had a fever spike, and experienced fluid loss. The MRI showed mild signal enhancement at C6-7, which should be further evaluated. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 125/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has decreased from 66 kg to 59.6 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 800 mL and output of 424 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,453 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including vancomycin, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. 

Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has MRSA endocarditis with ongoing intermittent fever spikes, indicating ongoing infection. Vegetation size has shown improvement based on the last echocardiogram. Vancomycin therapy should be continued, and repeat echocardiogram should be considered for further evaluation.
2. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient developed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use and lupus, currently presenting with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and possibly the brain. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. 

24-hour events include the patient being extubated, spiking a fever, and experiencing a significant drop in urine output. An MRI was performed, showing mild signal enhancement at C6-7, which may require further evaluation. The patient is receiving vancomycin for MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, as well as heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 110-130 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/83-147/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is responsive and able to follow commands. 

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 131 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypernatremia. Blood cultures are pending, while catheter and fungal blood cultures"

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently extubated with good oxygen saturations on room air. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has MRSA endocarditis, which can lead to complications such as septic emboli, heart failure, or worsening of TR.
2. Septic Emboli: The patient has already developed septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and possibly the brain. These emboli can cause pneumonia, splenic abscess, or cerebral abscesses.
3. TR: Severe TR can lead to right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
4. Anemia: The patient has episodes of anemia throughout admission, which may be multifactorial. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which may require management with free water flushes.
6. Liver Function Test (LFT) abnormalities: The patient has elevated aminases and alkaline phosphatase (AP), which may be due to hepatic congestion from severe TR, septic emboli to the liver, or"

 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Continues febrile. Last cultured yesterday. No growth to date.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Septic emboli in setting
   of TV endocarditis, sputum positive for MRSA. Continues extubated.
   Voice weak and weak cough, minimal gag.  Unable to get out of bed given
   diffuse weakness.  Nonfocal neuro exam so will hold off on MRI for now
   and follow exam.   PT consult.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  Denies pain this morning.

 LEFT HIP PAIN:  Had been attributed to bursitis. With bactermia also
   need to consider septic joint.  Ortho to consult.  Consider lidocaine
   patch.

 CONSTIPATION:  Lactulose.

 HYPERNATREMIA:  Unable to replace NGT yesterday.  Monitor
   electrolytes and free water deficit for need for further free water
   replacement via IV.

 NUTRITION:  Remains a leading issues.  Patient with weak gag/cough,
   unclear if he would be able to eat on his own.  Speech and swallow
   evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with tricuspid endocarditis. The patient's chief complaint is fever, and they have been experiencing autodiuresis and increased alertness. The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently being treated with vancomycin for MRSA. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated temperature, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate slightly elevated, and SpO2 at 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 66 kg at admission to 59.6 kg currently. There is a fluid balance of -2453 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted above.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin appearance, normal-sized heart with a systolic murmur, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination could not be assessed due to the patient's condition. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

   # Endocarditis: continued intermittent fever spikes but improvement in
   vegetation size demonstrated by last echo. HR and RR increase with
   fevers.
   - continue vancomycin 750 mg q12, qod vanco troughs
   - treat fevers with Tylenol
   # MRSA Pneumonia: secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
   Patient now extubated, requiring some oxygen per nasal cannula
   - continue vancomycin 750 mg q12
   - suction secretions
   - repeat sputum cx
   # Weakness: Likely myopathy from prolonged ICU course and serious
   illness. Improving slightly, able to move slightly WITH gravity. Also
   with trouble projecting voice.
   - ENT c/s today
   - consider neuro c/s if no improvement
   # Anemia: patient has demonstrated episodes throughout admission when
   HCT has trended down.  Labs suggest this is multifactorial as
   microcytic picture with elevated ferritin (possibly acute phase
   reactant)
   - continue to trend with daily HCT
   # Hypernatremia:  Na levels up to 148 today.  Nutrition is following
   and recommend continued free water flushes.
   - continue free water flushes (200 q4) with tube feeds, may need to
   increase based on am labs
   # LFT
s:  Aminases remain slightly elevated but stable since admission
   while AP continues to trend up in the setting of a normal and stable
   BR.  This may be secondary to hepatic congestion from severe TR,
   possible septic emboli to liver, or non-hepatic source of AP (bone).
   Obstructive picture is not convincing as BR remains normal.  Elevated
   GGT indicated hepatic source.
   - continue to trend with QOD AP
   - consider repeat abdominal imaging
   #  Tachycardia:  This likely represents a physiologic response to fever
   and compensation for severe TR.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, leading to septic emboli in the lungs and spleen. The patient has persistent fevers, severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and profound weakness. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Infective Endocarditis: The patient has MRSA endocarditis, which increases the risk of further infection spread throughout the body. Complications may include septic emboli, heart valve damage, or systemic infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: Due to septic emboli to the lungs, the patient's respiratory function may be compromised, leading to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

3. Septic Shock: With persistent fevers and bacteremia, there is a risk of developing septic shock, characterized by low blood pressure, inadequate tissue perfusion, and organ dysfunction.

4. Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR): Severe TR can lead to heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath, edema, and fatigue.

5. Myopathy: The patient's prolonged ICU course and serious illness may contribute to muscle weakness or myopathy.

6. Anemia: The patient has episodes of declining hematocrit levels, indicating possible anemia. This could be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or other underlying causes.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia who is currently in the ICU. The patient has had several significant events over the past 24 hours. He pulled out his nasogastric tube (NGT) and aspirated gastric contents, leading to potential aspiration pneumonia. A chest X-ray was performed, but the results are not mentioned in the note. The patient is still experiencing intermittent fever spikes, indicating ongoing infection. He has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and profound weakness, likely due to his prolonged ICU stay and serious illness.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 bpm and a temperature of 38.6°C. His blood pressure is within normal range, and he has an increased respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation remains at 100% with the use of a nasal cannula. The patient's weight has decreased from 56.3 kg at admission to 52 kg currently.

Fluid balance reveals a net loss of 519 mL and 585 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been given a total of 1,081 mL of fluids, including 500 mL of normal saline and 175 mL of lactated Ringer's. The patient's intake includes 581 mL of tube feeds through the NGT. Blood product transfusions totaling"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M w/ MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia with septic emboli to lungs,
   spleen with persistent fevers, severe TR and profound weakness.
   # Endocarditis: continued intermittent fever spikes but improvement in
   vegetation size demonstrated by last echo. HR and RR increase with
   fevers.
   - continue vancomycin 750 mg q12, qod vanco troughs
   - treat fevers with Tylenol
   - get MRI
   # MRSA Pneumonia: secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
   Patient now extubated, requiring some oxygen per nasal cannula
   - continue vancomycin 750 mg q12
   - suction secretions
   - repeat sputum cx
   # Weakness: Likely myopathy from prolonged ICU course and serious
   illness. Improving slightly, able to move slightly WITH gravity. Also
   with trouble projecting voice.
   - F/u ENT recs
   - consider neuro c/s if no improvement
   # Anemia: patient has demonstrated episodes throughout admission when
   HCT has trended down.  Labs suggest this is multifactorial as
   microcytic picture with elevated ferritin (possibly acute phase
   reactant)
   - continue to trend with daily HCT
   # Hypernatremia:  Na levels up to 148 today.  Nutrition is following
   and recommend continued free water flushes.
   - Given that NG tube pulled, give 500 ccs of D5W today
   - if NG tube gets replaced, then restart free water flushes 200 q4
   # LFT
s:  Aminases remain slightly elevated but stable since admission
   while AP continues to trend up in the setting of a normal and stable
   BR.  This may be secondary to hepatic congestion from severe TR,
   possible septic emboli to liver, or non-hepatic source of AP (bone).
   Obstructive picture is not convincing as BR remains normal.  Elevated
   GGT indicated hepatic source.
   - continue to trend with QOD AP
   - repeat RUQ
   #  Tachycardia:  This likely represents a physiologic response to fever
   and compensation for severe TR.
   # FEN: speech and swallow - unable to take po safely: needs replacement
   of post-pyloric NG tube and start tubefeeds with free water. Replete
   lytes
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, SQH, bowel regimen, PPI

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, presenting with septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. He has persistent fevers, severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and profound weakness. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102.8°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 119/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is extubated but still requires some oxygen.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and platelet count. The creatinine level has increased from 0.9 to 1.2 mg/dL. Other lab values such as potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal ranges. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated PT/INR of 14.5 and PTT of 27.7.

The patient's physical examination reveals sinus tachycardia and not assessed findings for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments. The patient's recent imaging includes a chest X-ray on [**2131-10-2**] showing XXX.

The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin 750 mg q12, treating fevers with Tylenol, obtaining an MRI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia with septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and liver. He has persistent fevers, severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and profound weakness. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute pain, impaired health maintenance, and pain control. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin for MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia. He has been experiencing intermittent fever spikes but has shown improvement in vegetation size on the last echocardiogram. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. There are also multiple abscesses in the lungs and spleen. The patient is extubated and requires some oxygen via a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: Given the patient's history of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis, there is a risk of developing septic shock due to the ongoing infection.
2. Organ dysfunction: The presence of septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and liver may lead to organ dysfunction, potentially affecting respiratory function, hematological parameters, and hepatic function.
3. Endocarditis-related complications: The patient may be at risk for further complications related to endocarditis, such as heart valve damage or embolic events.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if the lung abs"

   fevers.
   - continue vancomycin 1250 mg qday, daily vanco troughs with  new
   dosing.
   - treat fevers with Tylenol
   #Fevers, increasing white count - endocarditis is the main suspect
   causing fevers.  However, in light of new finding of abdominal U/S
   Splenic abscess possible, particularly given known septic emboli to the
   spleen.  Continue workup of new or hospital acquired infections.
   - d/w IR if cyst drainage is possible.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a diagnosis of MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, resulting in septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. The patient also has a history of respiratory failure, impaired health maintenance, pain control, endocarditis, fever, and constipation.

The patient's current condition includes intermittent fever spikes, improvement in vegetation size demonstrated by the last echo, severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and profound weakness. The patient is being treated with vancomycin 1250 mg qday, with daily vanco troughs, and Tylenol to manage fevers.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition:

1. Splenic abscess: The patient has new findings on abdominal ultrasound showing lesions in the spleen, including a large 3.9 cm solid and cystic lesion. This raises the possibility of a splenic abscess, especially given the known septic emboli to the spleen.

2. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has secondary MRSA pneumonia due to septic emboli from endocarditis. The patient is extubated but requires some oxygen through a nasal cannula. Treatment with vancomycin is ongoing, and further sputum cultures will be repeated.

3. Weakness: The patient likely has myopathy from prolonged ICU stay and serious illness. There is slight improvement in mobility, but the patient"

   respiratory status to room air breathing, has had slow to improve
   weakness and has had persistent issue of capacity to tolerate po
   intake.  He has had persistent fever, tachycardia and tachypnea but
   without evidence of clear source.
   1)Sepsis/Endocarditis-Persistent and intermittent fevers, some decrease
   in vegetation size
   -Vancomycin to continue
   -Will need continued chronic support with antibiotics
   -Will continue to treat for pulmonary infection with ABX and chest PT
   as needed
   2)Weakness--Likely critical illness polyneuropathy
the concern is that
   he has inability to maintain safe po intake and will need a feeding
   tube for access
be it G-tube or NGT.
   -Continue PT
   -Will replace feeding tube
   -Will need to continue with chest PT and suctioning

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of endocarditis. He has been admitted to the ICU and has shown some improvement in respiratory status, now breathing on room air. However, he still has persistent issues with weakness and intolerance to oral intake. The patient continues to have intermittent fevers and tachycardia, but no clear source of infection has been identified. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Endocarditis: The patient's persistent fevers and ongoing endocarditis despite antibiotic treatment indicate a potential complication of sepsis. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
2. Weakness: The patient's inability to maintain safe oral intake suggests critical illness polyneuropathy. This condition requires continued physical therapy and the consideration of alternative feeding methods, such as a gastrostomy tube or nasogastric tube.
3. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, there is still a risk of acute respiratory failure, particularly if the pulmonary infection worsens or if the patient develops other complications.
4. Constipation: The patient's current issue with constipation may become more problematic if he requires a feeding tube, as this can often lead to decreased bowel motility.
5. Shock: The patient's persistent tachyc"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a diagnosis of MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia with septic emboli to the lungs, spleen, and possible splenic abscess. The patient's current health progress includes persistent fevers, severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), profound weakness, and difficulty speaking and projecting voice.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock: Due to the presence of septic emboli and ongoing fevers, there is a risk of septic shock, which can lead to hypotension, organ failure, and even death if not promptly treated.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure, secondary to MRSA pneumonia and septic emboli, may worsen if the infection spreads or if the patient develops further lung complications.

3. Splenic Abscess: The recent finding of abdominal ultrasound suggesting a splenic abscess indicates a potential localized infection in the spleen. If this abscess ruptures or becomes more severe, it can lead to systemic infection and further complications.

4. Endocarditis-related Complications: As the patient has MRSA endocarditis, there is a risk of endocarditis-related complications such as heart valve damage, heart failure, or embolic events.

5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's worsening renal function, as indicated by increasing serum creatinine levels, may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) if"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, who has septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. He continues to have intermittent fever spikes despite improvement in vegetation size demonstrated by the last echo. His heart rate and respiratory rate increase with fevers. He is being treated with vancomycin 1250 mg qday, with daily vanco troughs for dosing. He also receives Tylenol for fever management.

The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and endocarditis is the main suspect causing the fevers. However, a new finding of an abdominal ultrasound showing a splenic abscess is possible, especially given known septic emboli to the spleen. A workup for new or hospital-acquired infections is being continued as appropriate.

The patient has MRSA pneumonia secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis. He has been extubated and requires some oxygen via a nasal cannula. Vancomycin is continued, and he is being suctioned to clear secretions. Follow-up sputum cultures are also planned.

The patient's weakness is likely due to myopathy from a prolonged ICU course and serious illness. He is improving slightly, able to move against gravity if encouraged, but has trouble projecting his voice. Physical therapy is being provided, including daily PT and outpatient PT to help him out of bed to a chair.

The patient is unable to speak, and ENT"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of infective endocarditis and critical illness polyneuropathy. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results are documented in the note. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued infection and sepsis due to endocarditis, which may lead to organ failure.
2. Progression of critical illness polyneuropathy, which can result in worsening weakness and possible respiratory failure.
3. Malnutrition due to refusal of enteral access, leading to further weakness and poor recovery.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheter use.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Abscess formation and potential need for splenectomy.
7. Renal dysfunction indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
8. Hepatic dysfunction indicated by elevated liver enzymes.
9. Potential electrolyte imbalances due to ongoing losses and medications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and implement appropriate interventions to prevent these potential complications."

   fevers.
   - continue vancomycin 1250 mg qday, daily vanco troughs with  new
   dosing.
   - treat fevers with Tylenol
   #Fevers, increasing white count - endocarditis is the main suspect
   causing fevers.  However, in light of new finding of abdominal U/S
   Splenic abscess possible, particularly given known septic emboli to the
   spleen.  Continue workup of new or hospital acquired infections as
   appropriate.
   - discussed with surgery, advised that splenectomy would not be
   beneficial
   - rpt sputum and urine cultures
   # MRSA Pneumonia: secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
   Patient now extubated, requiring oxygen per nasal cannula
   - continue vancomycin

   # Weakness: Likely myopathy from prolonged ICU course and serious
   illness. Improving slightly, able to move against gravity if
   encouraged.  Also with trouble projecting voice.  Has been working with
   PT to get out of bed to chair.
   - daily PT, outpt PT
   #inability to speak - ENT has seen his vocal cords and noted no
   physical abnormalities.  Likely due to weakness as above, and excess
   secretions.   Pt seems frustrated by this, and has become agitated at
   times.
   - c/s social work
   # Anemia: patient has demonstrated episodes throughout admission when
   HCT has trended down.  Labs suggest this is multifactorial as
   microcytic picture with elevated ferritin (possibly acute phase
   reactant)
   - continue to trend with daily HCT

   57M w/ MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia with septic emboli to lungs,
   spleen with persistent fevers, severe TR and profound weakness.
   # Endocarditis: continued intermittent fever spikes but improvement in
   vegetation size demonstrated by last echo. HR and RR increase with
   fevers.
   - continue vancomycin
 1250 yesterday, today
s trough (2 hours before
   dose) was 14.8.  Increase vancomycin to 1500 today.
   - treat fevers with Tylenol
   #Fevers, increasing white count - endocarditis is the main suspect
   causing fevers.  However, in light of new finding of abdominal U/S
   Splenic abscess possible, particularly given known septic emboli to the
   spleen.  Continue workup of new or hospital acquired infections as
   appropriate.
   - discussed with surgery, advised that splenectomy would not be
   beneficial.
   - rpt sputum and urine cultures.
   -continue to follow pending cultures.
   # MRSA Pneumonia: secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
   Patient now extubated, no longer needed oxygen.
   - continue vancomycin
   - suction secretions
   - f/u sputum cx
   # Weakness: Likely myopathy from prolonged ICU course and serious
   illness. Continues to improve today
 still weak, but better, and able
   to speak softly but clearly.  Has been working with PT to get out of
   bed to chair.
   - daily PT, outpt PT
   # Anemia: patient has demonstrated episodes throughout admission when
   HCT has trended down.  Labs suggest this is multifactorial as
   microcytic picture with elevated ferritin (possibly acute phase
   reactant)
   - continue to trend with daily HCT
 today 25.4 from 27.7 yesterday.
   Will continue to follow closely.
   # Renal function -   increase in creatinine two days ago, now improved
   to 1.1.
   - started maintenance fluids at 75 cc/hr D5W, increased to 100/hr.
   Fluids were held this morning when labs came back with low sodium and
   high glucose.  However, repeat chem 7 showed sodium 146, normal
   glucose.  D5W was restarted.
   # Hypernatremia:  Sodium levels decreased but still above normal.
   Continue D5W maintenance today.
   #L hip pain - bursitis.  No pain with joint examination except direct
   palpation.
   - Continue analgesics.  Lidocaine patch, tylenol.
   # LFT
s:  Aminases remain slightly elevated but stable since admission
   while AP continues to trend up in the setting of a normal and stable
   BR.  This may be secondary to hepatic congestion from severe TR,
   possible septic emboli to liver, or non-hepatic source of AP (bone).
   Obstructive picture is not convincing as BR remains normal.  Elevated
   GGT indicated hepatic source.
   - RUQ US c/w cholelithiasis
   #  Tachycardia:  This likely represents a physiologic response to fever
   and compensation for severe TR.
   # FEN: Has been unable to pass speech and swallow to this point,
   although he is overall improved today, has tolerated ice chips.
   Absolutely refuses NG tube and PEG tube.  Will attempt to re-evaluate
   speech/swallow, advance diet as possible.

   57M w/ MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia with septic emboli to lungs,

   # Endocarditis: continued intermittent fever spikes but improvement in
   vegetation size demonstrated by last echo. HR and RR increase with
   fevers.
   - continue vancomycin
 1500 given yesterday.   Vanco level 24, but
   drawn early.
   - treat fevers with Tylenol
   #Fevers, increasing white count - endocarditis is the main suspect
   causing fevers.  However, in light of new finding of abdominal U/S
   Splenic abscess possible, particularly given known septic emboli to the
   spleen.  Continue workup of new or hospital acquired infections as
   appropriate.   White count normal today.
   - discussed with surgery, advised that splenectomy would not be
   beneficial.
   - rpt sputum and urine cultures.
   -continue to follow pending cultures.
   # MRSA Pneumonia: secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
   Patient now extubated, no longer needed oxygen.
   - continue vancomycin
   - suction secretions
   - f/u sputum cx
   # Weakness: Likely myopathy from prolonged ICU course and serious
   illness. Continues to improve today
 still weak, but better, and able
   to speak softly but clearly.  Has been working with PT to get out of
   bed to chair.
   - daily PT, outpt PT
   # Anemia: patient has demonstrated episodes throughout admission when
   HCT has trended down.  Labs suggest this is multifactorial as
   microcytic picture with elevated ferritin (possibly acute phase
   reactant)
   - continue to trend with daily HCT
 stable today.
   # Renal function -   remains stable, creatinine 1.0 today.
   - D5W maintenance yesterday with good resolution of hypernatremia.  Now
   with increased blood glucose.  Will hold D5W for now.
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved as above.
   #L hip pain - bursitis.  No pain with joint examination except direct
   palpation.
   - Continue analgesics.  Lidocaine patch, tylenol.
   # LFT
s:  Aminases remain slightly elevated but stable since admission
   while AP continues to trend up in the setting of a normal and stable
   BR.  This may be secondary to hepatic congestion from severe TR,
   possible septic emboli to liver, or non-hepatic source of AP (bone).
   Obstructive picture is not convincing as BR remains normal.  Elevated
   GGT indicated hepatic source.
   - RUQ US c/w cholelithiasis
   #  Tachycardia:  Stable - This likely represents a physiologic response
   to fever and compensation for severe TR.

   although he is overall improved today, has tolerated ice chips.
   Absolutely refuses NG tube and PEG tube.  Will attempt to re-evaluate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, who has developed septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. He presents with persistent fevers, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and profound weakness. The patient has been in the ICU and has received treatment with vancomycin and other medications. He has shown improvement in vegetation size on echocardiogram and has tolerated applesauce. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his white blood cell count is normal. However, he still experiences intermittent fever spikes, and there are concerns about possible abdominal abscesses. The patient's renal function remains stable, and his sodium levels have resolved. He also has anemia, hypernatremia, and elevated liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's MRSA endocarditis is a serious infection that can lead to further complications such as septic emboli, heart valve damage, and systemic infection.
2. Septic Emboli: The patient has already developed septic emboli to the lungs and spleen, which can result in respiratory failure, abscess formation, and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the risk of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Splenic Abscess: The possibility of a splenic abscess should be considered, especially given the known septic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia who has septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. The patient has persistent fevers, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and profound weakness.

The patient's lab values show significant variations throughout the day, including sodium, glucose, WBC count, Hct, platelet count, creatinine, and liver function tests. These fluctuations may indicate errors in lab samples or variations in the patient's condition.

The patient has been treated with vancomycin for MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia. He also received heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 107/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a mildly tachycardic heart rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur, as well as a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds. The patient demonstrates improved strength and can speak fluently.

The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery via a nasal cannula, and his ABG results are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of endocarditis, MRSA pneumonia, weakness, anemia, renal function, hypernatremia, liver"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia who has developed septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. He is experiencing persistent fevers, severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and profound weakness. 

The patient's medical history includes constipation, tachycardia, shock, fever, respiratory failure, impaired health maintenance, pain control, endocarditis, MRSA pneumonia, anemia, renal function, hypernatremia, hip pain, liver function tests (LFT), and full code status. 

In terms of treatment, the patient is being given vancomycin for endocarditis and MRSA pneumonia, Tylenol to treat fevers, and physical therapy to improve weakness. His condition is improving, with reduced fevers and improved vegetation size on echocardiogram. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of liver function, development of additional septic emboli, persistent or worsening tachycardia, and ongoing respiratory issues. It is also important to monitor the patient's glycemic control, nutritional status, and prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE)."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted for infective endocarditis and has been in the ICU with a hospital course notable for persistent weakness and refusal of NGT or G-tube placement. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 C (99.9 F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 117/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough and the inability to tolerate thin liquids. There is no fever, chest pain, or abdominal pain reported. The patient appears comfortable and shows no signs of pain. 

Physical examination reveals a systolic murmur, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, warm skin, and no peripheral edema. Neurological examination is not assessed. 

Lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 315 K/uL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, elevated potassium levels, and decreased albumin. Other lab results including electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac markers are within normal range. 

The patient has been on vancomycin for endocarditis and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are managed by the ICU team.

   Assessment and Plan
   57M w/ MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia with septic emboli to lungs,
   spleen with persistent fevers, severe TR and profound weakness.  Now
   improving, fevers reduced, weakness improved.
   # Endocarditis: continued intermittent fever spikes but improvement in
   vegetation size demonstrated by last echo. HR and RR increase with
   fevers.
   - continue vancomycin
 Vanco level 24 yesterday, but drawn very early,
   repeat level at trough 16.  Trough rechecked per pharmacy recs:
   - treat fevers with Tylenol
 afebrile x24hrs
   #Fevers, increasing white count - endocarditis is the main suspect
   causing fevers.   White count normal today.
   -blood cultures from [**10-7**] no growth x3, urine cultures 10.6 and [**10-3**]
   no growth
   # MRSA Pneumonia: secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
   Patient now extubated, no longer needed oxygen.
   - continue vancomycin
   - suction secretions
   - f/u sputum cx
   # Weakness: Likely myopathy from prolonged ICU course and serious
   illness. Continues to improve today
 still weak, but better, and able
   to speak softly but clearly.  Has been working with PT, was of bed to
   chair.
   - daily PT, outpt PT
   -steadily improving
   # Anemia: patient has demonstrated episodes throughout admission when
   HCT has trended down.  Labs suggest this is multifactorial as
   microcytic picture with elevated ferritin (possibly acute phase
   reactant)
   - continue to trend with daily HCT
s, today 24.2 (25 yesterday).
   # Renal function -   remains stable, creatinine 1.0 today.
   - D5 [**12-29**] normal maintenance yesterday with good resolution of
   hypernatremia.  Now stable on normal saline.
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved as above.
   #L hip pain - bursitis.  No pain with joint examination except direct
   palpation.
   - Continue analgesics as needed.  Lidocaine patch, tylenol.
   # LFT
s:  Aminases remain slightly elevated but stable since admission
   while AP continues to trend up in the setting of a normal and stable
   BR.  This may be secondary to hepatic congestion from severe TR,
   possible septic emboli to liver, or non-hepatic source of AP (bone).
   Obstructive picture is not convincing as BR remains normal.  Elevated
   GGT indicated hepatic source.
   - RUQ US c/w cholelithiasis
   #  Tachycardia:  Stable - This likely represents a physiologic response
   to fever and compensation for severe TR.
   # FEN: Has been unable to pass speech and swallow to this point, but
   has tolerated thickened foods well x2d, given cautiously.  Absolutely
   refuses NG tube and PEG tube.  Will attempt to formally re-evaluate
   speech/swallow [**10-9**], advance diet as possible.  However, with water he
   still coughs with small sips.
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, SQH, bowel regimen, will start H2 blocker.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a diagnosis of MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, who has septic emboli to the lungs and spleen.
- The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has had multiple medical complications.
- The patient's current condition is improving, with reduced fevers and improved weakness.
- The patient still experiences intermittent fever spikes, and his white blood cell count has increased.
- Blood cultures have shown no growth, indicating that the source of infection is likely endocarditis.
- The patient also has pneumonia secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
- The patient's weakness is likely due to myopathy from a prolonged ICU stay and serious illness.
- The patient has anemia, which is multifactorial in nature.
- The patient's renal function remains stable, and hypernatremia has resolved.
- The patient has hip pain due to bursitis, and liver function tests show slightly elevated aminases and alkaline phosphatase levels.
- The patient has a history of tachycardia, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and has refused NG and PEG tubes.
- Prophylactic measures are in place for pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- The patient's disposition is to the floor for continued ICU care.

   57M w/ MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia with septic emboli to lungs,
   spleen with persistent fevers, severe TR and profound weakness.  Now
   improving, fevers reduced, weakness improved.
   # Endocarditis: continued intermittent fever spikes but improvement in
   vegetation size demonstrated by last echo. HR and RR increase with
   fevers.
   - continue vancomycin
 Vanco level 24 yesterday, but drawn very early,
   repeat level at trough 16.  Trough rechecked per pharmacy recs:
   - treat fevers with Tylenol
 afebrile x24hrs
   #Fevers, increasing white count - endocarditis is the main suspect
   causing fevers.   White count normal today.
   -blood cultures from [**10-7**] no growth x3, urine cultures 10.6 and [**10-3**]
   no growth
   # MRSA Pneumonia: secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
   Patient now extubated, no longer needed oxygen.
   - continue vancomycin
   - suction secretions
   - f/u sputum cx
   # Weakness: Likely myopathy from prolonged ICU course and serious
   illness. Continues to improve today
 still weak, but better, and able
   to speak softly but clearly.  Has been working with PT, was of bed to
   chair.
   - daily PT, outpt PT
   -steadily improving
   # Anemia: patient has demonstrated episodes throughout admission when
   HCT has trended down.  Labs suggest this is multifactorial as
   microcytic picture with elevated ferritin (possibly acute phase
   reactant)
   - continue to trend with daily HCT
s, today 24.2 (25 yesterday).
   # Renal function -   remains stable, creatinine 1.0 today.
   - D5 [**12-29**] normal maintenance yesterday with good resolution of
   hypernatremia.  Now stable on normal saline.
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved as above.
   #L hip pain - bursitis.  No pain with joint examination except direct
   palpation.
   - Continue analgesics as needed.  Lidocaine patch, tylenol.
   # LFT
s:  Aminases remain slightly elevated but stable since admission
   while AP continues to trend up in the setting of a normal and stable
   BR.  This may be secondary to hepatic congestion from severe TR,
   possible septic emboli to liver, or non-hepatic source of AP (bone).
   Obstructive picture is not convincing as BR remains normal.  Elevated
   GGT indicated hepatic source.
   - RUQ US c/w cholelithiasis
   #  Tachycardia:  Stable - This likely represents a physiologic response
   to fever and compensation for severe TR.
   # FEN: Has been unable to pass speech and swallow to this point, but
   has tolerated thickened foods well x2d, given cautiously.  Absolutely
   refuses NG tube and PEG tube.  Will attempt to formally re-evaluate
   speech/swallow when available, advance diet as possible.  However, with

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, who has developed septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. He presented with persistent fevers, severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and profound weakness. The patient's condition has been improving, with reduced fevers and improved weakness. 

Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has MRSA endocarditis, which is causing intermittent fever spikes. Vegetation size has improved based on the last echocardiogram. The patient's heart rate and respiratory rate increase with fevers. Vancomycin therapy should be continued, and blood cultures should be monitored for growth.
2. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient developed pneumonia secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis. He is now extubated and no longer requires oxygen. Vancomycin therapy should be continued, and sputum cultures should be followed up.
3. Weakness: The patient's weakness is likely due to myopathy from prolonged ICU stay and serious illness. The patient has shown improvement in speaking softly but clearly and has been working with physical therapy. Daily PT and outpatient PT should be continued.
4. Anemia: The patient has demonstrated episodes of anemia throughout admission with a microcytic picture and elevated ferritin (possibly an acute phase reactant). Daily HCT trends should be continued.
5. Renal Function: The patient's renal function remains stable"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, along with septic emboli to the lungs and spleen. There have been persistent fevers and severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), resulting in profound weakness. However, the patient is now showing improvement in symptoms.
- The patient's white blood cell count is normal, indicating a reduced risk of infection.
- Blood cultures from October 7th showed no growth, suggesting that the source of infection may have been appropriately treated.
- The patient also has pneumonia secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis. Vancomycin therapy is ongoing, and the patient has been extubated and no longer requires oxygen.
- The patient's weakness is likely due to myopathy caused by prolonged ICU stay and serious illness. Physical therapy is being provided to aid in recovery.
- The patient has episodes of anemia throughout the admission, with a microcytic picture and elevated ferritin levels. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
- Renal function remains stable, with a creatinine level of 1.0 today.
- Hypernatremia has resolved, and the patient is now stable on normal saline.
- The patient experiences hip pain due to bursitis, but there is no pain upon joint examination except for direct palpation. Analgesics are being provided as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old with a hospital course notable for infective endocarditis and persistent weakness. The patient refuses NGT or G-tube placement. Current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 108/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal cardiovascular examination findings, except for a systolic murmur. The patient has right lower extremity edema but no left lower extremity edema. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has a diagnosis of infective endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves. Complications of endocarditis can include heart valve damage, heart failure, abscess formation, and embolic events.
2. Impaired health maintenance: The patient's refusal of NGT or G-tube placement may result in inadequate nutrition and hydration, leading to further weakness and potential complications.
3. Critical illness polyneuropathy: The patient's persistent weakness suggests the possibility of critical illness polyneuropathy, a condition commonly seen in critically ill patients. This condition can lead to prolonged weakness and impaired functional status.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, indicating potential respiratory distress or failure. Close monitoring and appropriate"
