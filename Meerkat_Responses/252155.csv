   ECHO
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - try to ween propofol to better assess brain/seizure activity and f/u
   neuro recs today
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support was briefly necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   # Possible Cardiogenic shock: Has edema and uop now down to almost zero
   - BPs stable and appearts fluid overloaded on exam so will try lasix
   today to increase uop (bolus X 1) follow UOP today
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   - F/u neurology recs and wean down propofol prior to their exam to
   allow them to assess seizures.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 6668**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. Above discussed
   with primary care physician: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6684**]. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU taem.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Doing poorly, with seizures off sedation by EEG, few reflexes.
   Plan:
   1. Neurology consult for seizure meds
   2. Diuresis given CXR findings, oliguria
   3. Continue close contact with the family - poor prognosis explained to
   them today

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease. He presented with asystolic cardiac arrest, likely due to respiratory arrest or a recent ischemic event. He required pressor support overnight and is now being weaned off. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which is paroxysmal in nature and remained rate-controlled overnight. He has a coagulopathy likely secondary to warfarin and antibiotic use, resolved with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K. The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level from 1.0 to 2.1 on 02/25. He has evidence of volume overload and may require diuretics. The patient's blood pressure is stable but appears fluid overloaded on examination. There are concerns for possible cardiogenic shock, and he will be given lasix today to increase urine output. The patient experienced twitching movements with weaning of sedation, which could be indicative of seizures, but no coordinated movements were noted. An EEG was performed to further assess for seizures. The patient's neurologic exam is unchanged. He has anemia with a hematocrit level of 27, down from 31 on admission. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 should be managed with insulin sliding scale. He has not had oral intake overnight. The patient's prognosis is poor, and discussions have been held with the family regarding end-of-life care."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Asystolic arrest: Likely etiology is respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest. Unlikely [**1-2**] PE given profound coagulopathy. He was
   hyperkalemic, but this may very well have been secondary to the arrest
   as opposed to the cause of it. There is no evidence of ST-segment
   deviation on ECG nor were there any regional WMAs to suggest acute MI.
   There was no tamponade on echocardiogram. Now on norepinephrine for BP
   support. Initially on therapeutic hypothermia protocol, but given
   profound coagulopathy, this was discontinued. Neuro exam concerning. On
   light sedation, pt is nonrepsonsive with fixed pupils and no corneal
   reflex bilaterally.
   - attempt to wean norepi
   - attempt to wean mechanical ventilation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation. His initial presentation included hypothermia, coagulopathy, and potential acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR (International Normalized Ratio) and is receiving Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to correct the coagulopathy. There is a concern for the possibility of bleeding complications if the coagulopathy is not properly managed.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 2.1 in the past few days. AKI can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and the patient's elevated potassium level (hyperkalemia) may increase the risk of arrhythmias.

3. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection. Infections can complicate the clinical course, especially in critically ill patients.

4. Cardiovascular Status: The patient's echocardiogram showed a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), indicating possible heart failure or other cardiac issues.

5. Neurological Status: The patient is"

   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   .
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   .
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support may be necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest.
- He required pressor support overnight but was able to maintain blood pressure support.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation that is paroxysmal in nature and remained rate-controlled overnight.
- He has a coagulopathy likely due to a combination of warfarin and antibiotic use, which has resolved with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K. He is now on heparin for aortic valve replacement and target partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-90 seconds.
- The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.1 from 1.0 on [Month 25]. Overnight, there was decreased urine output, and his blood pressure is currently normal. If blood pressure normalizes, furosemide may be tried to improve forward flow and increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support may also be necessary.
- The patient experienced twitching movements during sedation weaning, raising concern for seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was unchanged. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded and should provide clear information. Propofol was restarted to resolve the issue.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is holding PO hypoglycemics. Insulin sliding scale is planned"

   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - try to ween propofol to better assess brain/seizure activity and f/u
   neuro recs today
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support was briefly necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   # Possible Cardiogenic shock: Has edema and uop now down to almost zero
   - BPs stable and appearts fluid overloaded on exam so will try lasix
   today to increase uop (bolus X 1) follow UOP today
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   - F/u neurology recs and wean down propofol prior to their exam to
   allow them to assess seizures.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease. He presented with asystolic cardiac arrest and required resuscitation. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypothermia, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, and possible cardiogenic shock. The patient is sedated and intubated, requiring mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about seizures, anemia, and glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient displayed twitching movements during sedation weaning, raising concerns for seizures. An EEG was ordered to provide more information.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.0 to 2.1 in the past few days. This could be due to decreased forward flow caused by poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or decreased volume status. The patient may require diuretics to improve renal perfusion.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has evidence of fluid overload and decreased urine output, suggesting possible cardiogenic shock. Diuretics may be necessary to increase urine output.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient had a coagulopathy likely due to a combination of warfarin use and antibiotic-induced bleeding. This has resolved with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K administration.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit"

   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   .
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   .
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support may be necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.

 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll

   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease.
- He presented with asystolic cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated.
- He required pressor support overnight but was able to maintain blood pressure support.
- An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to rule out seizures, but no evidence of seizure activity was found.
- An echocardiogram showed extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarction, inferior hypokinesis, and findings consistent with multivessel obstructive coronary disease.
- The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 2.1 from 1.0 in the past 24 hours, likely due to decreased forward flow in the setting of poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
- The patient also has acute respiratory failure (ARF) with a pH of 7.27 and pCO2 of 50, which improved with increased tidal volume (TV) to 550 mL and continued oxygen supplementation.
- The patient has been weaned off norepinephrine and is currently maintained on heparin for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and target partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-90 seconds.
- The patient's coagulopathy has resolved with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K"

   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - BP continues to be stable w/o pressors
   - continue ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - Will continue to attempt to diurese (-1Lt) however patient has had
   decreased UOP, but responded to lasix yesterday.
   - Multidisciplinary meeting
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam per Neurology and continue to wean off
   propophol.
   - Continue EEG.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not

   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Most likely related to CHF.
   Urine output improved with furosemide. Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 5077**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s).
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   More seizures today on EEG, despite Keppra load.  Oliguric.  No
   meaningful response to stimulation.  Some brainstem activity with
   occasional spontaneous breaths and a sluggish right corneal reflex.
   Plan:
   1. Palliative care consultation
   2. Family meeting today at 3 pm
   3. Mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support for now

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an increased creatinine level of 2.3, indicating impaired kidney function. This could be due to decreased urine output, as mentioned in the note, or as a result of sepsis or other underlying conditions.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which suggests respiratory failure. This may be due to the initial cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia.

3. Seizures: The patient experienced seizure activity, as indicated by the EEG findings. The cause of these seizures could be brain anoxia, electrolyte imbalances, or medication side effects.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient had episodes of low blood sugar, requiring D50 infusions. Possible causes include poor elimination of insulin in the setting of acute kidney injury or poor glucose production in the setting of cardiac arrest.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient had elevated PT/INR and PTT levels, indicating a bleeding tendency. This could be due to warfarin use, antibiotic-associated coagulopathy, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

7. Infection: The patient may have an underlying infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - BP continues to be stable w/o pressors
   - continue ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - Will continue to attempt to diurese (-1Lt) however patient has had
   decreased UOP, but responded to lasix yesterday.
   - Multidisciplinary meeting
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam per Neurology and continue to wean off
   propophol.
   - Continue EEG.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Most likely related to CHF.
   Urine output improved with furosemide. Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also possible is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease. He presented with asystolic cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been experiencing respiratory difficulties, including dyspnea and choking sensation prior to the arrest. There are indications of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in the left ventricle, suggesting a possible recent ischemic event. However, the most likely cause of the cardiac arrest is a combination of respiratory arrest in the setting of congestive heart failure.

The patient continues to be stable without the need for pressors. Ventilation support will be continued, with a gradual decrease in FiO2 as possible. Diuretic therapy will be continued to manage fluid balance, although the patient has had decreased urine output. A multidisciplinary meeting will be held to discuss the patient's condition and treatment plan.

The patient also experienced seizure activity, as indicated by generalized periodic epileptiform activity on EEG. Neurology recommends continuing levetiracetam and weaning off propofol. The patient's atrial fibrillation is paroxysmal in nature and remains rate-controlled overnight. No anticoagulation medications are currently being administered.

Acute renal failure has developed, with an increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 2.1. This is likely related to congestive heart failure. Urine output has improved with furosemide, so di"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, anemia, and hypoglycemia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving IV antibiotics, and has multiple lines inserted. The patient's condition remains unstable, and there are discussions about the prognosis and desired level of care with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma if not managed properly.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with an elevated creatinine level of 2.3, indicating impaired kidney function. This may further worsen if not appropriately managed.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder, likely due to warfarin and antibiotic use. Close monitoring of clotting parameters is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Infection: As the patient is on antibiotics, there is a risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridium difficile infection. Surveillance for signs of infection is important.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced episodes of hypoglycemia, which may recur if glucose control"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of  respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - BP stable wo pressors
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability). Will continue Levitiracetam and continue to wean off
   propophol. Continue EEG.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Most likely related to CHF.
   Urine output improved with furosemide. Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated but remains in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing dyspnea and choking sensation prior to the cardiac arrest, indicating respiratory distress. His ABG results show a pH of 7.48, suggesting respiratory alkalosis. Continuous ventilatory support and FiO2 adjustment are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Seizure activity: An EEG revealed generalized periodic epileptiform activity, indicating severe brain anoxia and associated with poor outcomes. The patient is on antiepileptic medication (Levitiracetam), and propofol weaning is being continued while monitoring the EEG.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient has had episodes of paroxysmal Afib, which have been rate-controlled overnight. No antiarrhythmic medications are currently being administered.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 2.3, likely due to CHF-related factors. Diuretic therapy has improved urine output, and ongoing diuresis is planned.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has had an elevated PTT and was found to have a combination of warfarin and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. Upon admission, the patient had poor urine output and required aggressive fluid resuscitation. The patient's blood glucose levels were initially elevated but decreased significantly, leading to episodes of hypoglycemia that required dextrose administration.

During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced several medical events. A neuro consult was requested due to abnormal brain activity, and the patient was started on Keppra (levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis. The patient also had a run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) but had normal electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), lactate levels, and blood glucose levels at the time.

The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, with a decrease in blood pressure and worsening renal function, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels. The patient's potassium levels were also low, and additional doses of lasix were given to improve urine output.

The patient's vital signs were relatively stable, with a heart rate between 99-103 beats per minute and a blood pressure ranging from 135/56 to 110/40 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status remained stable on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - try to ween propofol to better assess brain/seizure activity and f/u
   neuro recs today
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support was briefly necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   # Possible Cardiogenic shock: Has edema and uop now down to almost zero
   - BPs stable and appearts fluid overloaded on exam so will try lasix
   today to increase uop (bolus X 1) follow UOP today
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   - F/u neurology recs and wean down propofol prior to their exam to
   allow them to assess seizures.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease. He presented with asystolic cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He required pressor support overnight and has been weaned off it. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a fixed and dilated pupil, which is concerning for a possible seizure. An EEG was ordered to assess brain activity. The patient's blood glucose levels were low, so insulin sliding scale was started. He also has anemia with a hematocrit level of 27%. The patient's kidney function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level of 2.3. He is receiving heparin for atrioventricular valve replacement and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. The family is actively consulting their rabbi regarding the patient's prognosis and is unsure about increasing or withdrawing care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has evidence of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in the left ventricle, indicating a possible recent ischemic event. This could lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and hemodynamic instability.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 2.3, indicating impaired renal function. This could be due to decreased forward flow resulting from poor left ventricular ejection fraction or decreased renal perfusion.
3. Seiz"

   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. The likely etiology of the cardiac arrest includes respiratory arrest leading to cardiac arrest due to dyspnea and choking sensation prior to presentation, or a recent ischemic event resulting in systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in the left ventricle. The patient's current condition includes seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, anemia, and hypoglycemia.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/44 to 73/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased creatinine level, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has also had abnormal coagulation profiles, including prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, which have since resolved with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.

The patient's medical plan includes continued administration of antibiotics, insulin, and anticoagulation"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors, on norepi today
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease. He presented with asystolic cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving vasopressor support.

The family has requested full code status and eventual tracheostomy/PEG if he cannot be weaned off the ventilator within the next 7-10 days. The patient's EEG showed generalized periodic epileptiform activity, indicating severe brain anoxia and associated with poor outcomes.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/44 mmHg to 73/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 24.7 g/dL, platelet count of 264 K/uL, blood glucose level of 76 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, chloride of 108 mEq/L, and magnesium of 2.4 mg/dL.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting. Family wants full code. If seems like futile can stop
   code. Wants eventual trach/peg if 7-10days from now can't be weaned off
   vent. Wants pressors if necessary.
   - A-line d/c'd because of dusky extremities
   - hypoglycemia to 50s-> 1amp D50 given
   - Neurology saw more seizures on EEG so started ativan 2mg Q4H
   - U/A positive so started CTX (h/o proteus and enterococcus in urine
   sensitive to CTX - not cipro)
   - UOP trended down to 15mL/hr after lasix in am wore off. Gave another
   40mg IV lasix with good urine output however, BPs then trended down
   into 70s. Gave 500mL then re-started levophed with pressures into 110s
   and HR 100.
   - On levophed patient developed rapid AF (HR 120s-140s) and BPs
   110s/50s. Gave 5mg IV lopressor and turned down levo as much as BP
   would tolerate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. The etiology of the arrest is unclear but may be due to respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest or a recent ischemic event. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure and was found to have hypokinetic areas in the left ventricle. The family has requested full code status and eventual tracheostomy/PEG if unable to wean off the ventilator in 7-10 days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation with dyspnea and choking sensation suggests respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Seizure Activity: The patient has been experiencing seizure activity, indicating severe brain anoxia and associated with poor outcomes. Continued EEG monitoring and management of seizure medications are necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation, which may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has stable creatinine levels, suggesting ARF likely related to congestive heart failure. Monitoring urine output and careful diuresis management are required.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates a possible combination of warfarin and antibiotic use. Close monitoring"

   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - BP continues to be stable w/o pressors
   - continue ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - Will continue to attempt to diurese (-1Lt) however patient has had
   decreased UOP, but responded to lasix yesterday.
   - Multidisciplinary meeting
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam per Neurology and continue to wean off
   propophol.
   - Continue EEG.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Most likely related to CHF.
   Urine output improved with furosemide. Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. The etiology of the cardiac arrest is likely a combination of respiratory arrest leading to cardiac arrest and systolic failure due to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been on ventilation support and diuresis. He also has seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, anemia, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory arrest leading to cardiac arrest and ongoing ventilation support, there is a risk of pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and barotrauma.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CHF and systolic failure increase the risk of further cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and heart failure exacerbation.

3. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure or require dialysis support.

4. Neurological Complications: The patient's seizure activity indicates brain anoxia, which can lead to long-term neurological disability or death.

5. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections like catheter-related bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

6. Hematological Complications: The patient's co"

   - A-line d/c'd because of dusky extremities
   - hypoglycemia to 50s-> 1amp D50 given
   - Neurology saw more seizures on EEG so started ativan 2mg Q4H
   - U/A positive so started CTX (h/o proteus and enterococcus in urine
   sensitive to CTX - not cipro)
   - UOP trended down to 15mL/hr after lasix in am wore off. Gave another
   40mg IV lasix with good urine output however, BPs then trended down
   into 70s. Gave 500mL then re-started levophed with pressures into 110s
   and HR 100.
   - On levophed patient developed rapid AF (HR 120s-140s) and BPs

   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to

   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors, on norepi today
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR

The patient's current condition includes severe brain anoxia with generalized periodic epileptiform activity on EEG, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure likely related to congestive heart failure, coagulopathy possibly due to warfarin and antibiotic use, anemia with stable hematocrit levels, hypoglycemia of unclear etiology, and complicated urinary tract infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Poor neurological outcome: The presence of severe brain anoxia and generalized periodic epileptiform activity on EEG indicates severe brain injury, which is associated with a high mortality rate and potential for severe neurological disability.

2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. This could potentially lead to hemodynamic instability and further complications such as heart failure or thromboembolic events.

3. Acute renal failure progression: The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to congestive heart failure. If not managed properly, there is a risk of worsening renal function, which may require renal replacement therapy.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely due to warfarin and antibiotic use. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting. Family wants full code. If seems like futile can stop
   code. Wants eventual trach/peg if 7-10days from now can't be weaned off
   vent. Wants pressors if necessary.
   - A-line d/c'd because of dusky extremities
   - hypoglycemia to 50s-> 1amp D50 given
   - Neurology saw more seizures on EEG so started ativan 2mg Q4H
   - U/A positive so started CTX (h/o proteus and enterococcus in urine
   sensitive to CTX - not cipro)
   - UOP trended down to 15mL/hr after lasix in am wore off. Gave another
   40mg IV lasix with good urine output however, BPs then trended down
   into 70s. Gave 500mL then re-started levophed with pressures into 110s
   and HR 100.
   - On levophed patient developed rapid AF (HR 120s-140s) and BPs
   110s/50s. Gave 5mg IV lopressor and turned down levo as much as BP
   would tolerate.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days
   # FEN: NPO
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. The possible etiologies for the cardiac arrest include respiratory arrest leading to cardiac arrest and systolic failure with hypokinetic areas in the left ventricle, indicating a recent ischemic event. However, the most likely cause is a combination of respiratory arrest in the setting of congestive heart failure.

The patient has experienced several medical complications during his ICU stay. These include:

1. Seizure activity: The patient has had generalized periodic epileptiform activity on EEG, which is associated with severe brain anoxia and poor outcomes.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient developed rapid AF after starting norepinephrine, and his blood pressure trended down into the 70s. He was given 5mg IV lopressor and the dose of norepinephrine was decreased.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is stable, and it is most likely related to congestive heart failure. Urine output is being monitored, and careful diuresis is being used as needed.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PT/INR and PTT, likely due to warfarin and antibiotic use. He received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K, resolving the coagulopathy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man who has been admitted to the ICU. He is currently sedated and intubated, with a confirmed diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 101/43 to 163/80 mmHg, heart rate between 82 and 109 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,050 mL and output of 1,947 mL, with urine output being 1,947 mL as well. He is receiving heparin sodium infusion and dextrose 50%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. There are also slight bilateral rhonchi heard on lung examination. The abdomen is soft with no abnormal bowel sounds, and no femoral bruits are present. Neurological examination is limited by sedation, but the patient's pupils are fixed and non-reactive to light. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 75 mg/dL, low magnesium level of 2.5 mg/dL, and elevated lactic acid level of 1.0 mmol/L. Other lab values, such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including a seizure, hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrest, coma, impaired skin integrity, and potential problems like deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is set to full code, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken in the event of a cardiac or respiratory arrest.

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prolonged immobility and presence of atrial fibrillation increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
2. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and the use of pressors may increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum, which can cause bleeding and require urgent intervention.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation and sedation can increase the risk of developing pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. This condition requires prompt identification and treatment to prevent further complications.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's immobilization and potential lack of adequate nutrition or hydration may lead to pressure ulcers or other skin breakdown, which can become infected and complicate the patient's recovery.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent cardiac arrest indicate a predisposition to cardiac rhythm disturbances. Monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to prevent further arrhythmias and associated complications.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune state due to critical illness and prolonged hospitalization increases the risk of developing infections, including hospital-acquired infections like VAP or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests possible anemia, while the elevated BUN level may indicate renal impairment. Close monitoring"

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease. He was admitted to the ICU due to an asystolic cardiac arrest, which was most likely caused by respiratory arrest. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy planned for next week. He has been sedated and intubated.

The patient has had several medical complications during his ICU stay. These include:

1. Seizure activity: The patient experienced seizures, which are indicative of severe brain anoxia and are associated with poor outcomes.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a heart rate less than 100 beats per minute. It is being monitored.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are stable, and his urine output has improved with the use of pressors. It is likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF).

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which is likely a combination of warfarin and antibiotic use. There is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and it has resolved with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. The patient is now on heparin for an upcoming aortic valve replacement (AVR) and has a target partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-90 seconds.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He remains intubated and sedated, and is currently being treated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/43 to 163/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation with a controlled heart rate. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,050 mL and output of 1,947 mL, with positive balance of 103 mL. Respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with settings such as tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, or skin. Neurological examination is limited by sedation but shows fixed and dilated pupils. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated creatinine level, and various electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Infection: The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors, on norepi today
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He had been complaining of dyspnea and choking sensation prior to the arrest. The cause of the cardiac arrest is likely respiratory arrest in the setting of congestive heart failure, possibly combined with a recent ischemic event. The patient has been resuscitated and is currently on mechanical ventilation and pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's age and underlying respiratory issues, there is a risk of pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of PAD and recent cardiac arrest indicate an increased risk of further cardiovascular events, such as arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation.
3. Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output and careful diuresis will be necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated PTT and INR, which may be due to the combination of warfarin and antibiotic use. This increases the risk of bleeding.
5. Seizure Activity: The patient has had seizure activity, indicating severe brain anoxia. Continued EEG monitoring and antiepileptic drug therapy are needed.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced episodes of hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest, likely due to respiratory arrest. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has severe ulcers on his right foot, indicating poor blood circulation. He also has epilepsy, with only some epileptiform discharges observed, but no change in baseline. His INR is currently therapeutic, and he is expected to have his heparin drip discontinued tomorrow.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient's severe ulcers on his right foot increase the risk of infection, which can be particularly dangerous given his compromised immune system due to diabetes and critical condition.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile and has a history of peripheral arterial disease, he is at an increased risk of developing blood clots in his veins, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated and on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent and manage this condition.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, indicating the need for careful monitoring and management of his diabetes, especially since he is unable to take oral hypoglycemic medications.
5. Bleeding: The patient's elevated IN"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with an asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU, intubated and sedated. The patient has severe ulcers on his right foot, consistent with prior documented note by vascular surgery, tendons exposed. He also has epilepsy, with only some epileptiform discharges reported by the neurologist, no change in the baseline. The prognosis is poor. The patient's INR is 3.2 today, and he will be able to discontinue heparin drip tomorrow if it continues to be therapeutic. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, but improving with TF. The patient's renal function is stable, and he has a complicated urinary tract infection for which he was given ceftriaxone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's complicated UTI and the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter increase the risk of developing a healthcare-associated infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and maintaining good hygiene practices can help prevent further complications.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been low, indicating a risk of hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to ensure they remain within a safe range.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing blood clots,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family, family meeting Monday
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - Trach/Peg next week
   # Seizure activity: Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia
   and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam.
   - Neuro to d/c EEG monitoring today as poor prognosis
   # Afib: rate less than 100 overnight.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. U/O improved with
   pressors. Cre mildly elevated vs admission.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin gtt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.  Continue heparin drip for AVR.
   # Hypoglycemia: Improving with TF
   - Will continue D50 infusions as needed.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with an asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU and has been sedated and intubated. The patient has severe ulcers on his right foot, consistent with prior documentation by vascular surgery, and tendons are exposed. The patient also has epilepsy, and neurologist reports only some epileptiform discharges with no change in baseline. The prognosis remains poor. The patient's UOP is good at 8 pm, and INR is at 3.2 today. It is planned to discontinue the heparin drip tomorrow if it continues to be therapeutic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Poor Prognosis: The patient's prognosis is described as poor due to severe brain anoxia and associated outcomes such as mortality or severe neurologic disability.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing hypoglycemia, which is improving with TF (total parenteral nutrition). D50 infusions will continue as needed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF). Urine output has improved with the use of pressors.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely caused by a combination of warfarin and antibiotic use. This has been resolved with fresh frozen plasma ("

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family, family meeting Monday
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - Trach/Peg next week
   # Seizure activity: Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia
   and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam.
   - Neuro to d/c EEG monitoring today as poor prognosis
   # Afib: rate less than 100 overnight.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. U/O improved with
   pressors. Cre mildly elevated vs admission.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin gtt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.  Continue heparin drip for AVR.
   # Hypoglycemia: Improving with TF
   - Will continue D50 infusions as needed.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

- He is currently sedated and intubated in the ICU.
- The patient has severe ulcers on his right foot with tendons exposed, consistent with a prior documented note by vascular surgery.
- The patient has epilepsy, but only some epileptiform discharges were noted, with no change in the baseline. The prognosis is poor.
- The patient's UOP is good at 8 pm, and his INR is at 3.2 today. He will be able to discontinue the heparin drip tomorrow if it remains therapeutic.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- He received a dose of ceftriaxone at 05:00 PM on [**2108-3-3**].
- He is currently receiving heparin sodium at 600 units/hour and pantoprazole (Protonix) at [**2108-3-3**] 10:00 AM.
- Dextrose 50% was started at 01:04 AM on [**2108-3-4**].
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for severe ulcers on the right foot.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 124/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 40%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with an asystolic cardiac arrest, most likely due to respiratory arrest. He was resuscitated and admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, requiring mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he has fixed and dilated pupils, indicating severe brain anoxia. He has been experiencing seizures, which are associated with poor outcomes. The family has agreed to full code status. The patient is expected to undergo a tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy next week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Brain Injury: The patient's severe brain anoxia and ongoing seizure activity on EEG indicate a high risk of hypoxic brain injury. This condition can lead to long-term neurologic disability or death.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is complicated by warfarin use and antibiotic-induced anticoagulation. He has been treated with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K to resolve the coagulopathy, and he is now on a heparin drip for atrioventricular valve replacement (AVR) and to maintain a therapeutic PTT range. The risk of bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage, should be closely monitored.
3. Complicated UTI: The patient has a history of complicated urinary tract infection (UT"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/40-141/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and has fixed and dilated pupils. Neurological examination is limited due to sedation.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic brain injury, indicated by seizure activity on EEG, which suggests severe brain anoxia and associated poor outcomes. The medical team is following neurology recommendations and continuing levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis. The patient's activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is elevated, so he is receiving heparin for anticoagulation and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Coumadin is being held as the international normalized ratio (INR) is at goal.

The patient also has a complicated urinary tract infection for which he was prescribed ceftriaxone for 10 days, with the last dose administered on [**2108-3-11**].

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP):"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Called family to see if could come in for family meeting. They
   thought since nothing had changed they would not like to come in. Will
   consent over the phone for trach/peg
   - RN's wondering why we need heparin as no real consequence of a CVA at
   this point
   - Neuro came by - thought exam better than yesterday - minimally
   responsive to pain and pupils more reactive. EEG consistent with this.
   Prognosis still very grave. Will continue EEG monitoring, get repeat CT

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease. He presented with asystolic cardiac arrest, likely due to respiratory arrest. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute. His blood pressure is stable, with readings ranging from 116/40 to 141/68 mmHg. His heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 80 to 90 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient has an atrial fibrillation rhythm and has been on a heparin drip for atrioventricular block and prolonged prothrombin time. His blood glucose levels are well-controlled, ranging from 70 to 172 mg/dL. He has elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid levels. The patient's neurological examination is limited by sedation, but his pupils are reactive to light. He has a history of seizures, for which he is being treated with levetiracetam. The patient's family has agreed to tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The prognosis remains grave. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory arrest and intubation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest.
- He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/54 mmHg to 138/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 of 40%.
- The patient is sedated and unable to follow commands.
- Physical examination reveals a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, slight bilateral rhonchi, no wheeze or rales anteriorly, soft abdomen, and no femoral bruits.
- Labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and normal potassium and sodium levels.
- The patient has a history of complicated urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxic brain injury.
- The plan includes continuing with sedation, tracheostomy/peg tube placement, peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line, transition to vent weaning, seizure prophylaxis, and management of complicated urinary tract infection.
- The patient's code status is full code, and there are plans for a family meeting today.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease. He presented with asystolic cardiac arrest and has been in the ICU since then. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic brain injury, complicated urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, and acute ventricular rupture. He is on various medications including heparin, levetiracetam, and ceftriaxone.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism.
3. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and pressure from lying in one position for extended periods can lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infections: Being in the ICU increases the risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or surgical site infections.
5. Delirium: Prolonged ICU stay and exposure to multiple medications can increase the risk of developing delirium.
6. Multisystem organ failure: In severe cases, the patient's condition may progress to multisystem organ failure, where multiple organs fail simultaneously.
7. Seizures: Due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic brain injury, complicated urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxic Brain Injury: This occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen, leading to damage and potential long-term neurological disabilities or even death.

2. Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): This infection may progress and cause sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and life-threatening complications.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: This irregular heart rhythm can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the heart, which can travel to other organs and cause complications such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.

4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): This condition impairs the ability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygenation, which can lead to multiorgan failure and increase the risk of mortality.

5. Asystolic Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest indicates a lack of effective heart function, which can be fatal if not promptly addressed.

These are some of the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current health conditions. It is crucial to closely monitor and manage these conditions to prevent further complications and improve the patient's outcome."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and intubated for respiratory support. The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/54 mmHg to 138/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic brain injury: The patient's seizure activity on EEG indicates severe brain anoxia, which is associated with poor outcomes. Neurological recommendations should be followed, and the patient's neurologic status should be reassessed today. Consider discontinuing EEG.

2. Complicated UTI: The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection, for which ceftriaxone has been prescribed for 10 days. The last dose was given on [**2108-3-11**].

3. Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AVR): The patient is now on heparin gtt for AVR and PTT 60-90. Heparin drip should be continued for AVR after trach/peg placement. Coumadin is being held as INR is still at goal and awaiting trach/"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing an asystolic cardiac arrest, likely due to respiratory arrest. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has had a tracheostomy and peg tube placement. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, blood pressure ranging from 135/51 mmHg to 157/73 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a history of seizures. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Brain Injury: The patient has shown some improvement in his neurological examination over the past few days, but he still exhibits seizure activity on EEG, indicating severe brain anoxia and a high risk of mortality or severe neurologic disability.
2. Aortic Valve Regurgitation (AVR): The patient is receiving a heparin drip for AVR and PTT monitoring. He will need to continue the heparin drip after tracheostomy and peg tube placement, and a bridge therapy with Coumadin may be required if the INR is less than 2.5.
3. Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has been prescribed ceftriaxone for 10 days to treat a complicated UTI."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest, most likely due to respiratory arrest. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's neurological exam has shown some improvement over the last few days, but he continues to have seizure activity on EEG, indicating severe brain anoxia with a high mortality rate. He also has a complicated urinary tract infection and is being treated with ceftriaxone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Brain Injury: The patient's severe brain anoxia puts him at high risk for hypoxic brain injury, which can lead to permanent neurological damage and disability.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection caused by bacteria that colonize in the airways.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased blood flow can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, known as DVT.
4. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator can lead to pressure ulcers, which are localized areas of damage to the skin and underlying tissues.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of acquiring additional infections.

   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - failed risbi
   - Trach/Peg today possible at bedside otherwise in OR
   - PICC line to be placed by IR today
   - transition to vent rehab this week
   # Hypoxic brain injury: Despite slightly improved exam over last few
   days, per Neurology seizure activity on EEG indicates severe brain
   anoxia and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability)
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - Cont  Levitiracetam
   - Neuro to reassess today.
   -Consider d/c EEG
   # AVR: Now on heparin gtt for AVR and PTT 60-90.  Continue heparin drip
   for AVRafter trach/peg placed. Holding coumadin for Trach/peg. Will
   need hep bridge for INR less than 2.5.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with an asystolic cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and admitted to the ICU. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been sedated and on assisted ventilation since admission. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/46 to 142/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 36.5°C. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been on heparin for anticoagulation. His central venous pressure is normal at 8 cm. 

On examination, the patient has a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. There are bilateral ronchi on lung auscultation, but no wheezing or crackles anteriorly. The abdomen is soft with no abnormal bowel sounds. No extremity edema or femoral bruits are present. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal renal function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's condition remains critical due to severe hypoxic brain injury resulting in poor neurological outcomes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated but suffered from hypoxic brain injury due to anoxia, resulting in poor neurological outcomes. The patient also has a complicated urinary tract infection and atrioventricular block requiring anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe brain anoxia: The patient's seizure activity on EEG indicates severe brain anoxia, which is associated with a high mortality rate or severe neurologic disability.
2. Complicated UTI: The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection that requires treatment with ceftriaxone for 10 days.
3. AVR (Aortic Valve Regurgitation): The patient is on heparin therapy for AVR and PTT 60-90. After tracheostomy and peg tube placement, the heparin drip will be continued, and coumadin will be held. The patient will need a hep bridge for INR 2.5.
4. DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) prophylaxis: The patient is receiving heparin gtt for DVT prophylaxis.
5. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is on PPI (proton pump inhibitor) therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia) prevention"
