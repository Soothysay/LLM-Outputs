   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with dyspnea and has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) with a pulmonary nodule in the left upper lung. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with biopsies taken and a stent placed to prevent obstruction. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate in the 130s and relative hypotension with blood pressure in the low 100s. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The hemoglobin level is slightly decreased, and the platelet count is within normal range. Electrolyte levels show a slightly low sodium level and normal potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels. Glucose level is within normal range.

Imaging results from the chest X-ray reveal a left upper lung mass with a tracheal stent in place. There is also a curvilinear lucency to the left of the stent, which may represent small pneumomediastinum.

The echocardiogram shows moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 35%. There is extensive anteroapical akinesis, mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The"

   Assessment/Summary
   44yo gentleman with h/o recently discovered pulmonary malignancy
   presenting with dyspnea x 2 days. Large lung mass encasing PA. Troponin
   leak and somewhat diffuse ST elevation, but clean coronaries on cath.
   Neagtive CTA in ED and negative pulmonary angiogram in cath lab. Wedge
   20 mmHg, mildly elevated. Echo with regional wall motion
   abnormality.Lung cancer and spine met due for radiotherapy yesterday.
   When stable will need emergent radiotherapy. Leading hypothesis is
   acute onset is both reduced lung volume and acute onset mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Plan
   # Pulmonary Mass
   Ddx includes adenocarcinoma vs primary thyroid malignancy. It is
   incasing pulmonary artery. Slightly and likely acutely increased wedge
   with likely sudden onset mild pulmonary hypertension. Thus likely
   worsened lung volumes and perfusion. PA HTN most likely [**12-23**] elevated
   wedge and from mass effect. Pt s/p tracheal stent in anticipation of
   radiation.
   - Pt to start radiation therapy to reduce tumor burden that are likely
   the explanation behind these cardiopulmonary sequelae
   - Oncology recs, appreciate input
   - F/u path report of biopsy
   - Chemo to start once diagnosis is confirmed.
   - Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] today
   # Anemia, normocytic, acute on chronic
   Baseline Hct unknown (but pt states he has recent h/o anemia),
   admission Hct 28. Post transfusion recheck of 26. Presence of
   tachycardia suggests hemodynamic instability. He denies black or bloody
   stools, groin pain/hematoma. There is no clear source of bleeding.
   Would consider the possibility of marrow suppression or hemolysis.
   However, t-bili normal. Is s/p 2 units. Caution retroperitoneal bleed.
   - trend hemolysis labs
   - will monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Keep HCT between 26 and 30.
   - Obtain formal smear
   - Obtain retic
   # Shortness of breath and Hypoxia
   Most likely [**12-23**] V/Q mismatch caused by direct and indirect inflammatory
   effects of the large mass on the lung. PE, CHF, MI ruled out. Consider
   obesity/hypoventilation as a contributor.
   - Attempt to wean down O2
   - Consider emperic antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if spikes or
   decompensates
   # Cardiomyopathy: EF of 35%. Focality suggests ischemic in nature,
   however, clean coronaries. Consider autolysed thrombus. Possibly
   secondary to large mass causing increasing PA and wedge pressures and
   wall motion defects.
   - Monitor
   # Leukocytosis with 3% bands
   Per above question of post obstructive PNA. [**Month (only) 8**] also represent primary
   lymphoma, leukemia. Less likely and dx of exclusion would be stress
   response to primary malignancy.
   - Tissue for lung mass
   - Consider empiric antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if becomes
   hemodynamically unstable per above
   - f./u  urine, blood, and sputum Cx
   - Monitor WBC count
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved with hypertonic saline Therefore likely SIADH. Euvolemic, most
   consistent with SIADH and probable mixed picture with some hypovolemia.
   Went from 121 to 119. Pt developed some confusion later overnight,
   concerning for cerebral edema.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of recently discovered pulmonary malignancy presenting with dyspnea for two days. The patient has a large lung mass encasing the pulmonary artery, troponin leak, and diffuse ST elevation. Coronary angiogram showed clean coronaries, ruling out pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction. The patient also has anemia, normocytic, acute on chronic, and elevated white blood cell count with 3% bands. 

The patient's shortness of breath and hypoxia are likely caused by a V/Q mismatch due to direct and indirect inflammatory effects of the large mass on the lung. The cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35% suggests ischemic in nature but clean coronaries. 

The patient's leukocytosis with 3% bands could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia or primary lymphoma/leukemia. Hyponatremia improved with hypertonic saline, suggesting SIADH. Elevated cardiac biomarkers and ST elevation are likely due to demand ischemia. 

Sinus tachycardia may be caused by hypovolemia, hypoxia, or infection. The patient's back pain/bone pain is chronic and requires pain management. 

The patient should be transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] today for further evaluation and treatment. The plan includes starting radiation therapy to reduce tumor burden,"

   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or patent
   foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
   maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to extensive
   anteroapical akinesis. The basal segments of the left ventricle are
   hyperdynamic. There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
   obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal
   hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment/Summary
   44yo gentleman with h/o recently discovered pulmonary malignancy
   presenting with dyspnea x 2 days. Large lung mass encasing PA. Troponin
   leak and somewhat diffuse ST elevation, but clean coronaries on cath.
   Neagtive CTA in ED and negative pulmonary angiogram in cath lab. Wedge
   20 mmHg, mildly elevated. Echo with regional wall motion
   abnormality.Lung cancer and spine met due for radiotherapy yesterday.
   When stable will need emergent radiotherapy. Leading hypothesis is
   acute onset is both reduced lung volume and acute onset mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Plan
   # Pulmonary Mass
   Ddx includes adenocarcinoma vs primary thyroid malignancy. It is
   incasing pulmonary artery. Slightly and likely acutely increased wedge
   with likely sudden onset mild pulmonary hypertension. Thus likely
   worsened lung volumes and perfusion. PA HTN most likely [**12-23**] elevated
   wedge and from mass effect. Pt s/p tracheal stent in anticipation of
   radiation.
   - Pt to start radiation therapy to reduce tumor burden that are likely
   the explanation behind these cardiopulmonary sequelae
   - Oncology recs, appreciate input
   - F/u path report of biopsy
   - Chemo to start once diagnosis is confirmed.
   - Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] today
   # Anemia, normocytic, acute on chronic
   Baseline Hct unknown (but pt states he has recent h/o anemia),
   admission Hct 28. Post transfusion recheck of 26. Presence of
   tachycardia suggests hemodynamic instability. He denies black or bloody
   stools, groin pain/hematoma. There is no clear source of bleeding.
   Would consider the possibility of marrow suppression or hemolysis.
   However, t-bili normal. Is s/p 2 units. Caution retroperitoneal bleed.
   - trend hemolysis labs
   - will monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Keep HCT between 26 and 30.
   - Obtain formal smear
   - Obtain retic
   # Shortness of breath and Hypoxia
   Most likely [**12-23**] V/Q mismatch caused by direct and indirect inflammatory
   effects of the large mass on the lung. PE, CHF, MI ruled out. Consider
   obesity/hypoventilation as a contributor.
   - Attempt to wean down O2
   - Consider emperic antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if spikes or
   decompensates
   # Cardiomyopathy: EF of 35%. Focality suggests ischemic in nature,
   however, clean coronaries. Consider autolysed thrombus. Possibly
   secondary to large mass causing increasing PA and wedge pressures and
   wall motion defects.
   - Monitor
   # Leukocytosis with 3% bands
   Per above question of post obstructive PNA. [**Month (only) 8**] also represent primary
   lymphoma, leukemia. Less likely and dx of exclusion would be stress
   response to primary malignancy.
   - Tissue for lung mass
   - Consider empiric antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if becomes
   hemodynamically unstable per above
   - f./u  urine, blood, and sputum Cx
   - Monitor WBC count
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved with hypertonic saline Therefore likely SIADH. Euvolemic, most

   s/p tracheal stent placement in hte upper thoracic trachea. left upper
   lung
   mass unchanged, extending to hilum. of note, there is a curvilinear
   lucency
   to the left of the stent, which may represent small pneumomediastinum,
   though
   no ohter evidence of mediastinal air is seen.
   ECHO [**2133-2-19**]
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or patent
   foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
   maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to extensive
   anteroapical akinesis. The basal segments of the left ventricle are
   hyperdynamic. There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
   obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal
   hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CTA [**2133-2-19**]:
   1. No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary
   hypertension.
   2. Large pleural based mass extending into the left upper lobe, found
   to
   likely represent non-small carcinoma per outside hospital ([**Hospital1 12340**]) biopsy report. A smaller left posterior apical opacity is
   concerning
   for a second mass lesion.
   3. Multifocal RUL ground-glass opacities, non-specific but could
   represent
   infection, inflammation, or neoplastic process.
   4. Enlarged, thyroid containing large thyroid nodules extending into
   the
   anterior mediastinum, substernally. If these findings have not
   previously
   been further evaluated, further work-up is suggested.
   5. 2.3 cm ill-defined hypodense segment VII hepatic lesion. 2.4 cm
   right
   adrenal nodule. Recommend MRI for further characterization.

   Assessment/Summary
   44yo gentleman with h/o recently discovered pulmonary malignancy
   presenting with dyspnea x 2 days. Large lung mass encasing PA. Troponin
   leak and somewhat diffuse ST elevation, but clean coronaries on cath.
   Neagtive CTA in ED and negative pulmonary angiogram in cath lab. Wedge
   20 mmHg, mildly elevated. Echo with regional wall motion
   abnormality.Lung cancer and spine met due for radiotherapy yesterday.
   When stable will need emergent radiotherapy. Leading hypothesis is
   acute onset is both reduced lung volume and acute onset mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Plan
   # Pulmonary Mass
   Ddx includes adenocarcinoma vs primary thyroid malignancy. It is
   incasing pulmonary artery. Slightly and likely acutely increased wedge
   with likely sudden onset mild pulmonary hypertension. Thus likely
   worsened lung volumes and perfusion. PA HTN most likely [**12-23**] elevated
   wedge and from mass effect. Pt s/p tracheal stent in anticipation of
   radiation.
   - Pt to start radiation therapy to reduce tumor burden that are likely
   the explanation behind these cardiopulmonary sequelae
   - Oncology recs, appreciate input
   - F/u path report of biopsy
   - Chemo to start once diagnosis is confirmed.
   - Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] today
   # Anemia, normocytic, acute on chronic
   Baseline Hct unknown (but pt states he has recent h/o anemia),
   admission Hct 28. Post transfusion recheck of 26. Presence of
   tachycardia suggests hemodynamic instability. He denies black or bloody
   stools, groin pain/hematoma. There is no clear source of bleeding.
   Would consider the possibility of marrow suppression or hemolysis.
   However, t-bili normal. Is s/p 2 units. Caution retroperitoneal bleed.
   - trend hemolysis labs
   - will monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Keep HCT between 26 and 30.
   - Obtain formal smear
   - Obtain retic
   # Shortness of breath and Hypoxia
   Most likely [**12-23**] V/Q mismatch caused by direct and indirect inflammatory
   effects of the large mass on the lung. PE, CHF, MI ruled out. Consider
   obesity/hypoventilation as a contributor.
   - Attempt to wean down O2
   - Consider emperic antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if spikes or
   decompensates
   # Cardiomyopathy: EF of 35%. Focality suggests ischemic in nature,
   however, clean coronaries. Consider autolysed thrombus. Possibly
   secondary to large mass causing increasing PA and wedge pressures and
   wall motion defects.
   - Monitor
   # Leukocytosis with 3% bands
   Per above question of post obstructive PNA. [**Month (only) 8**] also represent primary
   lymphoma, leukemia. Less likely and dx of exclusion would be stress
   response to primary malignancy.
   - Tissue for lung mass
   - Consider empiric antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if becomes
   hemodynamically unstable per above
   - f./u  urine, blood, and sputum Cx
   - Monitor WBC count
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved with hypertonic saline Therefore likely SIADH. Euvolemic, most
   consistent with SIADH and probable mixed picture with some hypovolemia.
   Went from 121 to 119. Pt developed some confusion later overnight,
   concerning for cerebral edema.
   - Fluid restrict to 1.2L
   - Get OSH/PCP records to see if longer standing
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Monitor sodium

   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers and ST elevation
   Likely demand. Clean caths. Not parsimonious but possible regional
   myocarditis or dissolved clot.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.
   - intubation will be done
   - after intubation will need to go to XRT for pulm mass treatment and
   other studies
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component of baseline personality/coping
   mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia.
   - Fluid restrict (pt [**Name (NI) 2938**]
   - Obtain records for baseline Na
   - f/u renal recs
   - question if free water restrcition < 1000 mL/day is necessary
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   6.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   7.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - follow up as opt for echo
   .
   8.  Anemia.  Baseline Hct unknown and no clear source of bleeding.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend Hct
   - obtain baseline Hct
   - anemia studies
   .
   9. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   10.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass, was admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement. The respiratory status decompensated, leading to hypoxia/hypercapnia and altered mental status. Intubation was performed, and the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of back pain, which is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and invasion of T11, T12, and L5 with metastatic disease. The lung mass is suggestive of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma subtype, but pathology is pending. The patient is scheduled for radiation therapy (XRT) to treat the lung mass and other studies.

The patient presented with hyponatremia, which may be consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) +/- hypovolemia. Fluid restriction has been initiated, and renal recommendations are being followed.

Tachycardia is present, possibly secondary to dehydration, large lung mass, pneumomediastinum, or infection. Monitoring on telemetry, IV fluid boluses, pain control, and follow-up cultures are planned.

Leukocytosis is noted, likely secondary to prednisone use for back pain. Cultures are being followed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy, now resolved.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - XRT notified of his arrival here
   - if respiratory status decompensates, will need to intubate.
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - XRT today
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology
   .
   2.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia.
   - Fluid restrict (pt [**Name (NI) 2938**]
   - Obtain records for baseline Na
   - renal recs
   - free water restrcition < 1000 mL/day
   - repeat urine sodium and osms
   - high protein diet to increase urea
   .
   3.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele
   - ivf boluses
   - pain control
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   4.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   .
   5.  Anemia.  Baseline Hct unknown and no clear source of bleeding.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend Hct
   - obtain baseline Hct
   - anemia studies
   .
   6. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   7.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath, likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement. No current evidence of pneumonia was found, but there is a small pneumomediastinum noted on the chest X-ray, which has since resolved.

The patient's medical history includes a pathological L4 fracture and invasion of T11, T12, and L5 with metastatic disease, as well as a possible diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma type, based on prior pathology results. The patient's current condition includes hyponatremia, tachycardia, leukocytosis, anemia, sinus tachycardia, and back pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The large lung mass may continue to compress the airway, leading to worsening respiratory distress. Close monitoring and potential intubation if necessary.

2. Pneumonia: Although the current chest X-ray does not show any evidence of pneumonia, the patient's compromised respiratory status puts him at risk for developing post-obstructive pneumonia.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has evidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which may be exacerbated by further stress or complications.

4. Infection"

   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D1 of vanc/cefepime in [**2-22**], continue as long as intubate
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday

   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following

   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia. It resolved
   with fluid replacement
   - trend Na

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass, admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) due to compression of the airway by the lung mass.
- The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement. No current evidence of pneumonia was found.
- The patient's respiratory status deteriorated, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and altered mental status. He was intubated on [2-22] for altered mental status and the need for radiation therapy and MRI.
- On [2-22], the patient experienced febrile temperatures, mild bump in WBC count, and trauma.
- The patient has been on vanc/cefepime since [2-22].
- The patient is hypotensive and requires Levophed support.
- The patient has a lung mass that is likely the source of SOB and may benefit from radiation therapy.
- The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to medication-induced effects, metabolic abnormalities, or coping mechanism.
- The patient had hyponatremia, which resolved with fluid replacement.
- The patient has tachycardia, possibly secondary to dehydration, pain, large lung mass, or pneumomediastinum.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which may be secondary to prednisone use or post-obstructive pneumonia.
- The patient may have Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   #.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D2 of vanc/cefepime on [**2-22**] for presumed pneumonia, continue as long
   as intubate. Positive GPC in sputum, f/up sputum cx, contact
   precautions
   - continue current vent settings, attempt to place A-line for ABG
   assessment
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   - f/up hemodynamic status after receiving 3 units PRBC, adjust pressor
   support accordingly given possible preload-dependence
   .
   #.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   #. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   #.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with SIADH +/- hypovolemia. It has
   resolved with fluid replacement
   - trend Na
   - UA, Ulytes
   .
   #.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - repeat echo today
   .
   #.  Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Baseline Hct/plt unknown and no clear
   source of bleeding. Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease vs.
   hemolysis. Plt decrease could be secondary to DIC
   - trend Hct, plt
   - transfuse 3 units PRBC today, goal hct > 26, plt >30
   - f/up smears, DIC labs for possible microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
   - f/up Hem/Onc recs
   .
   #. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   #.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement, which resulted in respiratory decompensation and subsequent intubation. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, and contact precautions have been implemented due to positive Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the sputum culture.

The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient's blood work indicates leukocytosis, hyponatremia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's cardiac status is complicated by apical akinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, but cardiac catheterization was negative for coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's imaging studies reveal bilateral adrenal nodules, liver lesions, and ground glass opacities in the lung, which may indicate an infectious process.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, and there is a positive GPC in the sputum culture. Monitoring for clinical improvement and following up with sputum cultures are necessary.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient's mental status changes and hyponatremia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D1 of vanc/cefepime on [**2-22**] for presumed pneumonia, continue as long
   as intubate. Positive GPC in sputum, f/up sputum cx, contact
   precautions
   - continue current vent settings, attempt to place A-line for ABG
   assessment
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   - f/up hemodynamic status after receiving 3 units PRBC, adjust pressor
   support accordingly given possible preload-dependence
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with SIADH +/- hypovolemia. It has
   resolved with fluid replacement
   - trend Na
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   6.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   7.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - repeat echo today
   .
   8.  Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Baseline Hct/plt unknown and no clear
   source of bleeding. Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease vs.
   hemolysis. Plt decrease could be secondary to DIC
   - trend Hct, plt
   - transfuse 3 units PRBC today, goal hct > 26, plt >30
   - f/up smears, DIC labs for possible microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
   - f/up Hem/Onc recs
   .
   9. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   10.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement for the lung mass. However, his respiratory status decompensated, leading to hypoxia/hypercapnia and altered mental status. He was subsequently intubated on February 22nd.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive with sedation and ventilation, requiring norepinephrine (Levophed) for pressor support.

2. Lung mass: The patient has a large lung mass that is likely the source of his SOB. Biopsy results suggest non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), specifically adenocarcinoma, but further confirmation is needed. Radiation therapy (XRT) has been recommended to treat the lung mass.

3. Altered mental status: The patient exhibited agitation and combativeness, which could be attributed to medication-induced effects, metabolic abnormalities, or coping mechanisms. An MRI of the head was ordered to rule out bleeding or tumor involvement.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient had altered mental status and hyponatremia, which resolved with fluid replacement. Renal involvement with SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass, was admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) due to compression of the airway by the lung mass. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement. His respiratory status deteriorated, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation on [**2-22**] for altered mental status (AMS) and the need for radiation and MRI. The patient also experienced febrile temperatures and a mild increase in white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive during sedation and ventilation, requiring Levophed support.
2. Lung mass: The patient has a large lung mass causing SOB and potentially compressing the bronchus. Prior pathology suggests non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma type, but is not conclusive. The patient may benefit from radiation therapy (XRT).
3. Altered mental status: The patient exhibited agitation and combativeness, thought to be a combination of medication-induced, metabolic abnormality, and possible coping mechanism.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient had altered mental status and hyponatremia, which resolved with fluid replacement.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be secondary to dehydration, pain, large lung mass, or pneumomediastinum.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count without clear evidence of infection, possibly secondary to prednisone use prior to admission.
7. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: The patient's EKG showed ST elevations, but cardiac catheterization was negative. An echocardiogram revealed extensive anteroapical akinesis with an ejection fraction of 35%.
8. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia with an unknown baseline hematocrit and platelet count, likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
9. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia may be due to respiratory distress and/or dehydration.
10. Back pain: The patient's back pain is secondary to a pathological L4 fracture and invasion of T11, T12, and L5 with metastatic disease.

The patient's current condition in the ICU includes mechanical ventilation, ongoing sedation, and the administration of antibiotics, pressor support, and pain management. Further diagnostic tests and treatments are planned, including radiation therapy for the lung mass, evaluation for potential infections, and monitoring of electrolyte imbalances and cardiovascular status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D1 of vanc/cefepime in [**2-22**], continue as long as intubate
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia. It resolved
   with fluid replacement
   - trend Na
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   6.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   7.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - follow up as opt for echo
   .
   8.  Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Baseline Hct/plt unknown and no clear
   source of bleeding. Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease. Plt
   decrease could be
   - trend Hct, plt
   - transfuse as needed, goal hct > 26, plt >30
   .
   9. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   10.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement. He experienced respiratory decompensation and hypoxia/hypercapnia with altered mental status, leading to intubation on [**2-22**] for altered mental status and the need for radiation, MRI. The patient also had febrile temperatures on [**2-22**], mild bump in WBC, and hypotension requiring Levophed support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension - the patient became hypotensive with sedation and ventilation, requiring pressor support with Levophed.
2. Lung mass - the patient had a large lung mass causing SOB, which was biopsied by rigid bronchoscopy. The pathology suggests non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma, but is not conclusive. The lung mass may benefit from radiation therapy (XRT).
3. Altered mental status - the patient was agitated and combative, possibly due to medication-induced effects, metabolic abnormalities, or coping mechanisms. Sedation and ventilation were provided for treatment.
4. Hyponatremia - the patient had altered mental status and hyponatremia, which resolved with fluid replacement. Renal dysfunction is suspected as the"
