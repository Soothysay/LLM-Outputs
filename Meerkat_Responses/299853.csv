","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been stable since admission with no acute events. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 77 bpm (range 74-88), blood pressure of 114/58 mmHg (range 71-133/63-76), respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (range 12-25), and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient has a first-degree AV block as seen on EKG. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 81 kg. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,342 mL and output of 250 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,092 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with SpO2 of 100%. ABG results are not provided. Physical examination findings are incomplete, with assessments not performed on peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and other systems. Lab results indicate normal levels of glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. However, the patient's hemoglobin level is low at 9.3 g/dL, and hematocrit is 28.5%. Imaging shows no acute process on chest X-ray. The patient has been placed on proph"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation, and dementia. He presented with melena and a decrease in hemoglobin levels, indicating potential gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells in the emergency department. His baseline hemoglobin level from November 29th was 35, indicating pre-existing anemia. He is currently hemodynamically stable.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications:

1. GI bleed/Acute blood-loss anemia: The patient may have experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleed, as evidenced by brown fluid on nasogastric lavage. However, it could also be from a lower gastrointestinal source. He is on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, but this is not reflected in his coagulation results. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells. His baseline hemoglobin was 35, and he is now normocytic. Further management includes monitoring his hemoglobin levels every 4 hours until stabilization, initiating IV proton pump inhibitor therapy, holding lovenox, conducting a type and screen with crossmatch, considering a gastrointestinal scope on Monday unless he becomes hemodynamically unstable or the bleeding does not stop.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, likely due to the gastrointestinal bleed. There is a possible left lower lobe opacity, for which"
