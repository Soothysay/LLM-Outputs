","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, with appropriate eye contact and responsiveness to commands. There have been fluctuations in lactate levels, which indicate possible inadequate tissue perfusion or ongoing sepsis. The patient has a history of cirrhosis and alcohol use, and they are experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory alkalosis, hypotonic hyponatremia, pulmonary hypertension, and a knowledge deficit. The patient's abdominal pain has not improved and is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is NPO for planned extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and alcohol use puts them at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause confusion, altered level of consciousness, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires mechanical ventilation. If there are any complications with the ventilator or the patient's respiratory status, it could lead to further respiratory failure.
3. Hypotonic Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can cause symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and muscle cramps. It is important to monitor and manage this electrolyte imbalance carefully.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 41 yo M with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with
   Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism who presents with
   his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection.
   # Somnolence.  Again prompting respiratory code and intubation for
   airway protection on floor.  Differential has included hepatic
   encephalopathy (worsening overnight with no overnight doses of
   lactulose), OSA or other sleep disordered breathing, or new type of
   neurologic event.   Also consider electrolyte abnormality (alkalemia
   stable, hyponatremia with improvement overnight), infection (SBP - last
   tap 3 days ago, afebrile, no abdominal tenderness; CXR clear, consider
   urine/blood).  Glucose normal.  Regarding hepatic encephalopathy,
   patient getting lactulose, rifaximin, and low dose flagyl.  Regarding
   sleep disorder breathing, patient had sleep study 3 nights ago with
   suggestion of mild-mod OSA, no REM sleep achieved.  On CPAP 2 nights
   ago for trial, unclear if was getting this last night.  Currently
   worrisome is that he is minimally responsive currently - ?neurologic
   event or subclincal status, vs. residual medication effect or hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Neurologic exam similar to previous presentations
   (initially with minimal responsiveness, then rapidly improving).  Most
   likely explanation is severe hepatic encephalopathy with overnight
   break from lactulose, as these episodes have all occurred within a few
   hours of 8am meds (no lactulose for at least 8-10 hours).  If sleep
   disordered breathing related, could expect these events to occur
   sporadically throughout night instead of consistently 6-7am.
   -          Treat aggressively for hepatic encephalopathy  - lactulose
   Q2H to start until mental status clearing, continue rifaximin and
   flagyl.  [**Month (only) 51**] need specific overnight wakeup for lactulose.
   -          Possible OSA
 consider CPAP upon extubation (trial 2 nights
   ago).
   -          Management of hyponatremia as below.
   -          Infectious workup
 check UA; no indication to tap ascites
   currently (last tap 3 days ago), consider blood cultures.  No fever,
   leukocytosis, or systemic signs of infection.
   -          Consider tox screens, have been negative except benzos
   (after received in hospital) in past.
   -          Extubation once mental status clears (keep on [**4-24**] for now).
    # Respiratory alkalosis/metabolic acidosis.  Stable pH at 7.50 with
   significant respiratory alkalemia.  Taking large breaths on vent.
   Likely related to ascites/large abdomen with other hormonal effects
   from cirrhosis.  Also with metabolic acidosis
 in part compensatory
   for respiratory alkalosis, but bicarb dropping throughout this
   admission, likely an effect of increasing lactulose requirements
   leading to worsening diarrhea and bicarb losses.
   -          Continue with PSV on vent at current settings ([**4-24**]).
   -          Check urinary anion gap
 anticipate seeing negative gap due
   to GI losses of bicarb.
   # Hyponatremia: Stable in 120s.  Has been in the low 130s previously on
   this admission.  Yesterday with Na 118, up to 126 this AM.  Unlikely to
   be primary cause of altered mental status.
   -          1 L fluid restriction once taking PO.
   -          Hold diuretics
   -          Avoid rapid correction of Na if drops again.
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   - lactulose, rifaximin, flagyl as above.
   -holding diuretics for now
   -continue prophylactic cipro (SBP).
   - follow up hepatology recs
    # Pulmonary HTN: on iloprost and sildenifil at home.  Sildenifil

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, presenting with his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient has been treated for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose, rifaximin, and low-dose flagyl. There is a suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other sleep-disordered breathing, which has been managed with CPAP. The patient also has hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis, likely due to ascites and hormonal effects from cirrhosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, disorientation, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient may have OSA, which can contribute to episodes of altered mental status during sleep.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to respiratory complications.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion and altered mental status.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, which may be related to lactulose treatment and worsening diarrhea.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 41 yo M with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with
   Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism who presents with
   his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection.
   # Somnolence and respiratory failure.  Again prompting respiratory code
   and intubation for airway protection on floor.  Differential has
   included hepatic encephalopathy (worsening overnight with no overnight
   doses of lactulose), OSA or other sleep disordered breathing.  Most
   likely explanation is severe hepatic encephalopathy with overnight
   break from lactulose, as these episodes have all occurred within a few
   hours of 8am meds (no lactulose for at least 8-10 hours).
   -          Treat aggressively for hepatic encephalopathy  - now
   lactulose TID to maintain 4+ BM/day, continue rifaximin and flagyl.
   [**Month (only) 51**] need specific overnight wakeup for lactulose.
   -          Possible OSA
 consider CPAP upon extubation.
   -          Extubation likely today.
   -          Discussion yesterday re: possible trach.  Would clearly be
   beneficial if this process is due to obstructive apnea.  Would also be
   beneficial if central apnea in that could easily be hooked up to vent
   (but ?need to go to vent facility following discharge) as opposed to
   repeated intubations and potential hypoxic exposures.  Will discuss
   with liver team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2249**].
    # Respiratory alkalosis/metabolic acidosis.  Respiratory drive likely
   related to ascites/large abdomen with other hormonal effects from
   cirrhosis.  Also with metabolic acidosis
 may be in part compensatory
   for respiratory alkalosis, but bicarb dropping throughout this
   admission, likely an effect of increasing lactulose requirements
   leading to worsening diarrhea and bicarb losses.
   -          Continue with PSV on vent at current settings ([**4-24**]), plan
   extubate today.
   -          Recheck urinary anion gap (was dry yesterday during check)
   # Hyponatremia: Improving.
   -          1 L fluid restriction once taking PO.
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   - lactulose, rifaximin, flagyl as above.
   -holding diuretics for now as still appears dry.
   -continue prophylactic cipro (SBP).
   - follow up hepatology recs
    # Pulmonary HTN: on iloprost and sildenifil at home.  Sildenifil
   discontinued on floor due to concern of worsening OSA.  No evidence
   that this or other decompensations were related to pulmonary
   hypertension, as remains hemodynamically stable during these events.
   -          continue to hold both sildenifil and iloprost for now.
   # Leukocytosis.  To 18K yesterday, now trending down. ?stress response
   from intubation/resp failure.
   -          f/u c.diff
   -          trend fever curve; defer para given lack of abd pain
   currently.
   # Epistaxis.  Noted to have blood in nose during event.  No current
   bleeding.  Neither OGT or ETT suctioning returning blood.
   -          continue to monitor for now
   -          can restart HSQ.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, who presents with his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. 

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, hypothyroidism, hepatic encephalopathy, and has been on the transplant list. He is currently receiving treatment for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose, rifaximin, and flagyl. The possibility of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is also being considered, and CPAP may be considered upon extubation. 

The patient is experiencing respiratory alkalosis/metabolic acidosis, likely related to ascites/large abdomen and hormonal effects from cirrhosis. Fluid restriction and holding diuretics have been recommended. Prophylactic ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and follow-up hepatology recommendations are also part of the plan.

The patient has leukocytosis, which is trending down, possibly due to stress response from intubation/resp failure. Monitoring for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is advised. The patient has a history of epistaxis (nosebleed) but currently has no bleeding. 

The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine. The ICU care includes"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 41 yo M with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with
   Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism who presents with
   his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection.
   # Somnolence.  Again prompting respiratory code and intubation for
   airway protection on floor.  Differential has included hepatic
   encephalopathy (worsening overnight with no overnight doses of
   lactulose), OSA or other sleep disordered breathing.  Most likely
   explanation is severe hepatic encephalopathy with overnight break from
   lactulose, as these episodes have all occurred within a few hours of
   8am meds (no lactulose for at least 8-10 hours).
   -          Treat aggressively for hepatic encephalopathy  - now
   lactulose Q4-6H to start until mental status clearing, continue
   rifaximin and flagyl.  [**Month (only) 51**] need specific overnight wakeup for
   lactulose.
   -          Possible OSA
 consider CPAP upon extubation (trial 2 nights
   ago).
   -          Extubation today
    # Respiratory alkalosis/metabolic acidosis.  Stable pH at 7.50 with
   significant respiratory alkalemia.  Taking large breaths on vent.
   Likely related to ascites/large abdomen with other hormonal effects
   from cirrhosis.  Also with metabolic acidosis
 in part compensatory
   for respiratory alkalosis, but bicarb dropping throughout this
   admission, likely an effect of increasing lactulose requirements
   leading to worsening diarrhea and bicarb losses.
   -          Continue with PSV on vent at current settings ([**4-24**]).
   -          Check urinary anion gap
 anticipate seeing negative gap due
   to GI losses of bicarb.
   # Hyponatremia: Stable in 120s.  Has been in the low 130s previously on
   this admission.  Yesterday with Na 118, up to 126 this AM.  Unlikely to
   be primary cause of altered mental status.
   -          1 L fluid restriction once taking PO.
   -          Hold diuretics
   -          Avoid rapid correction of Na if drops again.
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   - lactulose, rifaximin, flagyl as above.
   -holding diuretics for now
   -continue prophylactic cipro (SBP).
   - follow up hepatology recs
    # Pulmonary HTN: on iloprost and sildenifil at home.  Sildenifil
   discontinued yesterday due to concern of worsening OSA.  No evidence
   that this or other decompensations were related to pulmonary
   hypertension, as remains hemodynamically stable during these events.
   -          continue to hold both sildenifil and iloprost for now
   (iloprost can resume once extubated).
   # Epistaxis.  Noted to have blood in nose during event.  No current
   bleeding.  Neither OGT or ETT suctioning returning blood.
   -          continue to monitor for now
   -          FFP and platelets is needed if has recurrent bleeding.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of HepC and EtOH cirrhosis who has had four admissions to the ICU this month for altered mental status. He has been intubated each time due to sleep disordered breathing. Currently, he appears to be near his baseline with lactulose therapy, with no concern for acute intracranial pressure or subclinical status. The medical team is considering a tracheostomy given the number of intubations. The patient is being treated for liver failure with lactulose, rifaximin, and Flagyl. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 102/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving propofol infusion and various other medications. His labs show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's neurologic exam is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of HepC and cirrhosis, along with the use of lactulose, suggests the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status or other signs of hepatic encephalopathy is important.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to liver failure and cirrh"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He has had four admissions to the ICU this month for altered mental status, which may be complicated by sleep disordered breathing, leading to intubation each time. The patient's current condition shows improvement with lactulose therapy and there are no concerns for acute hepatic encephalopathy (AHE) or subclinical status at this point. The medical team is considering the merits of a tracheostomy in this patient due to the number of intubations he has had.

The patient is being followed by the liver service and is on lactulose, rifaximin, and Flagyl for clearance. The treatment plan includes continuing the above regimen for liver failure. Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia, which requires attention.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are being managed. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also being provided.

Overall, the patient's current condition is stable, but close monitoring is necessary due to his history of liver failure and multiple ICU admissions. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver failure, development of hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory infections, and potential bleeding disorders."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He has had four previous admissions to the ICU this month for altered mental status, which may be complicated by sleep-disordered breathing leading to intubation each time. Currently, he is back to his baseline.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered Mental Status/Intubation: The patient has improved with lactulose therapy and there is no concern for acute intracranial pressure (AIP) or subclinical status at this point. The team is considering a tracheostomy due to the frequent intubations in the past, which may help with ventilation in the evening.
2. Liver Failure: The patient is being followed by the liver service and is on lactulose, rifaximin, and flagyl for clearance. The same regimen should continue.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is slowly improving over the past 24 hours. It will be continued to trend. His urine osmolarity (Uosm) and fractional excretion of sodium (Fena) are consistent with liver dysfunction.
4. Lactate: The elevated lactate is most likely due to underlying liver dysfunction. It has been oscillating in the past.
5. Elevated White Blood Cell Count/Mild Fever: The elevated WBC count/mild fever appears to be consistent with a stress event. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times this month for altered mental status, possibly complicated by sleep-disordered breathing, leading to intubation each time. Currently, the patient is back to his baseline. 

The patient is being treated with lactulose therapy for altered mental status/intubation, and there are discussions about performing a tracheostomy due to the frequent intubations. He is receiving continuous bolus sedation pending the outcome of the tracheostomy discussion and is on PS ventilation.

For liver failure, the patient is being followed by the liver service and is on lactulose, rifaximin, and Flagyl for clearance. His regimen will continue as above.

The patient's hyponatremia is slowly improving over the past 24 hours, and it will be continued to be trended. His Uosm and Fena were consistent with lactate, which is most likely underlying liver dysfunction. He has had similar oscillations in the past.

The patient's elevated WBC/mild fever appears to be consistent with a stress event as the WBC has improved markedly. If the fever begins to change, we will need to consider paracentesis, although he is on prophylaxis. Notably, his last tap was bland.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is NPO (nothing by"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of HepC and EtOh cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times this month for altered mental status, possibly complicated by sleep disordered breathing. He is currently back to his baseline after receiving lactulose therapy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 151/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and RSBI of 13. The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and high lactate levels. He is being treated with lactulose, rifaximin, and flagyl for clearance. His hyponatremia is slowly improving. The patient has an elevated WBC count, but it has improved. There is a consideration for tracheostomy due to the number of intubations he has had in the past.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times this month for altered mental status, possibly complicated by sleep-disordered breathing, resulting in intubation each time. Currently, he appears to be back to his baseline after receiving lactulose therapy. There are no concerns for acute inflammatory pseudomembranous colitis (AIP) or subclinical status at this point. The medical team is considering a tracheostomy due to the number of previous intubations. The patient is receiving continuous bolus sedation pending the outcome of the tracheostomy discussion and is being ventilated with pressure support ventilation (PSV).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status/Intubation: The patient has improved to near his baseline with lactulose therapy, and there are no concerns for AIP or subclinical status. The team is weighing the merits of tracheostomy given the number of past intubations. Continuous bolus sedation is being provided pending the tracheostomy discussion, and PSV is being used for ventilation, particularly in the evening.
2. Liver Failure: The patient is being followed by the liver service and is on lactulose, rifaximin, and flagyl for clearance. The same regimen should continue.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are slowly"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 41 yo M with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with
   Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism who presents with
   his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection.
   # Somnolence and respiratory failure.  Again prompting respiratory code
   and intubation for airway protection on floor.  Differential has
   included hepatic encephalopathy (worsening overnight with no overnight
   doses of lactulose), OSA or other sleep disordered breathing.  Most
   likely explanation is severe hepatic encephalopathy with overnight
   break from lactulose, as these episodes have all occurred within a few
   hours of 8am meds (no lactulose for at least 8-10 hours).
   -          Treat aggressively for hepatic encephalopathy  - now
   lactulose TID to maintain 4+ BM/day, continue rifaximin and flagyl.
   [**Month (only) 51**] need specific overnight wakeup for lactulose.
   -         Possible OSA
 consider CPAP upon extubation.
   -          Extubation likely today.
   -          Discussion yesterday re: possible trach.  Would clearly be
   beneficial if this process is due to obstructive apnea.  Would also be
   beneficial if central apnea in that could easily be hooked up to vent
   (but ?need to go to vent facility following discharge) as opposed to
   repeated intubations and potential hypoxic exposures.  Will discuss
   with liver team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2249**].
   .
    # Respiratory alkalosis/metabolic acidosis.  Respiratory drive likely
   related to ascites/large abdomen with other hormonal effects from
   cirrhosis.  Also with metabolic acidosis
 may be in part compensatory
   for respiratory alkalosis, but bicarb dropping throughout this
   admission, likely an effect of increasing lactulose requirements
   leading to worsening diarrhea and bicarb losses.
   -          Continue with PSV on vent at current settings ([**4-24**]), plan
   extubate today.
   -          Recheck urinary anion gap (was dry yesterday during check)
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improving.
   -          1 L fluid restriction once taking PO.
   -          Hold diuretics
   .
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   - lactulose, rifaximin, flagyl as above.
   -holding diuretics for now as still appears dry.
   -continue prophylactic cipro (SBP).
   - follow up hepatology recs
   .
    # Pulmonary HTN: on iloprost and sildenifil at home.  Sildenifil
   discontinued on floor due to concern of worsening OSA.  No evidence
   that this or other decompensations were related to pulmonary
   hypertension, as remains hemodynamically stable during these events.
   -          continue to hold both sildenifil and iloprost for now.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  To 18K yesterday, now trending down. ?stress response
   from intubation/resp failure.
   -          f/u c.diff
   -          trend fever curve; defer para given lack of abd pain
   currently.
   .
   # Epistaxis.  Noted to have blood in nose during event.  No current
   bleeding.  Neither OGT or ETT suctioning returning blood.
   -          continue to monitor for now
   -          can restart HSQ.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 41-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism.
- He presents with his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection.
- The patient has been treated aggressively for hepatic encephalopathy, including lactulose TID to maintain 4+ BM/day, rifaximin, and flagyl.
- Possible OSA is also being considered, with the possibility of using CPAP upon extubation.
- Extubation is likely today, and a discussion regarding a possible tracheostomy has been initiated.
- The patient has respiratory alkalosis/metabolic acidosis, possibly related to ascites/large abdomen and hormonal effects from cirrhosis.
- Hyponatremia is improving, and fluid restriction is planned once the patient is taking PO.
- ESLD management includes lactulose, rifaximin, flagyl, holding diuretics, prophylactic cipro (SBP), and follow-up hepatology recommendations.
- Pulmonary HTN management includes continuing iloprost and holding sildenifil.
- Leukocytosis is trending down and may be a stress response from intubation/resp failure.
- The patient had an episode of epistaxis, which is being monitored.
- Hypothyroidism management includes continuing levothyroxine.

The possibility of OSA is being considered, and CPAP may be used upon extubation. Extubation is likely today, and there is ongoing discussion regarding a possible tracheostomy. The liver team and Dr. [Last Name (STitle)] will be involved in this decision.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory alkalosis/metabolic acidosis, possibly related to ascites/large abdomen and hormonal effects from cirrhosis. There is also hyponatremia, which is improving, and ESLD with Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis. Prophylactic cipro (SBP) will continue, along with follow-up hepatology recommendations. Pulmonary HTN"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 41 yo M with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with
   Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism who presents with
   his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection.
   # Somnolence and respiratory failure.  Respiratory code and intubation
   for airway protection now x 4 on floor.  Differential has included
   hepatic encephalopathy (worsening overnight with no overnight doses of
   lactulose), OSA or other sleep disordered breathing.  episodes have all
   occurred within a few hours of 8am meds (no lactulose for at least [**7-30**]
   hours).
   -          lactulose TID to maintain 4+ BM/day, continue rifaximin and
   flagyl.  [**Month (only) 51**] need specific overnight wakeup for lactulose.
   -         Possible OSA
 continue nighttime CPAP (tolerating well thus
   far).
   -          Discussion continues re: possible trach.  Would clearly be
   beneficial if this process is due to obstructive apnea (though unclear
   if this is the cause).  Would also be beneficial if central apnea in
   that could easily be hooked up to vent (but weighing risks, ?need to go
   to vent facility following discharge, increased risk of
   infections/VAPs) as opposed to repeated intubations and potential
   hypoxic exposures.  Will continue to follow discussions.
   .
    # Metabolic acidosis.  may be in part compensatory for respiratory
   alkalosis (hyperventilatory with liver failure and ascites), but bicarb
   dropping throughout this admission, likely an effect of increasing
   lactulose requirements leading to worsening diarrhea and bicarb losses.
   .
   # Gram positive cocci in ascitic fluid.  ?contaminant.  From tap [**11-6**],
   did not grow until [**11-10**].  70 WBCs with 7% PMNs, not consistent with
   SBP/infection.
   -          consider re-tap of ascites.
   -          f/u cultures, hold off on vanco for now.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: 1 L fluid restriction.  Restart diuretics.
   .
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   - lactulose, rifaximin, flagyl as above.
   -restart diuretics
   -continue prophylactic cipro (SBP).
   - follow up hepatology recs
   .
    # Pulmonary HTN: on iloprost and sildenifil at home.  Sildenifil
   discontinued on floor due to concern of worsening OSA.  No evidence
   that this or other decompensations were related to pulmonary
   hypertension, as remains hemodynamically stable during these events.
   -          continue to hold sildenifil; restart iloprost..

   Present for key portions of history and physical exam. Agree with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3439**]
s assessment and plan. Repeated intubations for obtundation
   without structural lesions. Presumably events reflecting a combination
   of hepatic encephalopathy and OSA, as well as hyponatremia.  No
   evidence of acute intrinsic lung disease and sleep apnea is only mild.
   Strongly doubt a trache would be of help and would be very reluctant to
   intubate in the future for
airway protection
.  Agree with need for
   aggressive management of metabolic causes of altered MS.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 41-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension, end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list due to Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis, as well as hypothyroidism. He presents with his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, somnolence, hepatic encephalopathy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), metabolic acidosis, gram-positive cocci in ascitic fluid (possibly a contaminant), hyponatremia, ESLD, and pulmonary hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and OSA, there is a risk of recurrent episodes of hypoxia and respiratory arrest.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can worsen, leading to further alterations in mental status and potential complications such as infections or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Infections: The presence of gram-positive cocci in the ascitic fluid suggests a potential infection, which may progress to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) if not appropriately managed.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hyponatremia requires careful management to prevent neurological complications.
5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's condition may progress, leading to further complications such as right heart failure or pulmonary edema.
6. ESLD complications: The patient's liver dysfunction"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 41-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension, end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list with Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism. He presents with his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and his current vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 121/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently extubated and tolerating CPAP well. 

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, icteric sclera, diminished breath sounds at the bases, and 1+ edema in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin, and abnormal kidney function tests. 

The patient's medical conditions include pulmonary hypertension, ESLD with Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's ESLD with Hep C cirrhosis puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), and alcoholic cirrhosis. He presents with his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, somnolence, and metabolic acidosis. He also has hyponatremia, which has been managed with fluid restriction and diuretics. Gram-positive cocci were found in the ascitic fluid, but it is considered a contaminant. The patient is on prophylactic antibiotics for potential spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). His current medications include lactulose, rifaximin, flagyl, and diuretics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if he does not tolerate CPAP or if he develops further episodes of airway obstruction.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy may continue to worsen without proper management of lactulose dosing and monitoring of ammonia levels.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may progress due to worsening diarrhea and bicarbonate losses from increased lactulose requirements.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may not improve without adherence to fluid restriction and restart of diuretics.
5. Potential Infection: Although the presence of"

He was intubated each time and is currently back to baseline, tolerating CPAP well. The patient's altered mental status has improved with lactulose therapy, and there is no concern for acute hepatic encephalopathy or subclinical status at this point. 

The patient is being followed by the liver service on lactulose, rifaximin, and flagyl for clearance. The supportive CPAP therapy at night is being continued. 

The patient has hyponatremia that is slowly improving over the past 24 hours, with trends consistent with SIADH. His WBC count was elevated but appears to be consistent with a stress event, as it has improved markedly. If the WBC count changes, paracentesis may be considered, although the last tap was bland and growing coag neg staph. c. diff was negative. 

The patient's low HCO3 levels were likely due to the lactulose regimen, but the values have stabilized for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times this month for altered mental status, which may be complicated by sleep disordered breathing. Currently, he is back to his baseline and has tolerated CPAP well without any episodes of morning altered mental status.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status/Intubation: The patient has improved to near his baseline with lactulose therapy, and there is no concern for Acute Intrahepatic Portal hypertension (AIP) or subclinical status at this point. Supportive CPAP will be continued at night.
2. Liver Failure: The patient is being followed by the liver service and is on lactulose, rifaximin, and flagyl for clearance. The current regimen will be continued, and the diuretic regimen will be added back. Consideration will be given to a Vitamin K trial if the INR remains elevated.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are slowly improving over the past 24 hours, and will continue to be trended. His Uosm and Fena were consistent with Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH).
4. Elevated White Blood Cell Count/Mild Fever: The elevated WBC count appears to be consistent with a stress response. The WBC count has improved markedly,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of HepC and EtOh cirrhosis, who has had four admissions to the ICU this month for altered mental status possibly complicated by sleep disordered breathing. He is currently back to his baseline and being treated with lactulose therapy. The medical team is considering the merits of a tracheostomy due to the number of intubations he has had. The patient is also being followed by the liver service and is on lactulose, rifax, and flagy for clearance. His hyponatremia is slowly improving, and his elevated WBC/mild fever is consistent with a stress event. The patient is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP, and is scheduled for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reintubation: Given the patient's history of multiple intubations, there is a potential risk of reintubation if his respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver failure. This condition can lead to confusion, disorientation, and even coma if not managed properly.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC and mild fever indicate a possible infection. If left untreated, it could progress to a more severe infection such as sepsis.
4. Hepatic hydrothorax: As"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo M with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with Hep C
   cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism who presents with his
   fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway
   protection.
   # Somnolence and respiratory failure.  Respiratory code and intubation
   for airway protection now x4 on floor.  DDX: hepatic encephalopathy,
   OSA or other sleep disordered breathing.
   - lactulose TID to maintain 4+ BM/day, rifaximin and flagyl-
   - possible OSA
 continue nighttime CPAP (tolerating well thus far).
   - discussion continues re: possible trach.  Would clearly be beneficial
   if this process is due to obstructive apnea (though unclear if this is
   the cause).  Would also be beneficial if central apnea in that could
   easily be hooked up to vent (but weighing risks, ?need to go to vent
   facility following discharge, increased risk of infections/VAPs) as
   opposed to repeated intubations and potential hypoxic exposures.  Will
   continue to follow discussions.
   .
    # Metabolic acidosis.  may be in part compensatory for respiratory
   alkalosis (hyperventilatory with liver failure and ascites), but bicarb
   dropping throughout this admission, likely an effect of increasing
   lactulose requirements leading to worsening diarrhea and bicarb losses.
   .
   # Gram positive cocci in ascitic fluid.  ?contaminant.  From tap [**11-6**],
   did not grow until [**11-10**].  70 WBCs with 7% PMNs, not consistent with
   SBP/infection.
   - consider re-tap of ascites.
   - f/u cultures, hold off on vanco for now.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: 1 L fluid restriction.  Restart diuretics.
   .
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   - lactulose, rifaximin, flagyl as above.
   -restart diuretics
 lasix and spironolactone
   -continue prophylactic cipro (SBP).
   - follow up hepatology recs
   .
    # Pulmonary HTN: on iloprost and sildenifil at home.  Sildenifil
   discontinued on floor due to concern of worsening OSA.  No evidence
   that this or other decompensations were related to pulmonary
   hypertension, as remains hemodynamically stable during these events.
   -          continue to hold sildenifil; restart iloprost..

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), and a history of Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism. He presents with his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient is currently on CPAP for respiratory support and has been tolerating it well. There are ongoing discussions regarding the possibility of a tracheostomy, weighing the risks and benefits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver failure. Lactulose has been prescribed to maintain 4+ bowel movements per day, along with rifaximin and Flagyl.
2. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient may have OSA, which is contributing to his respiratory failure. Nighttime CPAP has been continued, and there is a possibility of a tracheostomy to help manage this condition.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which may be partly compensatory for respiratory alkalosis. It is likely due to worsening diarrhea and bicarbonate losses from increased lactulose requirements.
4. Gram-Positive Cocci in Ascitic Fluid: There are gram-positive cocci present in the ascitic fluid, although it is unclear if this is a contaminant or indicative"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo M with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with Hep C
   cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism who presents with his
   fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway
   protection.
   # Somnolence and respiratory failure.  Respiratory code and intubation
   for airway protection now x4 on floor.  DDX: hepatic encephalopathy,
   OSA or other sleep disordered breathing.
   - lactulose TID to maintain 4+ BM/day, rifaximin and flagyl-
   - possible OSA
 continue nighttime CPAP (tolerating well thus far).
   - discussion continues re: possible trach.  Would clearly be beneficial
   if this process is due to obstructive apnea (though unclear if this is
   the cause).  Would also be beneficial if central apnea in that could
   easily be hooked up to vent (but weighing risks, ?need to go to vent
   facility following discharge, increased risk of infections/VAPs) as
   opposed to repeated intubations and potential hypoxic exposures.  Will
   continue to follow discussions.  Plan right now to continue CPAP at
   night with late night or overnight lactulose; if requires repeat
   intubation with this regimen, will likely need trach.
   .
    # Metabolic acidosis.  may be in part compensatory for respiratory
   alkalosis (hyperventilatory with liver failure and ascites), but bicarb
   dropping throughout this admission, likely an effect of increasing
   lactulose requirements leading to worsening diarrhea and bicarb
   losses.  Continue to follow daily.
   .
   # Staph coag neg in ascitic fluid.  ?contaminant.  From tap [**11-6**], did
   not grow until [**11-10**].  70 WBCs with 7% PMNs, not consistent with
   SBP/infection.  Likely contaminant, not treating.  If fever or
   abdominal pain, will need repeat tap.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Significantly improved.  With this improvement and
   slight bump in creatinine, will liberalize to 2 L restriction.
   .
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   - lactulose, rifaximin, flagyl as above.
   -lasix and spironolactone, can further titrate on the floor.
   -continue prophylactic cipro (SBP).
   - follow up hepatology recs
   .
    # Pulmonary HTN: on iloprost and sildenifil at home.  Sildenifil
   discontinued on floor due to concern of worsening OSA.  No evidence
   that this or other decompensations were related to pulmonary
   hypertension, as remains hemodynamically stable during these events.
   -          continue sildenifil and iloprost (restarted over weekend).

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), and a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. He presents with his fourth episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with somnolence and respiratory failure. Possible diagnoses include hepatic encephalopathy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or other sleep-disordered breathing.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of altered mental status, leading to airway protection through intubation.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's ESLD and Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy is a possible complication, which may contribute to altered mental status.
4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): OSA is suspected as a potential cause of the patient's respiratory failure and altered mental status. Nighttime CPAP is being used, but the possibility of a tracheostomy is being considered.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely due to worsening diarrhea caused by lactulose treatment and bicarbonate losses.
6. Infection: The presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the ascitic fluid raises concern for intra-abdominal infection"
