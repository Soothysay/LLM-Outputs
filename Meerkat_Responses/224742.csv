","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to influenza. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. His blood work indicates an elevated white blood cell count, elevated D-dimer, and bandemia. The patient also has evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray and crackles in both lung fields. He has been started on Tamiflu for influenza and antibiotics for concern of bacterial superinfection. The patient is also on aspirin and statin due to a troponin bump and lateral wall depressions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is further lung involvement or if the mechanical ventilation settings need to be adjusted.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated fever, bandemia, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis. This could be a result of the viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial infection.
3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of organ dysfunction, as indicated by the elevated D-dimer and abnormal lab values. This could potentially progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may require further management and anticoagulation.
5. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, and his crackles"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to influenza. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with viral pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. He has been off pressors. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, increased bandemia, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient's troponin levels are elevated with lateral wall depressions, suggestive of demand ischemia. He also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient is on several medications including aspirin, statin, vancomycin, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to viral pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bandemia, fever, and hypotension suggest severe sepsis. It is important to promptly identify and treat any bacterial superinfections.
3. Demand Ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin levels with lateral wall depressions indicate demand ischemia. Continued monitoring and management of cardiac function are crucial.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's episodes of rapid ventricular response in the setting of atrial fibrillation need to be managed carefully to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to influenza. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues including severe sepsis, viral pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, demand ischemia, and chronic systolic heart failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to influenza, which may worsen if ventilator settings need to be adjusted or if there are complications with weaning off the ventilator.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with signs of systemic inflammation, such as fever, bandemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. This could progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has viral pneumonia, and there is a concern for bacterial superinfection given the presence of pus in the left lower lobe on bronchoscopy. Antibiotic coverage should be continued to prevent or treat any bacterial infection.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has ongoing episodes of rapid ventricular response in the setting of atrial fibrillation. This increases the risk of hemodynamic instability and thromboembolic events.
5. Ischemia: The patient had a troponin bump with lateral wall depressions, indicating myocardial ischemia. This could be related to sepsis or underlying"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Oxygenating adequately with good RSBI this AM, wean PSV as tolerated
   ?exubate today
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   Bandemia improved, afebrile
   Continue oseltamivir for influenza currently day 3
   Pt. had pus from LLL on [**2-5**] bronch so continue levofloxacin for
   ?bacterial superinfection. Consider d/c vancomycin.
   Followup cultures and reculture if febrile
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Off of pressors, making adequate urine. Hypotensive yesterday in
   setting of ativan, now with improved BP. Continue antibiotics as above.
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   Enzymes elevated yesterday in setting of RVR, suspect demand ischemia.
   CK
s trending down with flat tropn, continue to trend. Continue medical
   management with aspirin, statin, beta blocker; will titrate beta
   blocker upward for further rate control today.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Still tachycardic, increase metoprolol. Holding anticoagulation [**1-30**]
   supratherapeutic INR. Will restart heparin drip when INR <2.
 INR elevated
   Patient on coumadin at home, held here. No evidence of active bleeding
   with stable Hct. Consider PO vitamin K.
   Will repeat DIC labs.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   Clinically ~euvolemic, goal net even today. Consider checking TTE to
   assess pump function (no echo on file here)

","The patient is an elderly male with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and Alzheimer's disease. He was admitted with influenza symptoms. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, pneumonia (viral), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, elevated INR, chronic systolic heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. These conditions are being managed with various treatments such as antibiotics, antiviral medication, aspirin, statins, beta blockers, and other supportive care measures.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, normal hemoglobin levels, and elevated troponin levels. Imaging studies reveal an opacity in the lower left lung field, suggestive of a lung infection or effusion.

The patient's overall condition is stable, with ongoing management of his respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure."

   latest troponin 0.13, no significant change in EKG - on beta-blocker
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Lopressor, systemically anticoagulated
 COAGULOPATHY: await fibrinogen (DSPs are improved and no schistos so

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): try PSV and see if he can
   tolerate NAG acidosis from a work of breathing standpoint, extubate if
   he can do this (will wean sedation first)
 PNEUMONIA: Influenza and possible superinfection - on Tamiflu and can
   d/c Vancomycin given no MRSA or GP orgs, finish course of Levaquin
   (bands gone and WBC improving)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): resolved, abx as above
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   latest troponin 0.13, no significant change in EKG - on beta-blocker
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Lopressor, systemically anticoagulated
 COAGULOPATHY: await fibrinogen (DSPs are improved and no schistos so
   likely not in DIC) so suspect coumadin use explains - will give 5mg
   vitamin K and f/u labs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is anticoagulated. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a medical history. He has been treated for pneumonia, sepsis, and myocardial infarction. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and increased Cl and NAG acidosis. The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, lorazepam, metoprolol, and antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of fever and infiltrates on imaging.
3. Sepsis, given the patient's history of infection and organ dysfunction.
4. Myocardial infarction, with ongoing chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, potentially leading to hemodynamic instability.
6. Coagulopathy, suggested by the elevated PT/INR and risk of bleeding.
7. Complications related to mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
8. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and risk factors.
9. Stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding from prolonged ICU stay and medication use.
10. Vitamin K deficiency leading to abnormal coag"

   Disposition:ICU until extubated
","The patient is an elderly thin frail individual who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been stable with good oxygenation but poor mental status. They continue to have mod-copious thick secretions requiring frequent suctioning, so extubation has been held off for now.

The patient has pneumonia, viral in nature, and is currently being treated with oseltamivir for influenza. They were previously on levofloxacin for a possible bacterial superinfection, but all cultures showed no growth, so the medication has been discontinued.

The patient also has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of hypotension prior to intubation. They are currently off of pressors and making adequate urine. Antibiotics have been discontinued.

The patient is also experiencing demand ischemia likely from atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of hypotension. Troponins remain elevated, consistent with an ischemic episode. Medical management with aspirin, statin, and beta blocker has been initiated, and the beta blocker will be titrated upward for further rate control today.

The patient continues to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and anticoagulation has been held due to a supratherapeutic INR. Vitamin K has been given, and coags will be trended daily.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, with no evidence"

","Summary:
The patient is a thin, frail elderly individual admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, pneumonia, severe sepsis, altered mental status, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient's condition has been stable since admission, with no gross bleeding despite an elevated INR. They have been weaned off sedation but continue to have depressed mental status responsive only to sternal rub. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/85 to 101/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with an irregularly irregular rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,903 mL and output of 815 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, famotidine, and insulin for glycemic control. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.5 x 10^9/L, slightly decreased hemoglobin at 11.4 g/dL, elevated troponin T levels, and mildly elevated lactate levels. Imaging reveals increased left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis, small bilateral pleural effusions, and mild diffuse interstitial opacities. Microbiology results are negative for any significant pathogens in the bron"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with Alzheimer
s Disease, Afib admitted for respiratory failure
   [**1-30**] influenza, intubated but off pressors.
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Unable to wean off vent yesterday due to
   depressed MS-responsive only to sternal rub even when off sedation.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have some element of pulmonary edema given worsening CXR and
   aggressive fluids on admission
   -RSBI of 38, requiring suctioning q1 hr, fluid is frothy
   -ABG 7.41/32/154
   -despite adequate RSBI and ABG, extubation unlikely to be successful at
   this time
   -would continue to wean sedation
   -monitor UOP
   -am CXR
   2.  Pneumonia:  DFA positive for influenza B, on Tamiflu.  Bronchoscopy
   showed pus in LLL, bronchial washings with 6000/ml MSSA.  Vacnomycin
   d/c'ed yesterday.  WBC 9.4 bandemia resolved.
   -continue Tamiflu
   -D/c levofloxacin and start Nafcillin for possible MSSA PNA
   superinfection
   3. Sepsis:  Off pressors >24h, UOP reduced this morning, CVP 12.  SBP
   drop yesterday to 80's, fluid responsive.  Current bp's 125/87,
   tachycardic
   -abx as above
   -monitor bp's closely as diuresing
   -fluid bolus if drops SB tp 80's
   4.  Elevated Troponin:  Mild elevation at 0.17 now, slight bump from
   previous.  Likely demand ischemia vs MI.  Currently medical management.
   -Continue on ASA, statin, b-block
   -will start heparin sq now that INR therapeutic at 2.2
   -continue to hold coumadin
   5.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Tachycardic on metoprolol 12.5mg tid, SBP's
   in 120's.
   -increase to metoprolol 25mg po tid for better rate control
   -monitor bp's especially in setting of diuresis
   -start heparin sq [**Hospital1 **] for anticoagulation
   6.  Elevated INR:  Now 2.2 off coumadin, no signs of active bleeding.
   -continue to hold coumadin
   -anti-coagulation as above
   7.  History of heart failure:  Unclear of diagnosis, no echo on
   record.  Clinically mild volume ovreload with worsened CXR and frothy
   secretions.
   -Echo to evaluate
   **********PGY1 addendum************
   Agree with above MS4 note, will diurese to goal -1 liter today as CXr
   with worsening pulmonary edema, will obtain echo to better characterize
   for pump function.  Will maintain on vent for now given thick
   secretions and ongoing pulmonary processes (influenza and MSSA
   superinfection). Add nafcillin for MSSA coverage (day 1 = [**2-8**]), can
   d/c levofloxacin. Continue oseltamivir day [**4-3**]. Uptitrate BB for better
   rate control for Afib. As we are holding coumadin and pt
s INR now
   dropping s/p vitamin K, will begin heparin gtt. Continue medical
   management of CAD.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with Alzheimer's disease who was admitted for respiratory failure due to influenza. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical conditions include pneumonia, sepsis, elevated troponin levels, atrial fibrillation, and a history of heart failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has persistent atelectasis in the left lower lobe and pleural effusions. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, antiviral medication, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator suggests ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to the presence of pulmonary edema, worsening atelectasis, or an underlying lung infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has DFA positive for influenza B and bronchoscopic findings of pus in the left lower lobe, indicating a possible bacterial superinfection. MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) has been identified, and the patient is being treated with nafcillin.
3. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with sepsis is improving, as evidenced by being off pressors for more than 24 hours, reduced urine output, and a stable central venous pressure (CVP). However, close monitoring of blood pressures and fluid status is necessary.
4. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old man with respiratory failure secondary to influenza pneumonia, possibly with Staphylococcal superinfection. The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is already compromised due to influenza pneumonia and potential Staphylococcal superinfection. This condition can worsen, leading to further respiratory distress or failure.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient may have a component of pulmonary edema on top of other problems. If left untreated, pulmonary edema can progress and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, likely due to the Staphylococcal superinfection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially result in multiple organ failure.

4. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as sedation, sepsis, or another underlying condition. This could progress to delirium or worsening cognitive impairment.

5. Myocardial infarction: The patient is also at risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), possibly due to the stress of the infection, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, or direct involvement of the myocardium by the infection.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to influenza pneumonia, likely with Staphylococcal superinfection. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), suspected pulmonary edema, pneumonia (viral influenza, now likely with Staphylococcal superinfection), severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), altered mental status (not delirium), acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation, chronic systolic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which is likely due to influenza pneumonia and potential Staphylococcal superinfection. Complications may arise if the patient's condition worsens or if there is a delay in treating the underlying infection.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient may have a component of pulmonary edema on top of other problems. If left untreated, pulmonary edema can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially worsen the patient's respiratory failure.

3. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure if not promptly and effectively managed.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which can be a result of various factors including sedation, sepsis, or underlying medical conditions. This"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Chest film still with some pulmonary edema, but maintaining adequate
   oxygenation. Continued secretions and depressed mental status may limit
   extubation. Trial of scopolamine patch, repeat ABG in afternoon,
   ?extubation tomorrow.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC and Hypotension
   Patient became hypotensive during rounds in setting of diuresis and
   sedative bolus, uncertain which was primarily responsible. CVP low c/w
   intravascularly dry state. Responded to 250cc NS bolus. Will hold off
   on further diuresis today as patient is nearly 2 liters negative at
   time of this note. Give additional IVF if required to maintain MAP>65.
   Svo2 ~nl at 73 arguing against severely impaired forward flow as cause
   of his hypotension.
   TTE yesterday showed significantly impaired EF
 no prior study
   available for comparison. Decrease may be [**1-30**] influenza-related
   cardiomyopathy versus ischemic insult.  ?Whether decreased from prior
   per discussion with wife, would be helpful to obtain outside records
   for comparison. Continue change to carvelilol with low dose ACEI once
   BP stable. Replete K>4, Magnesium>2
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   Continue oseltamivir x5 day course
   Covering MSSA from BAL with nafcillin, unclear if this sparse isolate
   is significant but patient at risk for staph pneumonia so will treat

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Rate controlled with metoprolol, on IV heparin for anticoagulation.
   Developed RVR with lifting of sedation this AM may need additional beta
   blockade near time of extubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with dementia who was admitted to the ICU for influenza. The patient has been diuresed well, but continues to require frequent suctioning every 1-2 hours. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15-20%, which is significantly decreased from his previous level of 60%. The patient has also been sedated and unable to provide a medical history.

The patient is currently on several medications, including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Nafcillin, Heparin Sodium, Furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. He is also receiving tube feeds for nutrition and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/57 mmHg to 147/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has atrial fibrillation with a controlled heart rate and is on IV heparin for anticoagulation.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 655 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 41. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 353 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, warm skin, and soft, non-tender abdomen. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be sedated and unresponsive.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 32.2%, and platelet count (Plt) of 128. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to ongoing secretions and depressed mental status, which may limit extubation. Chest film still shows some pulmonary edema, but the patient is maintaining adequate oxygenation. The respiratory support plan includes maintaining CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator and monitoring RSBI.

2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. Hypotension during rounds may be related to diuresis and sedative bolus. CVP is low, indicating intravascular volume depletion. The patient responded to a normal saline bolus and will have further diuresis held today. Additional IV fluids will be given"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with dementia admitted to the ICU with influenza. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, chronic systolic heart failure, pneumonia (viral), atrial fibrillation, severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), altered mental status, and possible acute myocardial infarction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient continues to require frequent suctioning and has borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. These findings suggest a risk for worsening respiratory failure.

2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with significantly impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. There is mild mitral regurgitation and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. These findings indicate a potential risk for exacerbation of heart failure.

3. Infection: The patient has pneumonia (viral) and is being treated with oseltamivir. Additionally, there is coverage for MSSA with nafcillin due to a sparse isolate from bronchoalveolar lavage. This suggests a risk for ongoing or recurrent infections.

4. Sepsis: Although the patient's blood pressure is stable off pressors, and urine output is excellent, the presence of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction indicates a risk for further deterioration.

5. Myocardial infarction: The patient has been evaluated for acute myocardial infarction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old thin elderly male who is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including respiratory failure, acute heart failure, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, sepsis, altered mental status, and myocardial infarction.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 104 bpm with an irregularly irregular rhythm indicating atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 139/80 to 162/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 520 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and nafcillin, as well as other medications such as metoprolol, midazolam, and fentanyl. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and slightly elevated troponin levels. Chest X-rays show moderate bilateral pleural effusions, borderline interstitial pulmonary edema, and opacification at the medial aspect of the left lung base, which is likely residual atelectasis.

","The patient is a 68-year-old elderly male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and has a history of chronic heart failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 139/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Upon reviewing the patient's labs, there are several notable findings. His white blood cell count is elevated at 223 K/uL, indicating an infection. His hemoglobin level is low at 11.0 g/dL, suggesting anemia. His sodium level is within normal range at 154 mg/dL, while his potassium level is slightly elevated at 0.8 mg/dL. His creatinine level is normal at 0.7 mg/dL, but his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is high at 27 mEq/L. His troponin-T level is slightly elevated at 0.17 ng/mL, indicating possible myocardial injury.

The patient has undergone several imaging studies, including a chest X-ray which shows moderate bilateral pleural effusions, borderline interstitial pulmonary ed"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to influenza with a Staphylococcal superinfection. He has multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, sepsis, altered mental status, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and acute heart failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and receiving various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which can worsen if his lung function deteriorates further or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has viral pneumonia caused by influenza. It can progress to a bacterial infection or develop complications like abscess formation.
3. Sepsis: The patient has had severe sepsis, which has since resolved. There is a risk of recurrence if the infection spreads or if there is another systemic response to an insult.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and he is not following commands. This could be due to various factors such as sedation, infection, or hypoxic damage. Monitoring for any changes in his level of consciousness is crucial.
5. Myocardial Infarction: Although the patient's troponin levels are within normal range, the possibility of myocardial infarction should be closely monitored, especially considering his age and comorbidities.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may lead to complications like stroke if not properly managed.
7. Heart Failure: The patient has acute heart failure, and his condition should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration.
8. Line Infections: The patient has multiple lines and tubes, which can increase the risk of infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylaxis measures are in place, but the patient should be monitored for symptoms of DVT or pulmonary embolism.

Please note that this summary and list of potential complications are based on the provided information. Clinical judgment and ongoing monitoring are necessary to identify additional risks and manage the patient's condition effectively."

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/66 mmHg to 149/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, and abnormal cardiac enzymes. Imaging reveals an abnormal chest X-ray with left basilar lucency. The patient is being treated with various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be minimized through proper oral hygiene, elevation of the head of bed, and regular assessment of respiratory secretions.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood cl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia caused by influenza and MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus). The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure, severe sepsis (which has resolved), altered mental status (possibly due to underlying dementia or sedation), metabolic alkalosis (caused by volume contraction during diuresis), demand ischemia (resolved), and atrial fibrillation. The patient was previously intubated and receiving invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an ongoing infection due to influenza and MSSA. This increases the risk of worsening respiratory symptoms and potential complications such as sepsis or organ dysfunction.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema if not managed properly.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to underlying dementia or residual effects of sedation. This increases the risk of falls, difficulty with mobility, and potential complications related to poor cognitive function.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may require careful monitoring and management to avoid complications like arrhythmias or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Demand Ischemia: Although the demand ischemia has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent ischemic events if the underlying coronary"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of chronic systolic heart failure, known underlying dementia, and recent hospital admission for sepsis and pneumonia. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure but has now been successfully extubated. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/76 to 136/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on continuous heparin infusion and receiving medications such as metoprolol and lasix. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's flow sheet data indicates stable hemodynamics with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 3 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,908 mL and output of 1,720 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 188 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 364 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) at 31.1%, elevated platelet count (Plt) at 364 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) at 0.9 mg/dL, and slightly low potassium (K+) level at 3.7 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including viral pneumonia, chronic systolic heart failure, severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), altered mental status (likely due to underlying dementia and/or sedation), and atrial fibrillation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure due to fluid overload or inadequate diuresis, progression of sepsis or development of new infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration in mental status, and potential arrhythmias related to atrial fibrillation. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels while providing appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care for heart failure and sepsis."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old man who was admitted due to respiratory failure caused by influenza with a Staphylococcal superinfection. He has undergone invasive ventilation and was successfully extubated. The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, chronic systolic heart failure, altered mental status, and a history of acute myocardial infarction. He also has atrial fibrillation, for which he is being treated with metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial condition was respiratory failure, which can be a life-threatening complication if not properly managed. Since the patient has recently been extubated, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has viral pneumonia due to influenza. This can lead to further respiratory complications and may require additional interventions such as antibiotics or bronchodilators.

3. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which increases his risk for fluid overload and cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of his cardiac function and fluid balance is essential.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be indicative of delirium. Delirium can lead to complications such as falls, respiratory compromise, and increased risk of pressure ulcers.

5. Acute Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction, and there is a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old man one-day s/p extubation, following respiratory failure
   from influenza with Staphylococcal superinfection.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE s/p extubation
   -- doing well on shovel mask
   -- try nasal cannula
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   Influenza
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   -- ACEI
   -- metoprolol for AFib rate control
   -- CVP argues that his ventricular filling pressures are relatively low
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   -- this is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] a bit and may represent delirium
   -- if this doesn't improve, will need further evaluation with CT to
   exclude ICH (given heparin)
 No enteral access
   -- and unable to swallow
   -- place NG tube after heparin off for a couple of hours
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   latest troponin 0.13, no significant change in EKG
   -- ASA, beta blocker, statin, heparin
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -- increase metoprolol
   He still remains tenuous and needs to be watched for at least a few
   more hours in a critical care setting given the intersection of
   severely altered mental status and just-extubated-yesterday respiratory
   failure.

","The patient is a 79-year-old man who was admitted due to respiratory failure from influenza with a Staphylococcal superinfection. He underwent extubation and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and a slightly elevated temperature. His blood pressure is within normal range. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on medication for rate control.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. His kidney function appears to be normal, and electrolyte levels are also within normal range. The cardiac markers show a slightly elevated troponin level, but no significant changes in the EKG.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin appearance, normal breath sounds, and irregular heart rhythm. Neurological examination shows intermittent response to commands and possible myoclonic movements.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure post-extubation, pneumonia (viral influenza), chronic systolic heart failure, altered mental status (possibly delirium), and a recent myocardial infarction (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI). He also has atrial fibrillation and requires rate control.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progression of heart failure, further decline in mental status, and potential clot formation due to prolonged immobilization and systemic anticoag"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a thin, elderly, frail individual with frequent myoclonic jerking. They have been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Influenza and MSSA, leukocytosis, chronic systolic heart failure, severe sepsis (resolved), altered mental status, metabolic alkalosis, demand ischemia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 106/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin, metoprolol, and pantoprazole. They are currently on face tent for secretions only and have an arterial line and two peripheral IV lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection of pneumonia caused by Influenza and MSSA. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of sepsis, and potential respiratory failure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response or infection. This may increase the risk of complications related to the underlying infection.
3. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.

- The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, lactic acid, and D-dimer levels, as well as low albumin and calcium levels.
- Imaging results indicate no evidence of mass, mass effect, or large acute territorial infarct, but there are acute/subacute ischemic changes that cannot be completely excluded.
- The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, leukocytosis, fever, pneumonia (viral and MSSA), heart failure (chronic), metabolic alkalosis, demand ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and possible body dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions.
2. Leukocytosis and fever: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and fever, indicating a possible infection.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by viral and MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infections.
4. Heart failure: The patient has chronic heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload and respiratory complications.
5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which can be caused by diuretic use, vomiting, or respiratory alkalosis.
6. Demand ischemia: The patient experienced demand ischemia, which is reduced blood flow to the heart during periods of increased demand such as exercise or stress.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.
8. Body dementia: The patient's myoclonic jerking and altered mental status may indicate body dementia rather than Alzheimer's disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old man admitted with respiratory failure from influenza with
   Staphylococcal superinfection.  He has now tolerated extubation for >
   24 hours.  Main issues today are his persistent depressed mental status
   and inability to tolerate tube feeding.  He may also have a LLL
   pneumonia.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Does not appear to be sedation-related. I doubt bacterial meningitis.
   Although I suspect it is simply toxic/metabolic, especially given his
   abnormal motion, he seems to favor his left side.  We will consult
   neurology for advice on further evaluation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure from influenza with Staphylococcal superinfection. He has tolerated extubation for more than 24 hours but has persistent depressed mental status and an inability to tolerate tube feeding. The patient may also have left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient may develop worsening respiratory symptoms and increased leukocytosis, which could indicate a possible LLL pneumonia due to aspiration.
2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's condition could progress to systolic and diastolic heart failure due to his underlying cardiac issues and fluid imbalances.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may deteriorate further, potentially indicating toxic/metabolic encephalopathy or bacterial meningitis. Neurological consultation has been sought for further evaluation.
4. Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient's cardiac condition could worsen, leading to an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's AFIB may persist or worsen, requiring ongoing management and possible conversion to normal sinus rhythm using oral lopressor.
6. Intestinal Issues: Feculent material via NG tube suggests the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation. Further evaluation, including imaging, is warranted.

He presented with myoclonus, brown guaiac positive NG tube output, and a CT abdomen showing right-sided pulmonary embolism (PE) bleed. The patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration. He has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/72 mmHg to 90/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,713 mL and output of 1,915 mL, with urine output of 1,765 mL. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 26.3 g/dL, and slightly elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's medical history includes pneumonia, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), acute sepsis (with organ dysfunction), altered mental status (not delirium), and acute myocardial infarction.

   -          autodiuresed yesterday, now with slight bump in creatinine
   although still WNL
   -          would give 500cc bolus now to enhance renal perfusion,goal
   net even today
   -          Continue medical CHF management with ACE-I (change to
   captopril po) and BB (see afib)
 METABOLIC ALKALOSIS - worsening today
   -          could still be contraction alkalosis given impressive
   autodiuresis yesterday
   -          will give IVF today with goal of net even
   -          avoid NGT suction as will cause iatrogenic metabolic
   alkalosis
   -          no obvious medication as etiology
 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   -          now resolved, occurring in setting of hypotension during
   afib with RVR and sepsis from influenza

The patient is currently experiencing altered mental status, myoclonus, leukocytosis, fever, pneumonia (viral and MSSA), chronic heart failure (systolic), metabolic alkalosis, demand ischemia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of underlying dementia and is suspected to have body dementia rather than Alzheimer's disease. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/72 mmHg to 90/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient has received various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and medications for heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,713 mL and output of 1,915 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 798 mL. The patient's NG tube output is 150 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status, along with the presence of fever and leukocytosis, raises concern for delirium. This could be secondary to an underlying infection or other causes.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Has baseline dementia, but below baseline functional status per family.
   Seen by neurology, recommendations appreciated. Recent CT [**2-11**] without
   acute change. Could have had ischemic insult not detected on CT
   however. Agree that seizure is less likely. Could have encephalitis
   related to influenza. TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable.
   --MRI today, will need pre-procedure sedation. Hold off on LP or EEG
   for now.
   --Treat infections as below, provide frequent reorientation
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   Unclear etiology as no h/o recent instrumentation or fall, however
   patient did have quite elevated INR.
   Repeat PM Hct, if falling will consult vascular surgery for further
   evaluation. Holding heparin.
 Abdominal distension
   Has had guiac positive NGT drainage of uncertain etiology.
   No evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen, abdomen benign, follow.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER, suspected VAP
   WBC improved today, no significant fevers. Had grown MSSA from sputum,
   broadened earlier in the week to vancomycin/zosyn/cipro in the setting
   of leukocytosis. Reculture if febrile, follow up cultures.
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   s/p oseltamivir
 Transaminitis
   ALT, AST mildly elevated in setting of elevated CK
 suspect muscle
   source. Could be [**1-30**] influenza, also may be related to myoclonus. Will
   follow CK, urine output. Making adequate amounts of urine today so in
   setting of low EF hold of on additional IVF at this time.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   Continue beta blocker and ACEI, goal net even today
 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   Resolved, continue ASA beta blocker ACEI statin.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Continue rate control, need to titrate up beta blocker further. Holding
   on anticoagulation today in setting of finding of RP hematoma.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:  holding tube feeds prior to MRI will restart subsequently
   Glycemic Control:  continue insulin sliding scale

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who was admitted to the ICU with influenza. He has been experiencing myoclonus, and an MRI has been ordered to investigate further. The patient has brown guaiac positive NG tube output, and a CT abdomen showed a right psoas bleed. Heparin was stopped, and the patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration.

The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, zosyn, vancomycin), aspirin, simvastatin, captopril, metoprolol, and flowsheet data is provided for vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support.

The patient has several medical complications including altered mental status, a retroperitoneal hematoma, abdominal distension, leukocytosis with fever (suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia), viral pneumonia, transaminitis, heart failure (chronic systolic), demand ischemia (resolved), atrial fibrillation, and demand ischemia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit levels, platelet count, creatinine levels, troponin T levels, liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia admitted for influenza. He presented with myoclonus, and neurology evaluation is pending. The patient has brown guaiac positive NG tube output, leading to imaging and further investigation. A CT abdomen revealed a right pulmonary bleed, prompting the cessation of heparin and transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration.

The patient is on multiple antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including ciprofloxacin, zosyn, and vancomycin. He also has a sputum culture growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), for which broader coverage was initiated. 

The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including altered mental status, leukocytosis, fever, heart failure (CHF), metabolic alkalosis, demand ischemia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and potential demand ischemia. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/72 mmHg to 90/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and"

 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   Influenza, with staph superinfection.  Respiratory failure improved,
   now on room air.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:  Likely secondary
   to influenza (as had normal EF before).  Continue beta-blocker,
   ace-inhibitor.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):  His hypotension resolved
   but he had new leukocytosis yesterday, now improved after starting
   treatment for HCAP.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**1-30**] sedation.  Will attempt MRI although he may not tolerate it.  Will
   hold on LP as infectious CNS process seems unlikely.  Will need
   stabilization of metabolic derangements and, if technically possible,
   will pursue MRI
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI):  Likely demand in
   setting of sepsis.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Poorly rate controlled.  Increase
   metoprolol.  No anticoagulation given RP bleed.
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED:  Appears to be spontaneous in setting of
   anticoagulation.  Holding anticoagulation, Hct stable, BP stable.  Will
   follow serial Hct, abd exam.  If it drops, would call vascular.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   the cause of his fevers.
 INCREASED TRANSAMINASES:  Unclear cause of this, but trending down
   since yesterday.  No clear gallbladder pathology on CT scan.  Should
   not be irritation of liver capsule as hematoma is on the left.  Will
   continue to monitor.  If it increases, will get RUQ u/s to look for
   acalculous cholecystitis.  Will check CK in case this is muscle source.

","The patient is an elderly male with a history of influenza, respiratory failure, sepsis, heart failure, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and a retroperitoneal bleed. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of viral influenza and subsequent respiratory failure. There is a possibility of developing pneumonia, especially considering his compromised respiratory function.

2. Myocardial Infarction (heart attack): Given the patient's recent respiratory failure and sepsis, there is an increased risk of myocardial infarction due to the high stress on the cardiovascular system.

3. Stroke: With the patient's altered mental status, atrial fibrillation (poorly rate-controlled), and history of sepsis, there is a risk of developing a stroke due to the potential formation of blood clots.

4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's increased transaminases may indicate liver dysfunction. Further monitoring and evaluation are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters, there is a risk of developing DVTs, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.

6. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels may suggest AKI. Close monitoring of renal function"

   not be irritation of liver capsule as hematoma is on the left.  Will
   continue to monitor.  If it increases, will get RUQ u/s to look for
   acalculous cholecystitis.  Will check CK in case this is muscle source.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male who was admitted with respiratory failure, likely secondary to influenza with a subsequent staphylococcal superinfection. He has had multiple medical complications including heart failure, sepsis, altered mental status, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, retroperitoneal bleed, and increased transaminases. The patient's condition has been improving, but he continues to experience delirium and has a new presentation of retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's current medications include nafcillin, vancomycin, piperacillin, lorazepam, insulin, colace, aspirin, simvastatin, pantoprazole, metoprolol, and captopril.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has acute systolic and diastolic heart failure likely secondary to influenza. It is important to continue beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor therapy.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, there is evidence of leukocytosis indicating an ongoing infectious process. Treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) has been started, which should help improve the sepsis.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing delirium, possibly due to sedation. An attempt will be made to perform an MRI to evaluate for any infectious or other causes, although the patient may not tolerate it.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) - Has baseline dementia, but
   below baseline functional status per family
   - Seen by neurology, recommendations appreciated.
   - Recent CT [**2-11**] without acute change, unable to tolerate MRI
   - seizure is less likely. Could have encephalitis related to influenza.
   - TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable, so toxic metabolic
   unlikely
   - await EEG
   - treat infections as below
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          Transfuse 1 units PRBCs today, [**Male First Name (un) 482**] with 20mg IV lasix
   -          check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -          holding all heparin
 Abdominal distension
   -          No evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen
   -          abdomen benign, follow serial exams.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER - suspected VAP
   -          WBC improved today, low grade fevers.
   -          Had grown MSSA from sputum, broadened earlier in the week to
   vanc/zosyn/cipro in the setting of witnessed apsiration and progressive
   leukocytosis.
   -          Check CXR today
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   -          s/p oseltamivir
 Transaminitis
   ALT, AST mildly elevated in setting of elevated CK
 suspect muscle
   source. Could be [**1-30**] influenza, also may be related to myoclonus. Will
   follow CK, urine output. Making adequate amounts of urine today so in
   setting of low EF hold of on additional IVF at this time.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   Continue beta blocker and ACEI, goal net even today
 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   Resolved, continue ASA (decrease to 81mg),  beta blocker, ACEI, and
   statin.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Continue rate control, need to titrate up beta blocker further. Holding
   on anticoagulation in setting of finding of RP hematoma.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) - Has baseline dementia, but
   below baseline functional status per family.
   - Seen by neurology, recommendations appreciated
   - Recent CT [**2-11**] without acute change, unable to tolerate MRI
   - seizure is less likely but follow up EEG
   - TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable, so toxic metabolic
   unlikely
   - Could have encephalitis related to influenza
   - treat infections as below
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          Transfuse 1 units PRBCs today, [**Male First Name (un) 482**] with 20mg IV lasix
   -          check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -          holding all heparin
   -          curbsided vascular, no intervention possible, keep INR ~1.5,
   serial HCTs
 Abdominal distension
   -          No evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen
   -          abdomen benign, follow serial exams.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER - suspected VAP
   -          WBC improved today, low grade fevers.
   -          Had grown MSSA from sputum, broadened earlier in the week to
   vanc/zosyn/cipro in the setting of witnessed apsiration and progressive
   leukocytosis.
   -          Reculture sputum
   -          Check CXR today
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   -          s/p oseltamivir course
 Transaminitis
   -          ALT, AST mildly elevated in setting of elevated CK
 suspect
   muscle source. Could be [**1-30**] influenza, also may be related to myoclonus
   -          Will follow CK, urine output
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   -          Continue beta blocker and ACEI, goal net even today
   -          Lasix to [**Male First Name (un) 482**] transfusion
 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   -          Resolved, continue ASA (decrease to 81mg given RP bleed),
   beta blocker, ACEI, and statin
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -          Continue rate control, need to titrate up beta blocker
   further. Holding on anticoagulation in setting of finding of RP
   hematoma. Continue ASA as tolerated

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, demand ischemia, and influenza. The patient has been experiencing clonus and remains poorly interactive. An attempt to perform an MRI was unsuccessful due to the patient's jitteriness despite receiving Ativan.

The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs. The last dose of antibiotics was administered on [**2151-2-12**] at 06:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including Lansoprazole (Prevacid), other ICU medications, and other medications. The medical and family history has been reviewed, and no significant changes were noted.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a heart rate of 112 bpm with an irregular rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 81/66 to 79/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on room air and receiving supplemental oxygen as needed.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,819 mL (821 mL IVF, 269 mL TF, 454 mL PO) and a total output of 1,400 mL (360 mL urine). The patient is also receiving blood products.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH level of 7.25, pCO2 of 29 mmHg, and HCO3- of 21 mEq/L. The SpO2 is 95% on room air.

Physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed, skin is not assessed, and neurologic assessment is also not performed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, normal platelet count (Plt), and various electrolyte imbalances such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-). Other lab results include elevated creatinine (Cr), TCO2, and glucose levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST), amylase, lipase, and elevated D-dimer levels.

Imaging studies reveal a moderately large left retroperitoneal hematoma, no evidence of bowel obstruction, sigmoid diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis, cholelithiasis, left greater than right bibasilar pleural effusions, copious stool within the rectum, and a hypoattenuating segment II liver lesion likely representing a cyst.

Microbiology results from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), peritoneal fluid (PND), and urine culture (UCx) are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status, retroperitoneal hematoma, abdominal distension, leukocytosis and fever suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pneumonia viral, transaminitis, heart failure (CHF) chronic systolic, demand ischemia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and others.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and lines management. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP is being provided."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a male with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, demand ischemia, and baseline dementia. He presented to the ICU with an altered mental status, which has been below baseline functional status according to the family. Neurology has been consulted, and recommendations are appreciated. The patient's recent CT scan did not show any acute changes, but he was unable to tolerate an MRI. Seizure is less likely, but follow-up EEG is planned. Toxic metabolic causes have been ruled out as TSH, B12, folate, and ammonia levels are unremarkable. Encephalitis related to influenza is a possibility and should be treated accordingly.

The patient has a moderately large left retroperitoneal hematoma, which is expanding the left psoas and quadratus lumborum. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction, but there is sigmoid diverticulosis without definitive evidence of acute diverticulitis. The patient also has cholelithiasis, left greater than right bibasilar pleural effusions, copious stool within the rectum, and a hypoattenuating segment II liver lesion likely representing a cyst.

The patient's leukocytosis and fever suggest suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has grown MSSA from sputum, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. Reculture of sputum and checking a chest X-ray today are planned. The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) - Has baseline dementia, but
   below baseline functional status per family
   - Seen by neurology, recommendations appreciated.
   - Recent CT [**2-11**] without acute change, unable to tolerate MRI
   - seizure is less likely. Could have encephalitis related to influenza.
   - TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable, so toxic metabolic
   unlikely
   - LP or EEG for now.
   -Treat infections as below
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -          holding all heparin
 Abdominal distension
   -          No evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen
   -          abdomen benign, follow serial exams.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER - suspected VAP
   -          WBC improved today, low grade fevers.
   -          Had grown MSSA from sputum, broadened earlier in the week to
   vanc/zosyn/cipro in the setting of witnessed apsiration and progressive
   leukocytosis.
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   -          s/p oseltamivir
 Transaminitis
   ALT, AST mildly elevated in setting of elevated CK
 suspect muscle
   source. Could be [**1-30**] influenza, also may be related to myoclonus. Will
   follow CK, urine output. Making adequate amounts of urine today so in
   setting of low EF hold of on additional IVF at this time.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   Continue beta blocker and ACEI, goal net even today
 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   Resolved, continue ASA beta blocker ACEI statin.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Continue rate control, need to titrate up beta blocker further. Holding
   on anticoagulation in setting of finding of RP hematoma.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia admitted to the ICU for influenza pneumonia. He underwent extubation and initially presented with delirium but showed some improvement in mental status. The patient is now on room air with good oxygenation. He has a history of chronic heart failure, likely due to influenza cardiomyopathy, and is on beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and aspirin.

The patient is also being treated for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, possibly related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). He is currently receiving vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's mental status has improved, and an EEG is pending. He has atrial fibrillation with poor rate control despite increased doses of metoprolol, and appears somewhat volume depleted.

There are concerns about a possible retroperitoneal bleed, as indicated by the dropping hematocrit. The patient has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells and a vascular surgery consult has been requested. Aspirin has been continued for now due to recent ischemia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/64 to 121/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breath"

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with dementia admitted with influenza pneumonia. He was extubated and developed delirium but showed some improvement in mental status. The patient has multiple medical conditions including pneumonia (influenza), heart failure (systolic and diastolic), acute, likely influenza cardiomyopathy, sepsis (severe with organ dysfunction), and altered mental status (not delirium). He is currently being treated empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia due to leukocytosis and concern for an aspiration event. The patient is on various medications including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, aspirin, and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 94/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The patient has atrial fibrillation with poor rate control despite increased doses of metoprolol. The physical examination reveals a thin and anxious appearance with an NG tube in place. There is no peripheral edema or jugular venous distension noted. The patient's extremities are absent pulses on the right side and present pulses on the left side. Neurological examination is not assessed due to myoclonus.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and elevated lactate acid level of 1.2 mmol/L. Other labs such as glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests are within normal ranges.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics empirically, checking sputum culture, repeating chest X-ray, and continuing beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy. The patient also requires transfusion as per the following orders: 2U PRBCs due to dropping hematocrit, vascular surgery consult, and continued aspirin therapy. The patient is on tube feeds, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's disposition is in the ICU, and his code status is full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 y/o M w/dementia admitted with influenza pneumonia, now s/p
   extubation with delirium but somewhat improved mental status.
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   Influenza.  Improved, now on room air.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:  Likely influenza
   cardiomyopathy.  On beta-blocker and ace inhibitor, statin, aspirin.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):  Being treated empirically
   for VAP/HCAP due to leukocytosis and concern for witnessed aspiration
   event.  Currently on vanc, zosyn, and cipro.
   - check sputum cx
   - repeat CXR
   - continue antibiotics for now as his leukocytosis has improved with
   starting this regimen
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**1-30**] sedation:  Mental status somewhat improved today.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Rate control has been poor with
   increased doses of metoprolol.  He appears somewhat volume depleted on
   exam.
   - transfuse as below
 Retroperitoneal bleed: Hct dropped again this AM but abdominal exam
   improved since yesterday.
   - transfuse 2U PRBCs
   - Vascular surgery consult given dropping hematocrit
   - continue aspirin for now given recent ischemia

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia admitted to the ICU for influenza pneumonia. He has since been extubated and is currently experiencing delirium with an improved mental status. The patient's medical history includes heart failure (systolic and diastolic), acute, likely due to influenza cardiomyopathy. He is on beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and aspirin.

The patient is also being treated for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which is being treated empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). He is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. The patient has leukocytosis and there is concern for a witnessed aspiration event.

Other conditions present in the patient include altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and a retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's hematocrit dropped again this morning, but his abdominal exam has improved since yesterday. He is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 115 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 94/64 mmHg to 121/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old thin elderly male with a history of poor dentition, NG tube in place, and presenting symptoms of altered mental status, clonus, and poorly interactive behavior. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, viral influenza, acute heart failure (systolic and diastolic), sepsis severe with organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), and acute myocardial infarction. The patient also has atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with viral pneumonia. This condition can lead to respiratory distress, infection spread to other organs, and sepsis.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute systolic and diastolic heart failure. This condition can result in fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to respiratory issues and compromised oxygenation.

3. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an infection spreading throughout the body, leading to organ failure.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient presents with altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as sepsis, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction. This can affect the patient's ability to interact, communicate, and make decisions.

5. Myocardial Infarction: The patient is diagnosed"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) - Has baseline dementia, but
   below baseline functional status per family.
   - Seen by neurology, recommendations appreciated
   - Recent CT [**2-11**] without acute change, unable to tolerate MRI
   - seizure is less likely but follow up EEG
   - TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable, so toxic metabolic
   unlikely
   - Could have encephalitis related to influenza
   - treat infections as below
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          Transfuse 1 units PRBCs today, [**Male First Name (un) 482**] with 20mg IV lasix
   -          check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -          holding all heparin
   -          curbsided vascular, no intervention possible, keep INR ~1.5,
   serial HCTs
 Abdominal distension
   -          No evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen
   -          abdomen benign, follow serial exams.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER - suspected VAP
   -          WBC improved today, low grade fevers.
   -          Had grown MSSA from sputum, broadened earlier in the week to
   vanc/zosyn/cipro in the setting of witnessed apsiration and progressive
   leukocytosis.
   -          Reculture sputum
   -          Check CXR today
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   -          s/p oseltamivir course
 Transaminitis
   -          ALT, AST mildly elevated in setting of elevated CK
 suspect
   muscle source. Could be [**1-30**] influenza, also may be related to myoclonus
   -          Will follow CK, urine output
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   -          Continue beta blocker and ACEI, goal net even today
   -          Lasix to [**Male First Name (un) 482**] transfusion
 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   -          Resolved, continue ASA (decrease to 81mg given RP bleed),
   beta blocker, ACEI, and statin
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -          Continue rate control, need to titrate up beta blocker
   further. Holding on anticoagulation in setting of finding of RP
   hematoma. Continue ASA as tolerated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with multiple medical conditions including altered mental status, retroperitoneal hematoma, abdominal distension, leukocytosis, pneumonia, transaminitis, heart failure, demand ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of dementia.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions. The medical team is monitoring the patient's vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is also on several medications such as piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, lansoprazole, and others.

The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood cultures have grown MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) from the sputum, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's imaging studies, including a CT scan, have not shown any acute changes. The patient's EEG has not been read yet. The patient's neurologic examination is abnormal, with poor interaction and clonus, but there are no assessments for movement, tone, or reflexes.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening of the retroperitoneal hematoma, development of further infections such as ventil"

   - TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable, so toxic metabolic
   unlikely
   - Could have encephalitis related to influenza
   - treat infections as below
   - restart home alzheimer
s meds
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          HCT stable today after appropraite response to yesterday
   transfusion, would check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -          holding all heparin
   -          curbsided vascular, no intervention possible, keep INR ~1.5,
   serial HCTs
 Abdominal distension
   -          No evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen
   -          abdomen benign, follow serial exams.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER - suspected VAP
   -          WBC stable today, low grade fevers continue
   -          Had grown MSSA from sputum [**2-5**],  coverage broadened earlier
   in the week to vanc/zosyn/cipro in the setting of witnessed apsiration
   and progressive leukocytosis.
   -          Likely will be impossible to obtain an uncontaminated sputum
   -          Given clinical improvement will narrow antibiotics to
   nafcillin (unlikely to have developed MRSA in 1 week
s time, and
   nafcillin is more cidal than vancomycin), d/c zosyn and cipro, change
   to levofloxacin for gram negative and atypicals

   -          s/p oseltamivir course
 Transaminitis
   -          suspect muscle source related to myoclonus as CKs were also
   elevated. Now resolving. Could also have been [**1-30**] influenza-related

 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   -          continue ASA (decrease to 81mg given RP bleed),  beta
   blocker, ACEI, and statin
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -          better rate control today, likely secondary to repleted
   intravascular volume s/p 1 unit of pRBCs yesterday.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a thin elderly male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and Alzheimer's disease. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, fever, and signs of infection. The patient had received multiple antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to MSSA infection.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/64 mmHg to 123/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and creatinine (Cr) levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++) levels.

Imaging studies reveal a persistent left lower lobe consolidation and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. There is also a new faint ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe, which could be due to aspiration.

The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status (not delirium), retroperitoneal hematoma, abdominal distension, leukocytosis, fever, suspected VAP, pneumonia, viral infection, transaminitis, heart failure"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male who was admitted with respiratory failure due to influenza pneumonia with a subsequent staphylococcus superinfection. The patient's conditions include pneumonia (resolved), heart failure (acute), sepsis (resolved), altered mental status (likely due to residual effects of sedation), myocardial infarction (likely secondary to sepsis/respiratory failure or cardiomyopathy), atrial fibrillation (rate control improved with blood transfusion), pneumonia (likely aspiration), anemia (blood-loss related to RP bleed), and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial chief complaint was hypoxemic respiratory failure. If not properly managed, there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Infection: The patient has had multiple infections, including influenza pneumonia and a subsequent staphylococcus superinfection. There is a possibility of developing new infections or the current infections worsening.

3. Heart failure: The patient is diagnosed with acute heart failure, which could potentially lead to further cardiac complications if not adequately treated.

4. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is still a risk of developing septic shock if the current conditions are not managed appropriately.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to residual effects of sedation. This can impact the patient's ability"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure due to influenza pneumonia with a subsequent staphylococcus superinfection. The patient's course has been complicated by aspiration and retroperitoneal bleeding. The patient's current conditions include viral pneumonia, acute heart failure (systolic and diastolic), acute sepsis with organ dysfunction, altered mental status, acute myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of pneumonia, exacerbation of heart failure, development of further sepsis or organ dysfunction, persistent altered mental status, potential recurrence of myocardial infarction, and uncontrolled atrial fibrillation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, heart function, hemodynamic stability, mental status, and cardiac rhythm to prevent or manage these potential complications. Additionally, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued to treat the staphylococcus superinfection and aspiration pneumonia. Close communication and coordination among the healthcare team members are crucial for the patient's care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old elderly male with a history of altered mental status, fever, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to suspected sepsis, pneumonia, heart failure, and possible myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm, and an irregular heart rhythm. The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 28 breaths per minute. Blood cultures were obtained at 04:17 AM. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin. Other medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid), and the patient is receiving IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, altered mental status, and suspected infection suggests the possibility of sepsis. If not managed promptly and effectively, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and respiratory distress indicate the possibility of pneumonia. Without appropriate treatment, pneumonia can worsen and may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's history of heart failure exacerbation, along with the presence of an S3 heart sound and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BN"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
  now worsened after brief
   improvement on [**2-15**].
   - f/u neurology recs
   - CT [**2-11**] without acute bleed or change (unable to tolerate MRI)
   - follow up EEG results
   - TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable, so toxic metabolic
   unlikely
   - Could have encephalopathy related to influenza
   - treat suspected aspiration pneumonia as below
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER
 may have a resistant gram negative
   aspiration PNA as he spiked through nafcillin/levo.
   -          Had grown MSSA from sputum [**2-5**],  low suspicion for MRSA
   -          Nonetheless, cover broadly fro HAP with vanc/zosyn/cipro  in
   the setting of witnessed aspiration and leukocytosis
   -          Will treat for 15 day course given suspicion for fermenting
   GNR
   -          Likely will be impossible to obtain an uncontaminated sputum
   -          f/u urine and blood cultures
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          HCT stable after appropriate response to transfusion

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old elderly male with multiple medical complications. He was admitted to the ICU due to poor mental status, fever, leukocytosis, and suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, demand ischemia, retroperitoneal hematoma, abdominal pain, transaminitis, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient may have developed aspiration pneumonia due to witnessed aspiration events. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover resistant gram-negative bacteria.
2. Resistant Gram-Negative Bacterial Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever suggest a possible resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover this possibility.
3. Retroperitoneal Hematoma: The patient has a history of retroperitoneal hematoma, which is causing abdominal pain. Serial HCTs are being monitored, and appropriate transfusion is being done as necessary.
4. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic heart failure, and medical management with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors is being continued.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and rate control is being achieved with metoprolol. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in the setting of the patient's retroperitoneal hematoma, but low-dose aspirin is being continued.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
  now worsened after brief
   improvement on [**2-15**].
   - f/u any neurology recs
   - Recent CT [**2-11**] without acute change, (unable to tolerate MRI)
   - seizure or status epilepticus is much less likely but follow up EEG
   - TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable, so toxic metabolic
   unlikely
   - Could have encephalitis related to influenza
   - treat infections as below
   - restart home alzheimer
s meds
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          HCT stable today after appropraite response to yesterday
   transfusion, would check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -          holding all heparin
   -          curbsided vascular, no intervention possible, keep INR ~1.5,
   serial HCTs
 Abdominal distension
   -          No evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen
   -          abdomen benign, follow serial exams.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER - suspected VAP
   -          WBC stable today, low grade fevers continue
   -          Had grown MSSA from sputum [**2-5**],  coverage broadened earlier
   in the week to vanc/zosyn/cipro in the setting of witnessed apsiration
   and progressive leukocytosis.
   -          Likely will be impossible to obtain an uncontaminated sputum
   -          Given clinical improvement will narrow antibiotics to
   nafcillin (unlikely to have developed MRSA in 1 week
s time, and
   nafcillin is more cidal than vancomycin), d/c zosyn and cipro, change
   to levofloxacin for gram negative and atypicals
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   -          s/p oseltamivir course
 Transaminitis
   -          suspect muscle source related to myoclonus as CKs were also
   elevated. Now resolving. Could also have been [**1-30**] influenza-related
   myopathy
   -          CKs trending downwards, making good urine, no e/o rhabdo
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   -          Continue beta blocker and ACEI
 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   -          continue ASA (decrease to 81mg given RP bleed),  beta
   blocker, ACEI, and statin
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -          better rate control today, likely secondary to repleted
   intravascular volume s/p 1 unit of pRBCs yesterday.
   -          Continue metoprolol 75 qid
   -          Holding on anticoagulation in setting of finding of RP
   hematoma. Continue ASA as tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly, frail individual with multiple medical complications. They were admitted with a history of fever, altered mental status, and suspected sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a retroperitoneal hematoma. They have been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antivirals, and medications for their heart condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has leukocytosis and fever, suggesting a possible infection. Given their history of witnessed aspiration and progressive leukocytosis, there is a risk of VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the patient's sputum culture results are pending.

2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status has been worsening despite initial improvement. It is important to rule out delirium, which can be caused by multiple factors such as infections, medications, or metabolic disturbances.

3. Seizure or status epilepticus: Although less likely, the patient's mental status changes should be closely monitored for any signs of seizure activity. An EEG is planned for further evaluation.

4. Encephalitis: Considering the patient's recent influenza infection, encephalitis related to influenza should be considered. It is important to rule out this possibility through further investigations.

5. Retroperitoneal hematoma: The patient has a retroperitoneal hematoma, which"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 much improved
   - f/u any neurology recs
   - Recent CT [**2-11**] without acute change, (unable to tolerate MRI)
   - seizure or status epilepticus is much less likely but follow up EEG
   - TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable, so toxic metabolic
   unlikely
   - Could have encephalitis related to influenza
   - treat infections as below
   - restart home alzheimer
s meds
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          HCT stable today after appropraite response to yesterday
   transfusion, would check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -          holding all heparin
   -          curbsided vascular, no intervention possible, keep INR ~1.5,
   serial HCTs
 Abdominal distension
   -          No evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen
   -          abdomen benign, follow serial exams.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER - suspected VAP
   -          WBC stable today, low grade fevers continue
   -          Had grown MSSA from sputum [**2-5**],  coverage broadened earlier
   in the week to vanc/zosyn/cipro in the setting of witnessed apsiration
   and progressive leukocytosis.
   -          Likely will be impossible to obtain an uncontaminated sputum
   -          Given clinical improvement will narrow antibiotics to
   nafcillin (unlikely to have developed MRSA in 1 week
s time, and
   nafcillin is more cidal than vancomycin), d/c zosyn and cipro, change
   to levofloxacin for gram negative and atypicals
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   -          s/p oseltamivir course
 Transaminitis
   -          suspect muscle source related to myoclonus as CKs were also
   elevated. Now resolving. Could also have been [**1-30**] influenza-related
   myopathy
   -          CKs trending downwards, making good urine, no e/o rhabdo
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   -          Continue beta blocker and ACEI
 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   -          continue ASA (decrease to 81mg given RP bleed),  beta
   blocker, ACEI, and statin
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -          better rate control today, likely secondary to repleted
   intravascular volume s/p 1 unit of pRBCs yesterday.
   -          Continue metoprolol 75 qid
   -          Holding on anticoagulation in setting of finding of RP
   hematoma. Continue ASA as tolerated

- The patient presented with altered mental status and fever.
- The patient has a history of pneumonia, which was initially treated with antibiotics.
- The patient has leukocytosis and fever, indicating a suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has a retroperitoneal hematoma, for which heparin therapy is being held and serial HCTs are being monitored.
- The patient has abdominal distension without evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen.
- The patient has transaminitis, which is thought to be related to myoclonus or recent influenza infection.
- The patient has heart failure (CHF), chronic systolic, and is being treated with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors.
- The patient has demand ischemia and is being treated with aspirin, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and is being treated with metoprolol for rate control.
- The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.
- The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient's leukocytosis and fever suggest a possible VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have already been initiated, but it is important to monitor for clinical improvement and obtain appropriate sputum cultures to guide further treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He was previously intubated due to influenza pneumonia and is now extubated. The patient's mental status improved initially but worsened overnight, with the development of fever and worsening lung infiltrates on imaging. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 103-164 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a face tent. The patient has atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm.

The patient has several medical complications, including suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), retroperitoneal bleed, viral pneumonia caused by influenza, acute heart failure with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction, resolved severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), and acute myocardial infarction.

Plan:
1. Treat the suspected VAP/HCAP with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin for a total 15-day course.
2. Repeat hemoglobin and transfuse if the patient's Hct is less than 28.
3. Hold anticoagulation due to the retroperitoneal bleed.
4. Continue IV fluids for acute heart failure.
5. Monitor and manage the"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 y/o M w/influenza pneumonia, now s/p extubation.  Originally had
   improving mental status, but overnight was febrile and this AM looks
   worse than yesterday.
 FEVER:  Likely due to VAP/HCAP.  His abx were narrowed yesterday to
   cover aspiration pneumonia, so the new fever suggests that he has
   either MRSA, pseudomonas, or another resistant gram negative.  He has
   repeat cultures pending.
   - will treat with vanc, zosyn, and cipro for total 15 day course
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED: Hct has been stable, INR 1.5.  Will repeat pm
   Hct and transfuse if <28.
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL:  Influenza
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:  Appeared volume

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was previously intubated and is now extubated. He had improving mental status but overnight became febrile and looked worse than the previous day. The patient has a history of influenza pneumonia and is being treated for aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics. The patient has developed a fever, suggesting a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). Cultures have been obtained and the patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin for a total of 15 days.

The patient also has a retroperitoneal bleed with a decreased hemoglobin level. The patient's heart failure (CHF) is being managed with IV fluids and medications. The patient's sepsis has resolved. The patient's altered mental status is not delirium and the patient is sedated. The patient had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but the latest troponin level is within normal range. The patient has atrial fibrillation but is not on anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's worsening condition and fever may indicate the development of VAP. Empirical antibiotic therapy has been initiated to cover potential pathogens including MRSA, pseudomonas, and other resistant gram-negative bacteria"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient remains confused and has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, for which they have been started on diltiazem. They have a history of pneumonia, heart failure, altered mental status, and a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/69 to 200/174 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 66.4 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,884 mL and output of 2,310 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 574 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal range. Imaging shows persistent left lower lobe collapse and small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions. The patient is on various medications including diltiazem, metoprolol, and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive fluid analysis suggesting the presence of bacteria indicate a possible ongoing infection. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
  remains poor but stable after
   brief improvement on [**2-15**].
   - f/u neurology recs, if no response to antibiotics may need to
   consider LP
   - CT [**2-11**] without acute bleed or change (unable to tolerate MRI)
   - follow up final EEG results
   - TSH, B12, folate, ammonia all unremarkable, so toxic metabolic
   unlikely
   - Could have encephalopathy related to influenza
   - no evidence of UTI, treating known infections (suspected aspiration
   pneumonia) as below
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER
 may have a resistant gram negative
   aspiration PNA as he spiked through nafcillin/levo.
   -          Leukocytosis improving but remains low grade febrile
   -          covering broadly for HAP with vanc/zosyn/cipro  in the
   setting of witnessed aspiration and leukocytosis
   -          Will treat for 15 day course given suspicion for fermenting
   GNR
   -          f/u urine and blood cultures
   -          RP bleed with breakdown could be etiology of fever as well
 Retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          HCT stable >48 hrs
   -          check HCT daily, transfuse <27
   -          holding all heparin
   -          curbsided vascular, no intervention possible, keep INR ~1.5,
   serial HCTs
 Abdominal Pain
   -          likely due to retroperitoneal hematoma, no evidence of
   obstruction on CT abdomen
   -          follow serial exams.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -          rate control improved with addition of CCB
   -          Continue metoprolol 50 qid, dilt 30 qid
   -          No anticoagulation in setting of finding of RP hematoma but
   continue low dose ASA.
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL
   -          s/p oseltamivir course
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   -          Continue medical management with beta blocker and ACEI
 DEMAND ISCHEMIA
   -          continue [**Hospital 1034**] medical management with ASA (decreased to 81mg
   given RP bleed),  beta blocker, ACEI,  CCB, and statin

","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, febrile, and leukocytosis. The patient's condition has been stable with intermittent improvement. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 109/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is currently on several medications including diltiazem, metoprolol, and other ICU medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals confusion, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, coarse breath sounds with end expiratory wheezes anteriorly, and good peripheral pulses at distal points bilaterally. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, prolonged PT/PTT/INR, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal persistent left lower lobe collapse and small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status, leukocytosis and fever, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, abdominal pain, retroperitoneal hematoma, chronic heart failure, and demand ischemia. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia and has been started on vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's code status is"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 y/o man with ongoing encephalopathy, as well as atrial fibrillation,
   following respiratory failure from influenza.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (DELIRIUM).  Mental status has improved a bit.
   Investigated with CT and LP, which have been unrevealing.  Neurology is
   following.  Suspect he will slowly clear and that this is essentially
   toxic/metabolic.
 INFLUENZA PNEUMONIA -- s/p rx
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and FEVER
 Although we documented a Staph
   superinfection of his influenza pneumonia, his fairly unequivocal
   clinical response to tapering antibiotics (high fever, worse mental
   status) suggests that he may have additional pathogens that we failed
   to culture that are resistant to nafcillin/levofloxacin.  We will
   therefore treat for presumptive ventilator-acquired pneumonia for a
   full 15-day course.  Follow up other cultures.
 CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, SYSTOLIC, ACUTE
 the best explanation for
   this is probably viral cardiomyopathy, although certainly other things
   are in the differential.  Will need ongoing titration of afterload
   reduction, rate control, etc.  His compensation is substantially
   improved.
 RETROPERITONEAL HEMATOMA
 likely secondary to anticoagulation
   -          HCT stable >48 hrs
   -          check HCT daily, transfuse <27
   -          resume DVT prophylaxis dose heparin.  Reconsider
   anticoagulation later, potentially during this admission
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -          rate is adequately controlled at present
   -          see above regarding anticoagulation
 NSTEMI
   -          although he meets criteria for NSTEMI, this was most likely
   either myocarditis or demand.  Continue ASA (decreased to 81mg given RP
   bleed),  beta blocker, ACEI,  CCB, and statin

","The patient is a 79-year-old man with ongoing encephalopathy, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure from influenza. He is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

1. Altered Mental Status (Delirium): The patient's mental status has improved slightly but remains altered. CT and LP results were unrevealing, and neurology is following up. It is suspected that this is toxic/metabolic in nature.

2. Influenza Pneumonia: The patient had documented Staph superinfection of his influenza pneumonia. His clinical response to tapering antibiotics suggests additional pathogens that are resistant to nafcillin/levofloxacin. Therefore, he will be treated for presumptive ventilator-acquired pneumonia with a full 15-day course of antibiotics. Other cultures will be followed up.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute: The best explanation for this is viral cardiomyopathy, although other possibilities are also considered. Ongoing titration of afterload reduction, rate control, etc. is needed. His compensation has substantially improved.

4. Retroperitoneal Hematoma: This is likely secondary to anticoagulation. HCT should be stable for more than 48 hours, checked daily, and transfused if less than 27. DVT prophylaxis with heparin should be resumed, and anticoagulation should be reconsidered during this admission.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old man with ongoing encephalopathy and atrial fibrillation, following respiratory failure from influenza. He has a history of pneumonia, heart failure (both systolic and diastolic), acute altered mental status, retroperitoneal bleed, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of viral influenza and is currently experiencing encephalopathy. This could be due to secondary bacterial pneumonia or worsening of the viral infection.
2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute systolic and diastolic heart failure, which may be exacerbated by his current condition and could lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's encephalopathy needs to be closely monitored as it could progress to delirium or worsen cognitive function.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events like stroke or pulmonary embolism.
5. Retroperitoneal Bleed (RP Bleed): The patient has a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed, which requires careful monitoring for signs of worsening or expansion of the bleed.
6. Glycemic Control: The patient requires regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control due to his critical condition.
7. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer proph"
