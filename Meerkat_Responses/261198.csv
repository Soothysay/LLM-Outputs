","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of head and neck cancer, who was admitted for hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was transferred to the MICU due to melena. The patient underwent an endoscopy that revealed an actively bleeding vessel around the PEG site in the stomach. Several clamps were applied but were unable to stop the bleeding completely. A surgical consult was obtained, and the patient was referred to general surgery for repair of the vessel. The surgical repair of the arterial bleed involved oversewing of the gastrostomy site and placement of a new G-tube. The patient received a total of 6 units of red blood cells and 1 unit of platelets.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced hypertension, which improved with pain control. She also had tachypnea and was breathing over the set ventilatory rate. Allergies were noted as no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given at 06:00 PM on [**2173-8-4**] and 12:42 AM on [**2173-8-5**]. Infusions included propofol at 55 mcg/kg/min, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, pantoprazole (Protonix), and morphine sulfate. Other medications were also administered.

The patient's vital signs included a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 105 bpm (88-141 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 117/59 mmHg to 196/121 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (9-33 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm was sinus tachycardia.

The flow sheet data showed a fluid balance with total input of 4,520 mL and output of 1,155 mL. The patient received 2,416 mL of IV fluids and 675 mL of TBSA fluid. Blood products totaling 754 mL were transfused. The respiratory support included an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicated a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 27 mmHg, HCO3- of 133 mEq/L, and base excess of -1 mEq/L.

Physical examination revealed a sedated and intubated patient who was nonresponsive to verbal stimuli. No conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus was observed. Pinpoint pupils were present bilaterally. The cardiac examination showed tachycardia with regular rate, S1, S2, and S4 heart sounds. No murmurs, rubs,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of head and neck cancer, admitted for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient underwent endoscopy, which revealed actively bleeding vessels around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site in the stomach. Despite applying several clamps, the bleeding could not be completely stopped, prompting surgical consultation and subsequent transfer to the operating room for surgical repair of the bleeding vessel.

Upon receiving the patient back in the ICU, multiple interventions were performed. The patient was started on multi-lumen and arterial lines, invasive ventilation, and transfused with four units of packed red blood cells (RBCs), with a critical increase in hematocrit (Hct) from 19.5 to 23.6. Two additional units of RBCs were given due to ongoing bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 105 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 117/59 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's temperature (Tmax) is 37.7°C and current temperature (Tcurrent) is 36.6°C.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (W"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated post-op.  Good progress with
   SBT 0 --> extubated this AM during rounds.
   GI BLEED -- Attributed to oozing gastric vessel, immediately adjacent
   to gastric tube.  Unclear whether partially thrombosed vein or artery.
   Transfused 6 units PRBC, and  and General surgery performed oversewing
   of bleeding site.  Continue trend Hct.  Hold ASA, plavix, lovenox
   -->eventually will need to resume.  Monitor VS and stool output.
   PNEUMONIA -- LLL infiltrate on CXR, not progressing.  Plan continue
   antimicrobials for complete 7 day course.
   ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYEMS -- likely reflects demand ischemia (pneumonia,
   and profound anemia in context of GI bleed)
   ANEMIA -- blood loss, attributed to gastric vessel bleed.  Monitor
   serial Hct, maintain >27
   FLUIDS -- Euvolemic currently.  Maintain balacne.
   TACHYCARDIA -- attributed to hypovolemia, GI bleed.  Monitor as volume
   repleted.
   COPD -- No active issues.  Continue usual meds.
   LARYNGEAL CA -- advanced, s/p treatment.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO for now.  Resume TF once ileus resolved (now
   with new G-tube)

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which required surgical intervention to oversew a bleeding gastric vessel. The patient received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and their hematocrit (Hct) has improved from 19 to 31.

The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure but has been successfully extubated during rounds this morning. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (T) of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 104-187 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and a surgical incision in the left quadrant of the abdomen. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows normal perfusion, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs. The respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds with diminished sound at the left base. The abdominal examination shows soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 195 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count (Pl"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of head and neck cancer who was admitted for hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has undergone surgical intervention for gastrointestinal bleeding and has received aggressive fluid resuscitation.

The patient's current medical conditions include pneumonia, hypertension, respiratory failure, acute pain, chronic pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and metastatic cancer. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated and experiencing tachypnea, which may be due to postsurgical pain and discomfort related to the endotracheal tube. Weaning sedation and performing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) are planned, with the goal of extubation today if possible.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had a gastric arterial bleed and underwent surgical repair with gastrostomy placement. She received blood transfusions and will be monitored for any signs of rebleeding. Close monitoring of hemodynamics, urine output, and coagulation parameters is necessary.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has hyperchloremic non-anion gap acidosis secondary to aggressive fluid resuscitation. This should be corrected as needed.
4. Cardiac complications: Elevated troponin levels indicate cardiac ischemia, which may be related to the patient's underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). The use of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, aspirin, and Plavix should be held pending stabilization"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of head and neck cancer admitted for hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was transferred to the MICU for melena, which was found to be caused by a gastric arterial bleed. The patient underwent endoscopy with arterial vessel clip placement and surgical repair, as well as gastrostomy placement. She received aggressive fluid resuscitation and received 6 units of red blood cells. Her baseline hematocrit level was around 30%, and it has remained stable overnight.

The patient's respiratory distress has resolved, but she remains intubated following her surgical intervention. She is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia and is not currently requiring supplemental oxygen. The patient also has an altered mental status, possibly due to expressive aphasia. This could be related to her history of taking aspirin and enoxaparin, but the suspicion of a transient ischemic attack or delirium is low. A CT scan of the head without contrast was performed, and a thorough neurological exam will be conducted.

The patient's oncologist has decided not to administer the final radiation treatment today. She will be transferred back to the oncology department for completion of treatment. The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, and her cardiac status shows elevated troponins that are trending down, likely representing demand ischemia in the setting of pneumonia. The troponin levels are also decreasing following the gastrointestinal bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an ICU admit post-op from an emergent exploratory laparotomy due to GI bleed. The patient remains intubated for respiratory failure. There was a gastric vessel bleed attributed to the gastric tube, resulting in significant blood loss. The patient received a transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and general surgery performed an oversewing of the bleeding site. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is being trended. Medications including aspirin, Plavix, and lovenox have been held temporarily but will need to be resumed eventually. Vital signs are being monitored, along with stool output.

The patient has a pneumonia in the left lower lobe (LLL) on chest X-ray, which is not improving. The plan is to continue antimicrobials for a complete 7-day course. The patient also has elevated cardiac enzymes, likely due to demand ischemia caused by pneumonia and profound anemia in the context of GI bleed.

The patient has anemia due to blood loss from the gastric vessel bleed. Serial Hct levels are being monitored to maintain a level greater than 27. The patient is euvolemic and fluids are being maintained in balance.

The patient has a history of tachycardia attributed to hypovolemia from the GI bleed. This will be monitored as volume is repleted. The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with no"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has a history of gastric bleeding around the g-tube site, for which they underwent surgery and received a blood transfusion.
- The patient is currently on various medications including labetalol, morphine sulfate, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and others.
- Vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/80 mmHg to 142/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient is alert and awake but somewhat disoriented with expressive aphasia. Neurological exam is unremarkable except for the disorientation. Lung sounds are clear, and there is no edema in the extremities.
- The patient's abdominal wound is intact, but there is ecchymosis in the lower left quadrant (LLQ) with diffuse tenderness.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including GI bleed, pneumonia, elevated cardiac enzymes, anemia, COPD, laryngeal cancer, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- The patient's nutrition is currently restricted due to being NPO (nothing by mouth).
- The patient has multiple lines including a midline and tunneled (Hickman)"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer, COPD, and pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU due to a gastric bleeding episode attributed to an oozing vessel adjacent to his gastric tube. The patient received a transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and underwent a surgical procedure to oversew the bleeding site. His hemoglobin (Hct) level is currently being monitored, and he is advised to maintain a level above 27. 

The patient also has elevated cardiac enzymes, which are likely due to demand ischemia caused by factors such as pneumonia and profound anemia in the context of the GI bleed. 

Other ongoing issues include anemia, COPD, and pneumonia. The patient's pneumonia is not progressing, and he will continue with a complete 7-day course of antimicrobials. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines (midline and tunneled Hickman line) are being managed. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also being provided. 

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition will be determined based on his progress. The total time spent in the ICU so far is not mentioned."

   Assessment and Plan
   GI BLEED -- Attributed to oozing gastric vessel, immediately adjacent
   to gastric tube.  Unclear whether partially thrombosed vein or artery.
   Transfused 6 units PRBC, and  and General surgery performed oversewing
   of bleeding site.  Continue trend Hct.  Hold ASA, plavix, lovenox
   -->eventually will need to resume.  Monitor VS and stool output.
   PNEUMONIA -- LLL infiltrate on CXR, not progressing.  Plan continue
   antimicrobials for complete 7 day course.
   ? Expressive aphasia, confusion
 non-contrast head CT
   ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYEMS -- likely reflects demand ischemia (pneumonia,
   and profound anemia in context of GI bleed)
   ANEMIA -- blood loss, attributed to gastric vessel bleed.  Monitor
   serial Hct, maintain >27
   COPD -- No active issues.  Continue usual meds.
   LARYNGEAL CA -- advanced, s/p treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of laryngeal cancer, COPD, and pneumonia. He presented to the ICU with gastric bleeding around the g-tube site, confusion, and expressive aphasia. He underwent surgery for bleeding control and received a transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells. His current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 157/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on multiple medications, including labetalol, morphine sulfate, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated cardiac enzymes. He has a history of elevated liver enzymes, electrolyte imbalances, and renal function abnormalities. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, for which he is receiving antibiotics. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis is crucial.
2. Bleeding: Although the bleeding from the gastric vessel has been controlled, the patient's low hemoglobin level indicates significant blood loss. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and serial Hct (hematocrit) levels is necessary to assess for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with the following chief complaints: pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), gastrointestinal bleed (melena), hypertension, pain control (acute and chronic), and possible hospital-acquired infections. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications including antibiotics (erythromycin, vancomycin, piperacillin), labetalol, morphine sulfate, metoprolol, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, and potentially respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure. If left untreated, this condition can progress to more severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has signs of gastrointestinal bleeding (melena). If not managed promptly, this can lead to significant blood loss, hypotension, and shock.

4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac events.

5. Pain Management: The patient requires pain control for both acute and chronic pain. Inadequate pain management"
