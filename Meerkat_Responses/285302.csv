   Assessment and Plan
   68F with DLBCL unresponsive to chemo now day ?16 from most recent
   [**Hospital 2033**] transferred to ICU on [**2163-9-7**] in the setting of hypotension and
   tachycardia found to have tamponade-like physiologic on bedside echo
   thought d/t extrinsic compression on LV from pleural effusion, ascites.
   # Hypotension: Most likely due to tamponade-like physiology given above
   with extrinsic compression of LV worsened by IVC compression and
   decreased venous return.  This is further suggested by her more acute
   decompensation following IV lasix this am.  Given her neutropenia and
   recent R-CHOP, must also explore other causes of hypotension including
   sepsis and adrenal insufficiency.  Urine cultures from [**8-31**] and [**9-3**]
   have been negative and blood cultures from [**9-5**] have shown no growth
   to date (no other culture data from this admission and cultures from
   last admission are all negative).  No clear localizing symptoms of
   infection and abdominal pain/distention seems most likely d/t ileus,
   abdominal lymphoma and worsening ascites as opposed to clear source of
   infection.  She's has been on empiric cipro/flagyl since [**9-3**],
   transitioned to cefepime/vanco/flagyl this am.  Not entirely clear when
   last dose of prednisone with R-CHOP delivered, but also seems less
   likely etiology given acuity of decompensation.  Was hyponatremic
   (since resolved after IVFs) with urine Na <10 suggestive of
   hypovolemia, but certainly not sole cause of her marked hypotension.
        S/p bilateral thoracentesis with approximately 1400ml fluid
   removal. Appropriate [**Last Name (un) **] response.
   - Continue on neosynephrine with goal MAPs >60
   - Consider paracentesis in am (bedside ultrasound shows dilated loops
   of bowel with smaller pockets of fluid)
   - IVF bolus for increasing pressor requirement or low UOP; acknowledge
   needs preload in the above setting, however she is 3rd spacing a
   significant amount of crystalloid delivered.
   - Follow blood and urine cultures
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with cefepime/vanco/flagyl
   # SOB/hypoxia:  In the setting of large bilateral pleural effusions now
   s/p bilateral thoracenteses.  Maintaining O2 sats 98-100% on NRB and
   symptomatically slightly improved after [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - Attempt to wean O2 as we are able
   # DLBCL:  Unresponsive to chemo thus far.  Will defer to oncology team
   regarding this, however, will continue to address goals of care with
   patient and family.
   # Pancytopenia:  In the setting of recent rx for DLBCL.
   - continue to monitor counts
   - neutropenic precautions
   # Ileus/abdominal distention:  Likely ileus in the setting of
   narcotics.  No clear transition point to suggest obstruction on
   imaging.  Appreciate surgery recs.

   - NGT to suction currently
   - Starting PO narcan - although patient unable to take given
   considerable NGT output
   - Serial abdominal exams
   # Elevated t. bili:  AST mildly elevated, but ALT and alk phos normal.
   RUQ U/S without clear evidence of obstruction.  Bili mainly direct. LDH
   up (in setting of her lymphoma) and haptoglobin elevated on [**9-5**] (as
   acute phase reactant) so seems unlikely due to hemolysis.  No clear
   meds that might cause cholestatic picture, however will review with
   pharmacy.  ? cholestasis in setting of sepsis.
   - Continue to trend
   - fractionate and add on haptoglobin
   # Hyponatremia:  As low as 127 this am with urine lytes c/w prerenal
   etiology (Urine Na <10).  Has since normalized after receiving several
   liters of IV NS.
   - continue to monitor
   # Left shoulder Pain: Chronic issue, documented at office vist in
   [**Month (only) 779**].  Pain has progressed and pt now reported tingling in left
   fingertips. ROM limited due to pain. Xray on previous admission w/ OA
   of left shoulder joint however pt's symptoms appear more muscular/nerve
   related. ? of lymphomatous nerve compression, cervical spine
   abnormality.
   - morphine for pain control currently
   # GERD:  Continue PPI.
   # FEN:  Nutrition status very poor with albumin of 1.8.  Holding
   enteral feeding given ileus and abdominal distention.  Addtionally has
   only double lumen PICC through which abx, pressors, and IVFs going;
   thus no access for TPN at this time anyhow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who is unresponsive to chemotherapy. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and tachycardia, and a bedside echo revealed tamponade-like physiology caused by extrinsic compression of the left ventricle from a pleural effusion and ascites. The patient also has pancytopenia, likely due to recent chemotherapy, and is neutropenic. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics since September 3rd and has negative blood cultures. Other conditions include ileus, abdominal distention, elevated total bilirubin, hyponatremia, left shoulder pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and poor nutritional status. The patient's code status is full code, and her goals of care will be readdressed with the patient and family. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to tamponade-like physiology caused by extrinsic compression of the LV from pleural effusion and ascites. Other potential causes include sepsis and adrenal insufficiency. Urine cultures have been negative, and blood cultures show no growth to date.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is still a risk of developing sepsis due to her neutropenia and recent chemotherapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia. She has been unresponsive to chemotherapy and has multiple comorbidities, including pancytopenia, ileus, abdominal distention, elevated total bilirubin, hyponatremia, left shoulder pain, GERD, and poor nutrition status. The patient's current condition is complicated by tamponade-like physiology due to extrinsic compression of the left ventricle from pleural effusion and ascites. She also has hypoxia, likely due to large bilateral pleural effusions, which have been partially relieved by bilateral thoracentesis. The patient's blood cultures have shown no growth, and urine cultures have been negative. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's prognosis is guarded, and her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to tamponade-like physiology caused by extrinsic compression of the left ventricle from pleural effusion and ascites. Other potential causes include sepsis and adrenal insufficiency.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's blood cultures have shown no growth, there is a possibility of ongoing infection that could lead to sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who is unresponsive to chemotherapy. She was admitted to the ICU on [**2163-9-7**] due to hypotension and tachycardia, and was found to have tamponade-like physiology on bedside echo, which was thought to be caused by extrinsic compression on the left ventricle from a pleural effusion and ascites. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and the healthcare provider (HCP) decided yesterday that the patient will be made do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) and will pursue comfort measures only (CMO). Pressors, antibiotics, and other treatments were stopped, and the patient is now receiving morphine as needed for comfort. The plan is to start a low-dose morphine drip and continue monitoring the patient for pain or discomfort. The patient's code status has been changed to comfort measures only, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pleural effusion: The patient has an acute pleural effusion, which can lead to respiratory complications such as difficulty breathing, decreased oxygen saturation, and potential pneumonia.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient is currently experiencing AF, which may increase the risk of clot formation and subsequent stroke.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been unresponsive to chemotherapy. She was transferred to the ICU on [**2163-9-7**] due to hypotension and tachycardia, and it was discovered that she had tamponade-like physiology on bedside echo, believed to be caused by extrinsic compression of the left ventricle from a pleural effusion and ascites. The patient's condition has been downgraded to comfort measures only (CMO) after the healthcare proxy (HCP) decided yesterday that the patient would not receive life-sustaining treatments such as pressors, antibiotics, or other interventions. Instead, the focus is on providing comfort and pain relief using morphine as needed, starting a low-dose morphine drip, and removing oxygen saturation monitoring. The patient's family has been informed and agrees with the plan. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 86/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. There are also findings of acute pleural effusion and atrial fibrillation.
