","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis and post-obstructive renal failure.
- The patient presented with symptoms of N/V, weakness, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI), pyelonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and sepsis.
- The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Cefepime, and Flagyl) for the UTI and bowel flora.
- A percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed, but there has been persistent sanguinous drainage.
- The patient's lactate levels remain elevated despite fluid resuscitation.
- The patient's kidney function is impaired, likely due to post-obstructive renal failure with pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
- The patient's creatinine levels are trending downward with fluid boluses and adequate urine output.
- The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis with a gap of 15, likely due to lactic acidosis and ARF.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with persistent elevation of bilirubin and LDH.
- The patient's lipase levels were initially elevated but have now resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis and post-obstructive renal failure, presenting with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and weakness. He was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) with pyelonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and sepsis. The patient underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage but continues to have persistent bloody drainage. He is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for the UTI and sepsis. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and liver enzymes. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing tachycardia, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels despite fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe sepsis: The patient's presentation with low-grade fever, persistent tachycardia, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels suggests ongoing sepsis. If not promptly addressed, this can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of post-obstructive renal failure and is currently experiencing ATN. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed properly.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture indicating a UTI. If left untreated, the infection can spread to other organs"

The patient underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage but still has persistent bloody drainage. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and leukocytosis. His hemodynamic monitoring indicates fluid balance with total input of 8,485 mL and total output of 3,595 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen with a SpO2 of 98% and no other interventions. 

The physical examination reveals scleral icterus, mild mental confusion, clear lung sounds without wheezing or rales, regular rhythm without murmurs, and no abdominal tenderness or palpable masses. Extremities show warmth and weak pulses, with diminished pulses in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as decreased urine output. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in liver function tests (LFTs) and electrolyte levels. The patient's urine gram stain shows 3+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes, indicating an active infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of nephrolithiasis, post-obstructive renal failure, and urosepsis. She presents with nausea, vomiting, weakness, and is found to have urinary tract infection (UTI), pyelonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and severe sepsis. The patient underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage but experienced persistent bloody drainage. CT scan findings suggest the renal system as the likely source of infection. The patient is growing gram-positive rods from an anaerobic bottle, which is most commonly Corynebacterium or another species. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and flagyl has been discontinued due to low suspicion for a bowel source. Liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and lipase levels have returned to normal, indicating collateral inflammation surrounding the renal infection. The patient's condition is complicated by hypercalcemia, fever, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's sodium levels are persistently high. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and an H2 blocker. The patient's disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)
2. Pyelonephritis
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
4. Sepsis
