","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures. He presents with likely withdrawal seizures and mental status changes. The patient has been treated with IV Ativan for withdrawal symptoms and has shown a good response. He is unable to take some oral medications due to spitting them out. His vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total input of 1,043 mL and output of 295 mL. He is receiving IV fluids and has an oxygen saturation of 98%. The physical examination reveals a hematoma and ecchymosis over the right eye, distant heart sounds, clear but dry mucous membranes, and no edema or jugular venous distention.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count, normal creatinine level, low potassium, and slightly elevated sodium and chloride levels. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range. Troponin-T levels are below the detection limit. The patient's bilirubin level is mildly elevated, indicating possible liver disease.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is assessed to have alcohol withdrawal symptoms, for which he has been prescribed diazepam and ativan. Seizure precautions have been implemented. The patient's history of alcohol abuse is noted, and he is recommended to receive thiamine, folate, and multivitamins. Social work and addiction consultation are also planned. The patient's elevated bilirubin level is likely secondary to underlying liver disease from alcohol use. Thrombocytopenia and anemia are also present. The patient's nutritional status, glycemic control, and lines in place are monitored. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures, which can lead to further seizures if not properly managed.
2. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, and autonomic instability. It can occur within 48-96 hours after the last drink and requires prompt medical attention.
3. Wernicke's encephalopathy: This condition is caused by thiamine deficiency commonly seen in alcoholics. Symptoms include confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Immediate administration of thiamine is crucial to prevent further neurological damage.
4. Liver disease: The patient's elevated bilirubin level suggests possible liver dysfunction. Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, which may require specific interventions.
5. Infection: Immunosuppression due to alcohol abuse increases the risk of infections, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures. He presents with likely withdrawal seizures, and it has been 6 days since his last drink. The patient's ETOH level in the tox screen was negative. He has been started on diazepam for CIWA scale and seizure precautions. The patient also has a long history of alcohol abuse, which is likely causing his elevated bilirubin levels and liver disease. Additionally, the patient has liver nodules, an esophageal stricture, and a history of tuberculosis with pneumothoraces, which were treated with antibiotics. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving IV fluids for hydration. He is also on seizure precautions, withdrawal precautions, heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis, bowel regularity, and PPI for alcohol use. The patient's code status is full, and communication with the wife and patient has been established.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal Seizures: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and the presence of withdrawal symptoms suggest a risk for recurrent seizures.
2. Liver Disease: The elevated bilirubin levels and history of alcohol abuse indicate potential liver damage, which can lead to complications such as cirrhosis or liver failure.
3. Esophageal Stricture: The patient's recent dilatation of esophageal stricture suggests a history of esophageal inflammation or injury, which may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a past medical history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures. He presented with likely withdrawal seizures and is currently in the ICU. His current condition includes agitation, confusion, and orientation issues. The patient has been given Valium for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and is tolerating oral intake without seizures. Physical examination reveals a hematoma and ecchymosis over the right eye with limited vision due to swelling and discharge. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although he has a slightly elevated heart rate. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, while other values are within normal ranges. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures, which increases the risk of further seizures or progression to status epilepticus.
2. Infection: The presence of a hematoma and ecchymosis over the right eye, along with elevated white blood cell count, may indicate a potential infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
3. Liver disease: The elevated bilirubin level suggests underlying liver disease, possibly related to the patient's history of alcohol abuse. Further assessment and monitoring of liver function are required.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient exhibits mild thrombocytopenia, which could be a result of alcohol-induced bone marrow suppression or other underlying conditions. Regular monitoring of platelet levels is essential"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures. He presents with likely withdrawal seizures. His mental status changes are likely due to alcohol withdrawal, but other etiologies are being assessed. The patient has a negative ETOH screen, but there is an unclear history. An outpatient EEG is recommended for further evaluation. The patient is receiving diazepam and ativan using the CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and seizure precautions.

The patient has a long history of alcohol abuse. He is being administered thiamine, folate, MVI, and will receive a consult for social work and addiction services. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is also given due to alcohol use.

The patient's elevated bilirubin is likely secondary to underlying liver disease from alcohol use. He has mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A repeat HCT will be performed later in the afternoon, and there are no clear signs of bleeding.

The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now, receiving IV fluids for hydration. His electrolytes will be checked, and he will be repleted if necessary.

Seizure precautions, withdrawal precautions, heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis, bowel regimen, and PPI are also being implemented. The patient's code status is full.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures. He presented with likely withdrawal seizures and mental status changes. He has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/84 to 92/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination shows a thin, malnourished male with a hematoma and ecchymosis over the right eye, which is swollen and shut. The patient has limited vision due to swelling and discharge but can open his eye. His pupils are reactive and equal. He has distant heart sounds with a soft RRR SEM. His lungs are clear, and his abdomen is soft with no tenderness. He has no external injuries.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count, elevated bilirubin level, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies are pending.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Seizures: The patient had two witnessed seizures at home, and it is likely that alcohol withdrawal is the cause. However, other etiologies are being assessed, and an outpatient EEG is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures. He presented with likely withdrawal seizures and mental status changes, which are likely due to alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been started on diazepam and ativan for CIWA scale management. Seizure precautions have also been implemented.

The patient has a long history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing symptoms related to this condition, including elevated bilirubin levels, mild thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Thiamine, folate, and MVI supplements have been given to address these deficiencies. Social work and addiction consultation have been requested.

The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now, with IV fluids for hydration. Electrolytes will be monitored and repleted as needed. Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis prevention, bowel regularity, and stress ulcer prophylaxis due to alcohol use.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alcohol Withdrawal Seizures: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, and it is crucial to continue monitoring for any signs of seizures and provide appropriate seizure precautions.

2. Liver Disease: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels suggest underlying liver disease from alcohol abuse. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and assessment for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy should be considered.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has mild thromboc"
