   Assessment and Plan
   63yoM IDDM, CAD, CKD (baseline Cr unclear)  transferred from OSH with
   1.5 months of urticaria and ?angioedema suspected from insulin
   preparations, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for allergy and endocrine consultation
   for insulin desensitization.
   1. Rash: Multiple etiologies considered including insulin allergy vs
   allergic/rheumatologic phenomenom vs celiac sprue with dermatitis
   herpetiformes.   Time relationship between insulin administration and
   rash worsening is definitely concerning for insulin causing this
   process but still seems strange to develop suddenly after many months
   use and this is a rare phenomenom.  Endocrinology, allergy, and
   dermatology have all been consulted and are involved in his care.
   Studies pending for various other etiologies.  RPR negative.
   -F/U TTG Ab, HIV, C3 esterase deficiencies and other studies
   -F/U endocrine, dermatology, and allergy reccs (endo and allergy
   discussing insulin desens regimens)
   -Possible insulin desensitization regimen per endo and allergy
   2. DM/Hyperglycemia:  After presenting with glucoses >400 patient
   BG
s are now under better control.   Given his repeat incidents of
   hyperglycemia he does need some coverage.  Per the recommendations of
   endocrine he will be started on glyburide 5 mg PO BID and we will
   attempt to hold glucose as tolerated until we can obtain novalog (a
   formulation he has not yet received).
   - IgG/IgE insulin antibodies, protamine antibodies
   - diabetic diet, minimal carbs/glucose
   3. Low TSH: T4 normal, we will continue to monitor
   4. Cad/Htn: Continue metoprolol on home dose and clopidogrel.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of insulin allergy, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The patient presented with urticaria and suspected angioedema related to insulin preparations. He was admitted to the ICU for allergy and endocrine consultation for insulin desensitization. The patient has been experiencing a worsening rash that is temporally associated with insulin administration, leading to concerns about a possible insulin allergy. Multiple etiologies for the rash have been considered, including insulin allergy, allergic/rheumatologic phenomenon, and celiac sprue with dermatitis herpetiformis. Endocrinology, allergy, and dermatology services have been consulted and involved in the patient's care. Additional studies are pending to investigate other potential causes. The patient's blood glucose levels were initially very high (>400) but are now under better control. Due to repeated incidents of hyperglycemia, the patient will be started on glyburide 5 mg PO BID and will attempt to hold glucose as tolerated until novalog can be obtained. Other ongoing assessments and plans include monitoring for low TSH levels, managing CAD/HTN, hyperlipidemia, diverticulitis/ulcerative colitis, and providing prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient is currently receiving nutrition through the enteral route, and efforts are being made to establish more peripheral access. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU."

 HYPERGLYCEMIA
   63yoM IDDM, cad, cri transferred from OSH with 1.5 months of urticaria
   and ?angioedema, likely from insulin preparations, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   allergy and endocrine consultation for insulin desensitization.
      Although transfer for desensitization, given pt had been on insulin
   for >10 months prior to symptoms (even though reports suggest clinical
   signs worsen after administration of insulin), differential should be
   expanded to include medication effects, infectious cause, or
   vasculitiditis.
      His lisinopril was started >1yr prior and now discontinued for 2
   days and continues to have a rash.  He has been on metoprolol for
   years, as well as asacol for his UC.  He completed a 21d course of
   doxycycline in [**Month (only) 1143**] for a tick-borne illness, even though
   serologies were negative as per patient.
      Pt lives on [**Location (un) 1446**] and has some risk factors for tick-borne
   disease, although this would not be the season for such illnesses.  He
   did recently complete a 21d course of doxycycline for presumed Lyme's
   disease.  Pt does complain of palmar ""rash"" and does have a hx of std
   and does have some risk factors for STDs currently, prompting for
   consideration of syphillis, hiv, and RMSP/lyme/erlichiosis.  Hepatitis
   sequelae, such as cryoglobulinemia or PAN, should also be considered,
   although not likely given normal lfts.
      Systemically, patient lacks arthritic complaints, sinus issues or
   other suggestion of vasculidites.  His family hx does not suggest a
   familial component of a rheum cause.  If above work-up (-), should
   consider rheum work-up.
   1.  hyperglycemia/insulin desensitization: glucoses >500, +ketones in
   serum.  Despite risk for further allergic rxns, need to tx with insulin
   for goal <250.
   - novolin ss (rather than humalog) w/iv benadryl
   - IgG/IgE insulin antibodies, protamine antibodies
   - email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tonight, pharmacy/endocrinology planning for
   desensitization in AM
   - diabetic diet, minimal carbs/glucose
   - IVF 100cc/hr, UOP monitoring given CRI
    2. urticaria/rash: differential as above, likely urticaria [**12-29**] to
   allergy to insulin or preparation, medication, or idiopathic
   urticaria.
   - rpr, hiv, lfts, total protein, UA, urine protein (hep serologies,
   cryocrit if abnormal lfts)
   - ttg IgA - ?dermatitis herpetiformis in association with celiac sprue
   - will assess for appropriate complement deficiency for serologic
   assessment for angioedema
   3. low tsh: assess with free T4 here
   4. cad/htn: had been on lisinopril as outpt, started in recent months.
   Plan per [**Hospital3 474**] was to discontinue this medication as possible
   inciting factor in presentation.  Will monitor MAPs while in ICU.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU for allergy and endocrine consultation due to suspected insulin allergy. The patient has been experiencing urticaria and angioedema for the past 1.5 months, which are likely caused by insulin preparations.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 108/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. His physical examination reveals a well-nourished, overweight/obese appearance with warm skin and a rash on his chest, arms, legs, and back.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels of 214 mg/dL and 365 mg/dL, as well as elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of lisinopril use, which was discontinued due to suspected allergic reaction. He also has a history of metoprolol use for hypertension and asacol for ulcerative colitis.

   urticaria and ?angioedema, likely from insulin preparations, admitted
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for allergy and endocrine consultation for insulin
   desensitization.
   #Urticaria/Rash: DDX includes med allergy (insulin, etc), infectious
   cause (STD, tick-borne illness), vasculitis, UC, HIV, or idiopathic.
   Most likely due to insulin allergy, but broad differential must be
   entertained.
   - F/U labs for above
   - F/U insulin Ab IgG/IgE testing
   - Follow with endocrine, allergy, and pharmacy
   - Derm consult
   - Limit any potential alergens (latex free room, etc)
   # Insulin desensitization:.
   - Desensitization per endocrine/allergy/pharmacy
   - Can try IV insulin with different carrier/formulation
   - Look into pump options so pt has constant exposure to decrease anergy
   #DM/Hyperglycemia: + Ketones with allergy to insulin
   - Glyburide/Novolog in interim
   - Diabetic diet, minimal carbs/glucose
   - IVF 100cc/hr, UOP monitoring

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old individual with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). They were admitted to the hospital with a 1.5-month history of urticaria and suspected angioedema, likely caused by an allergy to insulin preparations. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for allergy and endocrine consultations for insulin desensitization.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Urticaria/Rash: The patient has been experiencing urticaria and a rash, which could be due to a medication allergy (insulin), infectious cause (STD or tick-borne illness), vasculitis, ulcerative colitis (UC), HIV, or idiopathic reasons. The most likely cause is an insulin allergy, but other possibilities should be considered.

2. Insulin Desensitization: The patient requires insulin desensitization due to the allergy to insulin preparations. This involves working with endocrine, allergy, and pharmacy teams to gradually introduce insulin and find a carrier/formulation that the patient can tolerate. Alternative options such as subcutaneous insulin or insulin pump therapy may also be considered.

3. DM/Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus and is experiencing hyperglycemia with ketones present. In the interim, the patient may be given oral antidiabetic medications like glyburide"

   Assessment and Plan
   63yoM IDDM, cad, cri transferred from OSH with 1.5 months of urticaria
   and ?angioedema, likely from insulin preparations, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   allergy and endocrine consultation for insulin desensitization.
      Although transfer for desensitization, given pt had been on insulin
   for >10 months prior to symptoms (even though reports suggest clinical
   signs worsen after administration of insulin), differential should be
   expanded to include medication effects, infectious cause, or
   vasculitiditis.
      His lisinopril was started >1yr prior and now discontinued for 2
   days and continues to have a rash.  He has been on metoprolol for
   years, as well as asacol for his UC.  He completed a 21d course of
   doxycycline in [**Month (only) 1143**] for a tick-borne illness, even though
   serologies were negative as per patient.
      Pt lives on [**Location (un) 1446**] and has some risk factors for tick-borne
   disease, although this would not be the season for such illnesses.  He
   did recently complete a 21d course of doxycycline for presumed Lyme's
   disease.  Pt does complain of palmar ""rash"" and does have a hx of std
   and does have some risk factors for STDs currently, prompting for
   consideration of syphillis, hiv, and RMSP/lyme/erlichiosis.  Hepatitis
   sequelae, such as cryoglobulinemia or PAN, should also be considered,
   although not likely given normal lfts.
      Systemically, patient lacks arthritic complaints, sinus issues or
   other suggestion of vasculidites.  His family hx does not suggest a
   familial component of a rheum cause.  If above work-up (-), should
   consider rheum work-up.
   1.  hyperglycemia/insulin desensitization: glucoses >500, +ketones in
   serum.  Despite risk for further allergic rxns, need to tx with insulin
   for goal <250.

   allergy to insulin or preparation, medication, or idiopathic
   urticaria.
   - rpr, hiv, lfts, total protein, UA, urine protein (hep serologies,

He presented to the hospital with 1.5 months of urticaria and possible angioedema, which is suspected to be caused by an allergy to insulin preparations.

   Assessment and Plan
   63yoM IDDM, CAD, CRI, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with 1.5 months of
   urticaria and ?angioedema, likely from insulin preparations, admitted
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for allergy and endocrine consultation for insulin
   desensitization.
   #Urticaria/Rash: DDX includes med allergy (insulin, etc), infectious
   cause (STD, tick-borne illness), vasculidity, hepatitis sequelae, UC.
      Although transfer for desensitization, given pt had been on insulin
   for >10 months prior to symptoms (even though reports suggest clinical
   signs worsen after administration of insulin), differential should be
   expanded to include medication effects, infectious cause, or
   vasculitiditis.
      His lisinopril was started >1yr prior and now discontinued for 2
   days and continues to have a rash.  He has been on metoprolol for
   years, as well as asacol for his UC.  He completed a 21d course of
   doxycycline in [**Month (only) 1143**] for a tick-borne illness, even though
   serologies were negative as per patient.
      Pt lives on [**Location (un) 1446**] and has some risk factors for tick-borne
   disease, although this would not be the season for such illnesses.  He
   did recently complete a 21d course of doxycycline for presumed Lyme's
   disease.  Pt does complain of palmar ""rash"" and does have a hx of std
   and does have some risk factors for STDs currently, prompting for
   consideration of syphillis, hiv, and RMSP/lyme/erlichiosis.  Hepatitis
   sequelae, such as cryoglobulinemia or PAN, should also be considered,
   although not likely given normal lfts.
      Systemically, patient lacks arthritic complaints, sinus issues or
   other suggestion of vasculidites.  His family hx does not suggest a
   familial component of a rheum cause.  If above work-up (-), should
   consider rheum work-up.
   1.  hyperglycemia/insulin desensitization: glucoses >500, +ketones in
   serum.  Despite risk for further allergic rxns, need to tx with insulin
   for goal <250.
   - novolin ss (rather than humalog) w/iv benadryl
   - IgG/IgE insulin antibodies, protamine antibodies
   - email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tonight, pharmacy/endocrinology planning for
   desensitization in AM
   - diabetic diet, minimal carbs/glucose
   - IVF 100cc/hr, UOP monitoring given CRI
    2. urticaria/rash: differential as above, likely urticaria [**12-29**] to
   allergy to insulin or preparation, medication, or idiopathic
   urticaria.
   - rpr, hiv, lfts, total protein, UA, urine protein (hep serologies,

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and urticaria. He was admitted to the ICU for allergy and endocrine consultation for insulin desensitization due to suspected angioedema caused by insulin preparations. The patient has been on various medications including lisinopril, metoprolol, asacol, and doxycycline.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/67 mmHg to 131/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient has a rash, described as urticaria, which is likely due to an allergy to insulin or its preparation. Other possible causes include infectious causes such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), vasculitis, hepatitis sequelae, or ulcerative colitis (UC). The patient has a history of UC and has been on asacol for it.

Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), but they are within normal limits. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is slightly elevated. Imaging and microbi"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old individual with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). They were admitted to the ICU for allergy and endocrine consultation due to suspected insulin allergy causing urticaria and angioedema. The patient is currently undergoing insulin desensitization treatment. They also have hyperglycemia with ketones present, possibly due to an allergy to insulin. The patient's condition remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted changes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Anaphylaxis: Due to the known allergy to insulin, there is a risk of anaphylactic reactions if exposed to the allergen.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes management is complicated by an allergy to insulin, which may lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels.
3. Infection: The presence of urticaria and rash could potentially indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, and any imbalances may contribute to complications such as electrolyte disturbances or organ dysfunction.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to their immobility in the ICU, and prophylaxis measures are in place.

   #Urticaria/Rash: DDX includes med allergy (insulin, etc), infectious
   cause (STD, tick-borne illness), vasculitis, UC, HIV, or idiopathic.
   Most likely due to insulin allergy, but broad differential must be
   entertained.
   - F/U labs for above
   - F/U insulin Ab IgG/IgE testing
   - Follow with endocrine, allergy, and pharmacy
   - Derm consult
   - Limit any potential alergens (latex free room, etc)
   # Insulin desensitization:.
   - Desensitization per endocrine/allergy/pharmacy
   - Can try IV insulin with different carrier/formulation
   - Look into pump options so pt has constant exposure to decrease anergy

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old individual with a medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). They were admitted to the ICU for allergy and endocrine consultation for insulin desensitization due to suspected allergy to insulin preparations, which may have caused urticaria and angioedema. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature within normal range, blood pressure slightly low, respiratory rate normal, and oxygen saturation at 94%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable vital signs with a heart rate of 65 bpm.
- Fluid balance indicates an intake of 880 mL and 960 mL over the past 24 hours, with outputs totaling 600 mL and 600 mL.
- The patient is receiving various medications including insulin, antibiotics, and other ICU medications.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the presence of urticaria/rash.
- Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and urticarial rash on the extremities.
- Neurologic examination is not assessed.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. Blood glucose levels are elevated.
- Imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels suggest uncontrolled diabetes. Insulin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old individual with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and allergies to insulin preparations. The patient was admitted to the hospital with 1.5 months of urticaria and possible angioedema. They were transferred from another hospital for allergy and endocrine consultation for insulin desensitization.

The patient's main complaints include urticaria and potential angioedema, which are suspected to be caused by insulin allergy. The differential diagnosis includes medication allergy, infectious causes, vasculitis, ulcerative colitis (UC), HIV, or idiopathic factors. The patient has shown tolerance to Novolog with pre-treatment of benadryl.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/79 mmHg to 113/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and their extremities are 2+ bilaterally.

Lab results indicate elevated glucose levels, with a range of 146 mg/dL to 365 mg/dL. Other notable lab findings include elevated white blood cell count, slightly reduced hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Liver enzymes and kidney function tests are within normal ranges"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He was admitted to the hospital with a 1.5-month history of urticaria and suspected angioedema, possibly due to insulin allergy. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he is undergoing insulin desensitization and receiving treatment for hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Allergic reaction to insulin: The patient has a known allergy to insulin, which could lead to an allergic reaction or angioedema. Close monitoring and desensitization are necessary.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): With the patient's history of IDDM and current hyperglycemia, there is a risk of DKA. Monitoring blood glucose levels and ketone presence is crucial.
3. Infection: Given the patient's compromised immune system due to diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency, he is at an increased risk of infections. Regular assessment of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As a precautionary measure, the patient is on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent the development of DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis due to his critical condition and potential risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia ("
