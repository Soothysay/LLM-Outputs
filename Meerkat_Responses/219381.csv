   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. known to MICU service for recent MICU admission for hypotension -->
   attributed predominately to hypovolemia.  Improved with iv hydration,
   and transferred to medical [**Hospital1 **] [**2190-12-4**].  Encephalopathy noted and
   persisted.
   Since transfer to medical [**Hospital1 **], developed resp. distress and hypoxemia
   last PM --> attributed to CHF, with only mild improvement in dyspnea
   with diuretic, but required increased supplimental oxygen.  Persistent
   symptoms promted  ABG= 7.30/32/43 and relative hypotension -->
   transferred to MICU service for further evaluation and managment.
   In MICU states to feel improved, using 100% non-rebreather mask.
   States breathing is easier.

   Imaging: CXR ([**2190-12-7**]) diffuse patchy bilateral nodular infiltrates
   Assessment and Plan
   Pneumonia, multilobar (aspiration) and possible component CHF
   (systolic).
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- multifactorial; suspect predominately
   attributed to pneumonia, probable aspiration (encephalopathy as risk
   factor).  Also consider contribution of CHF (in context of elevated
   BNP).  Monitor RR, SaO2, maintain SaO2 >90%.  Low threshold for
   intubation.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to diffuse bilateral pulmonary process.
   Improved with increased FiO2 and empirical diuretics.  Susupect
   predominately pneumonia, although cannot exclude component of CHF.
   Monitor SaO2.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect infection, probable aspiration
   pneuomonia, although concern for opportunistic infection (such as
   PcP).  [**Month (only) 11**] be contribution of pulmonary edema in setting of
   cardiomyopahty and elevated BNP.  Empirical antibiotics.  Consider IS
   for PcP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1743**].  Await cultures.
   HYPOTENSION -- relative hypotension.  [**Name2 (NI) 11**] be attributed to volume shift
   in setting of diuretics.  Also consider sepsis.  No evidence for
   bleeding.  Doubt adrenal insufficiency.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60
   mmHg.  Infection may not manifest with fever or elevated WBC in
   cirrhotic pt.
   RENAL FAILURE -- continued improvement in creatinine with iv fluid
   hydration.  Monitor i/o, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K>4.0
   CARDIOMYOPATHY -- [**Last Name (LF) 1744**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]= 25-30%.  Elevated BNP may be
   attriibuted in part to CHF.  Monitor I/O, exam.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.  Maintain balance.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider net
   diuresis (mild) if BP sufficient.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.  [**Month (only) 11**] initiate TF if
   remains aspiration risk.
   PCN ALLERGY -- avoid penicillin products.
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- hepatic.  Continue lactulose.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The patient was admitted to the MICU for hypotension attributed to hypovolemia and encephalopathy. Since the transfer to Medical [**Hospital1**], the patient developed respiratory distress and hypoxemia, which was attributed to congestive heart failure (CHF) with mild improvement in dyspnea with diuretics but required increased supplemental oxygen. The symptoms prompted an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.30, PaCO2 32 mmHg, and PaO2 43 mmHg, along with relative hypotension. The patient was then transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation and management.

In the MICU, the patient is using a 100% non-rebreather mask and states that breathing is easier. The patient has allergies to iodine, penicillins, morphine, metronidazole, allopurinol, erythromycin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on [**2190-12-7**] at 08:45 PM and aztreonam on [**2190-12-7**] at 08:47 PM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 71 bpm with a sinus rhythm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypoxemia, gastrointestinal bleed, cirrhosis of the liver, coronary artery disease, chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and cerebrovascular accident. He presents to the ICU with hypotension, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. He also has relative hypotension due to recent administration of lasix and possible sepsis. The patient has a history of esophageal varices, which may be causing the gastrointestinal bleed. He also has ulcerative colitis and has been non-compliant with his medications, resulting in a flare-up. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy or an infectious cause. He has acute on chronic renal failure and chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%. The patient has a history of multiple prior myocardial infarctions and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) revascularization. He is also on dual-chamber pacemaker for ventricular tachycardia with atrioventricular pacing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged stay in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic renal failure, and ulcerative colitis (UC). He was admitted from the floor with hypotension, hypoxia, and tachypnea. On admission, his blood pressure was 120/60 mmHg, which decreased to 95/40 mmHg after administration of lasix. He has a baseline creatinine level of 1.8-2.0, which resolved with fluid resuscitation. The patient has been on prednisone for the past month, making him susceptible to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

Assessment and Plan:

   Assessment and Plan
   Pneumonia, multilobar (aspiration) and possible component CHF
   (systolic).
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- multifactorial; suspect predominately
   attributed to pneumonia, probable aspiration (encephalopathy as risk
   factor).   Check GM and [**2-11**] glucan.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to diffuse bilateral pulmonary process.
   Improved with increased FiO2 and empirical diuretics.  Suspect
   predominately pneumonia, although cannot exclude component of CHF with
   high pro-BNP.  Monitor SaO2.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect infection, probable aspiration
   pneumonia, although concern for opportunistic infection (such as PCP).
   [**Month (only) 11**] be contribution of pulmonary edema in setting of cardiomyopathy and
   elevated BNP.  Empirical antibiotics.  Consider Induced sputum for
   PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] check nasal swab for influenza.  Await cultures. Doubt we
   are dealing with DAH at this time. [**Month (only) 11**] begin empiric PCP coverage if
   LDH is high while sputum cultures are awaited. Will begin lasix drip to
   help with fluid removal today, if needed with low dose neosynephrine.
   Will need to keep strictly NPO. Will attempt to keep TBB negative by 1
   L over next 24 hours. BiPAP to start today to help with respiratory
   distress.
   HYPOTENSION -- relative hypotension.  [**Name2 (NI) 11**] be attributed to volume shift
   in setting of diuretics.  Also consider sepsis.  No evidence for
   bleeding.  There is low adrenal reserve but will start IV
   hydrocortisone/ solumedrol given severity of ongoing stress.  Monitor
   BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Infection may not manifest with fever or
   elevated WBC in cirrhotic pt. will likely need PICC line or CVL for
   pressors if needed.
    RENAL FAILURE -- continued improvement in creatinine with iv fluid
   hydration.  Monitor i/o, BUN, creatinine. Baseline Crt 1.5-2.0.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K>4.0
   CARDIOMYOPATHY -- ischemic, EF= 25-30%.  Elevated BNP may be
   attriibuted in part to CHF.  Poor tolerability to elevated heart rate
   and Afib. Will get lasix today as BP allows. Recent echo shows severe
   LV dysfunction with features of RV dysfunction. [**Month (only) 11**] restart digoxin /
   amiodarone in 24 hours if starts to climb. Will check cardiac enzymes
   today.
   ANEMIA; ? ongoing GI losses or hemoptysis that still hasn
t been overt.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.  [**Month (only) 11**] initiate TF if
   remains aspiration risk.
   Thrombocytopenia:  Heparin on hold. Will check HIT.
   PCN ALLERGY -- avoid penicillin products.

s plan of care. He is transferred back to the ICU with hypoxemia
   respiratory distress, multifocal infiltrates and borderline blood
   pressures. He has been off diuretics for more than 48 hours by report
   and his Digoxin and amiodraone have been on hold too. There has not
   been a witnessed aspiration event but his wife does report scant
   hemoptysis. His Hct is down to 26 and BNP is greater than [**Numeric Identifier 1757**]. He has
   diffuse rales to exam with minimal edema. His presentation is
   concerning for worsening CHF vs non-cardiogenic edema from sepsis ( ?
   aspiration PNA). He will need re-institution of a lasix drip with low
   dose pressors if needed over next 24 hours. We will reinitiate digoxin
   in the short term for heart rate control too. PICC line vs CVL to be
   placed today after FFP. BiPAP will be used as a bridge if mental status
   allows for this. He and his family do not wish for an NG tube at this
   time.  He is a full code. CC time : 50 minutes

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, multilobar aspiration, and possible component CHF (systolic). The patient has respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and pulmonary infiltrates. He also has relative hypotension, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is NPO pending evaluation and will require nutritional support if needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory distress and sepsis.
2. Aspiration: The patient's risk factors for aspiration include encephalopathy and possible component CHF. Aspiration can result in pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac dysfunction may lead to cardiogenic shock, characterized by low blood pressure and poor tissue perfusion.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient has renal failure, and further deterioration of kidney function can occur due to inadequate fluid management or sepsis.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic dysfunction may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and confusion.
6. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, especially if he requires invasive procedures or medications that affect clotting.
7. Malnutrition: Being NPO, the patient is at risk of malnutrition, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia and possible component congestive heart failure (CHF). The respiratory distress is multifactorial, with pneumonia being the predominant cause, although CHF cannot be excluded. The patient's hypoxemia has improved with increased FiO2 and empirical diuretics.

The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates, which are suspected to be due to infection, probable aspiration pneumonia, and concern for opportunistic infection such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). There is a contribution of pulmonary edema in the setting of cardiomyopathy and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Empirical antibiotics have been started, and consideration is being given to induced sputum for PCP. Nasal swab for influenza is also being checked.

The patient is hypotensive, with relative hypotension attributed to volume shift in the setting of diuretics. There is low adrenal reserve, and IV hydrocortisone/solumedrol has been started given the severity of ongoing stress. The patient's renal function has shown continued improvement with IV fluid hydration, and close monitoring of intake/output, BUN, and creatinine is being done. The patient's potassium levels are being monitored and repleted if necessary.

The patient has cardiomyopathy with ischemic changes, an ejection fraction of 25-30%, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pneumonia, multilobar (aspiration) and possible component CHF
   (systolic).
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- multifactorial; suspect predominately
   attributed to pneumonia, probable aspiration (encephalopathy as risk
   factor).  Also consider contribution of CHF (in context of elevated
   BNP).  Monitor RR, SaO2, maintain SaO2 >90%.  Low threshold for
   intubation.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to diffuse bilateral pulmonary process.
   Improved with increased FiO2 and empirical diuretics.  Susupect
   predominately pneumonia, although cannot exclude component of CHF.
   Monitor SaO2.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect infection, probable aspiration
   pneuomonia, although concern for opportunistic infection (such as
   PcP).  [**Month (only) 11**] be contribution of pulmonary edema in setting of
   cardiomyopahty and elevated BNP.  Empirical antibiotics.  Consider IS
   for PcP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1743**].  Await cultures.
   HYPOTENSION -- relative hypotension.  [**Name2 (NI) 11**] be attributed to volume shift
   in setting of diuretics.  Also consider sepsis.  No evidence for
   bleeding.  Doubt adrenal insufficiency.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60
   mmHg.  Infection may not manifest with fever or elevated WBC in
   cirrhotic pt.
   RENAL FAILURE -- continued improvement in creatinine with iv fluid
   hydration.  Monitor i/o, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K>4.0
   CARDIOMYOPATHY -- [**Last Name (LF) 1744**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]= 25-30%.  Elevated BNP may be
   attriibuted in part to CHF.  Monitor I/O, exam.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.  Maintain balance.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider net
   diuresis (mild) if BP sufficient.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.  [**Month (only) 11**] initiate TF if
   remains aspiration risk.
   PCN ALLERGY -- avoid penicillin products.
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- hepatic.  Continue lactulose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who was recently admitted to the MICU for hypotension and is now in the ICU. He has been intubated and underwent bronchoscopy. The patient's current concerns include multifocal pneumonia (HAP vs PCP vs fungal), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF 20%), and chronic steroid use. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and sedation with propofol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia (HAP vs PCP vs fungal): The patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic steroid use puts him at risk for various types of infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and fungal infections. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath is essential, and appropriate cultures and imaging studies should be performed to guide treatment.

2. Heart failure: The patient has an EF of 20%, indicating systolic dysfunction, which can lead to heart failure. Symptoms may include dyspnea, edema, and fatigue. Diuretics and other medications to improve cardiac function should be continued, and the patient's fluid status should be closely monitored.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was recently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and is now readmitted with progressive respiratory failure. He is intubated and bronchoscoped. The patient has multiple comorbidities including heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF 20%), new multifocal pneumonia (PNA), and possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) given his history of chronic steroid use. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal PNA: The patient is at risk for further respiratory complications due to the presence of multiple lung infiltrates seen on imaging. This may lead to worsening respiratory failure and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. PCP: Given the patient's history of chronic steroid use, there is a concern for PCP, which can cause severe respiratory distress and could potentially worsen his current respiratory failure.
3. Heart failure: The patient has systolic dysfunction with an EF of 20%. This places him at risk for further cardiac deterioration and decompensation, potentially leading to cardiogenic shock.
4. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis may progress, leading to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased"

2. Multifocal PNA: The patient has a concern for multiple lung infections, including bacterial, fungal, or PCP. This is indicated by the presence of crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally and elevated white blood cell count.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (20%). This is supported by the presence of bilateral crackles, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and an echocardiogram showing systolic dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 71-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation (Afib), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and previous ICU admission for hypotension.
- Currently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with progressive respiratory failure.
- Intubated on [**12-8**] and underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
- Concern for multifocal pneumonia (PNA) including possibilities of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or fungal infection.
- Additional component of heart failure with systolic dysfunction (EF 20%).
- Current treatment includes antibiotics (Aztreonam, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin), diuretics, and sedation with propofol.
- Plan to continue pending culture data, wean FiO2, maintain PEEP at 8, perform non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, place arterial line, and check triglycerides.
- Cirrhosis etiology unclear, considering endoscopy with placement of nasogastric (OG) tube.
- Glucose control to be achieved through intravenous insulin with a goal of 110-150 mg/dL.
- Renal failure indicated by increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note, but it can be inferred that the patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern.

The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. They have undergone a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from the right upper lobe, which showed 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes without organisms. The patient also has a history of varices and cirrhosis with unclear etiology.

The patient's allergies include iodine, penicillins, morphine, metronidazole, allopurinol, erythromycin, tetracycline, Septra, and ramipril. The last doses of antibiotics administered were levofloxacin, vancomycin, and aztreonam.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions including propofol, phenylephrine, and furosemide. Other medications include insulin for glycemic control and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/65 mmHg to 134/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight is currently 78 kg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis, coronary artery disease, and ulcerative colitis, presenting with hypotension, hypoxia, and tachypnea. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, chronic systolic heart failure, multifocal pneumonia, and GI bleed. The patient is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, and acute on chronic renal failure. He has a past medical history of multiple myocardial infarctions, CABG revascularization, atrial fibrillation, and a cerebrovascular accident. The patient's current medications include digoxin, IV solumedrol, lasix, ursodiol, and an insulin drip.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated for a combination of CHF and multifocal pneumonia. If the pneumonia does not improve or if the patient develops further complications, respiratory failure may occur.
2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has an ejection fraction of 20-25% and is at risk for worsening heart failure. This can lead to further fluid accumulation and pulmonary edema.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient's chest CT shows bilateral multifocal peri-bronchovascular consolidation and ground-glass opacity, which is consistent with multifocal pneumonia. If the infection does not respond to treatment or if the patient develops new symptoms, the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis, coronary artery disease, chronic systolic heart failure, renal artery stenosis, type II diabetes mellitus, and ulcerative colitis. He presented to the hospital with hypotension, hypoxia, and tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including respiratory failure, chronic systolic heart failure, multifocal pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, acute on chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for underlying infection or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. There is a risk of worsening heart failure symptoms and fluid overload.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has diffuse infiltrates and ground-glass opacities on chest imaging, raising suspicion for fungal or viral infection. Fungal cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are pending.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to heparin-induced"

   bronched. Concern for now for multifocal PNA (HAP vs PCP vs fungal)
   with an additional component of heart failure.
   >Respiratory failure: multiple contributing factors including heart
   failure with systolic dysfunction (EF 20%) and new likely multifocal
   PNA (PCP neg in BAL, awaiting 1,3gluc and GM for fungal)
   -current treatment includes and will cont despite neg clx data. Will
   plan for 14 day course.
   Aztreonam [**12-7**] for all
   Vancomycin trough 20.8 [**12-9**] (PM)

   - diuresis with goal net out 1L using phenylephrine goal MAP of 60
   mmHg. Lytes in the afternoon with Mg>2 and K>4. Restart aldactone when
   OG tube in place.
   - SBT on [**6-14**] for now. Check ABG after 1hr.
   - Non con CT scan of the chest reveals interstitial and alveolar
   infiltrates concerning for edema, possibly interstitial PNA or possibly
   hemorrhage. Small effusions with perihepatic ascites.
   - sedation with propofol check triglycerides
   >Stage IV Cirrhosis: unclear etiology possibly [**3-13**] PSC in the setting
   of UC vs auto immune process, ? drop in Hct related to variceal bleed,
   plan for endoscopy with placement of OG tube.
   -Will plan to restart  Lactulose when he has oral access.
   >Glucose control: convert to IV insulin, goal 110-150 mg/dL
   >Renal failure: increased BUN, FEUrea > 35%. Diuresis goal as above
   >Heart failure: appreciate cards input.
   -  As above and utilizing IV digoxin (with dose reduction)  for
   A-fibrillation and contractility.
   -Diuresis as above. Appreciate cards input.
   Thrombocytopenia: Improving, doesn

","The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was recently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and is now readmitted with progressive respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and bronchodilated. There is concern for multifocal pneumonia (PNA) with an additional component of heart failure.

The patient's current treatment includes aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, steroids, diuretics, and phenylephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg. The goal is to achieve a net output of 1 liter of fluid. Magnesium and potassium levels should be monitored, and aldactone will be restarted once the orogastric (OG) tube is in place. A sedation holiday with propofol will be considered, and triglycerides should be checked. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest reveals interstitial and alveolar infiltrates concerning for edema, possibly interstitial PNA or possibly hemorrhage. Small effusions with perihepatic ascites are also present.

The patient has stage IV cirrhosis with an unclear etiology, possibly primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was previously admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and is now readmitted with progressive respiratory failure. He required intubation on 12-8 and bronchoscopy.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, heart failure with systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 20%), and a suspected multifocal pneumonia (PNA) with an additional component of heart failure. The PNA may be caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or fungal infection, as indicated by negative PCP in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and awaiting results for 1,3-beta-D-glucan (a fungal marker) and galactomannan (a marker for invasive fungal infections).

The patient's treatment includes aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, steroids, diuretics, phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg, and sedation with propofol. FiO2 weaning and PEEP at 8 are planned.

The patient also has stage IV cirrhosis, possibly related to primary sclerosing"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old man with a complex medical history, including ulcerative colitis (UC), cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was recently admitted to the MICU for hypotension and is now in the ICU for progressive respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and bronched.

The assessment and plan indicate concern for multifocal pneumonia (PNA), including the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or fungal infection. There is also an additional component of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%.

Current treatment includes aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, steroids, diuresis with phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg, and electrolyte management. Sedation with propofol is being used, and a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest reveals interstitial and alveolar infiltrates concerning for edema, possibly interstitial PNA or possibly hemorrhage. Small effusions with perihepatic ascites are also noted.

The patient has stage IV cirrhosis with unclear etiology, possibly primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in the setting of UC or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis, coronary artery disease, ulcerative colitis, chronic systolic heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents to the ICU with hypotension, hypoxia, and tachypnea. His past medical history includes esophageal varices, myocardial infarction, and CABG, as well as a cerebrovascular accident.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, chronic systolic heart failure, multifocal pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status, ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, and acute on chronic renal failure. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being paced.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further deterioration in respiratory function due to underlying conditions such as chronic heart failure and multifocal pneumonia.
2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen, leading to fluid accumulation and decreased cardiac output.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress, causing increased difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of esophageal varices and ulcerative colitis, both of which"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia and congestive heart failure. The patient has been receiving diuretics and antibiotics, and there has been improvement in hypoxemia and respiratory failure. The patient is ready for extubation today.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure - improved with diuretics and antibiotics. Ready for extubation today.
2. Heart failure - as above, diuresed well yesterday, target blood pressure (TBB) even today. Continue digoxin and hold ACE inhibitor (ACEI) due to renal function deterioration.
3. Renal failure, acute - slight bump in creatinine today due to diuretic use. Repeat electrolytes and creatinine in the evening, holding ACEI.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II - discharge from continuous zinc insulin (CZI) drip, follow-up fasting serum (FS) today, transition to NPH.
5. Hypotension - resolved, now off neo. Improved, hold ACEI today and follow-up blood pressure.
6. Gastrointestinal bleed, lower - continue to decrease steroids and transition to home prednisone dose when able to take orally. Continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and hold anticoagulation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation (Afib), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient was readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with progressive respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia (PNA) and congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has improved with diuresis and antibiotics. He is ready for extubation today.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia has also improved with diuresis and antibiotics.
3. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-30% and moderate MR. Diuresis was well-tolerated yesterday, and the goal is to maintain a target blood pressure (TBB) today. Digoxin will continue, and ACE inhibitors will be held due to a slight bump in creatinine (Cr).
4. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): There is a slight bump in Cr today in the setting of diuresis. Repeat labs including electrolytes and Cr should be done in the afternoon. ACE inhibitors will be held today"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis, coronary artery disease, chronic systolic heart failure, ulcerative colitis, and cerebrovascular accident. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, hypoxia, and tachypnea. The patient's current medications include digoxin, heparin, lasix, and prednisone.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, chronic systolic heart failure, multifocal pneumonia, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, acute on chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being treated as a combination of congestive heart failure (CHF) and the possibility of multifocal pneumonia. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and diuresed well on lasix drip. Oxygenation has improved since extubation.

2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He is on digoxin and lasix. Daily weights and I/Os are being strictly monitored, and lisinopril is being held in the setting of hypotension. Hydralazine is being added for afterload reduction.

3. Multifocal Pneumonia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis, coronary disease, and chronic systolic heart failure. He presents with hypotension, hypoxia, and tachypnea. The patient has been treated for respiratory failure, chronic systolic heart failure, multifocal pneumonia, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, GI bleed, hepatic encephalopathy, ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, acute on chronic renal failure, CAD, atrial fibrillation, CVA, DM2, and electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure due to underlying conditions such as chronic heart failure and multifocal pneumonia.
2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. This condition can lead to further decompensation and worsening heart failure symptoms.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for multifocal pneumonia, which can potentially progress or lead to complications like sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can be attributed to sepsis or heart failure. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent further hypotension and its associated complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing,"

The patient's recent events include extubation, advancing diet, tapering steroids, discontinuing insulin, adjusting Vancomycin dosing, changing CVL, and switching medications from IV to PO.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated for a combination of congestive heart failure (CHF) and multifocal pneumonia (PNA). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient is being diuresed with Lasix.

2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. Daily weights and I/Os are being strictly monitored, and the patient is on Lasix as needed. Lisinopril has been withheld due to hypotension, and digoxin IV is being continued.

3. Multifocal PNA: Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Aztreonam, due to the patient's penicillin allergy. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is pending, and PCP is negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxemia believed to be due to CHF and multifocal pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been extubated and is currently on nasal cannula with good oxygen saturation.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Respiratory Failure - The patient likely has respiratory failure due to CHF and multifocal PNA. The patient is doing well on nasal cannula, and the plan is to wean off oxygen as tolerated.

2. Heart Failure - The patient has systolic heart failure with moderate mitral regurgitation. The plan includes initiating afterload reduction with hydralazine and holding ACE inhibitors until creatinine levels stabilize. The patient should resume home lasix and possibly resume spironolactone in a few days.

3. Acute Renal Failure - The patient has acute renal failure with baseline creatinine of 1.8, likely due to pre-renal or mild acute tubular necrosis with hypertonicity. The creatinine levels are trending back down, and the ACE inhibitors should be continued to be held. The patient's electrolytes and creatinine levels should be followed closely.

4. Type II Diabetes Mellitus - The patient's fasting blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, congestive heart failure (CHF) with moderate mitral regurgitation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, specifically worsening hypoxemia believed to be caused by CHF and multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been extubated and is tolerating oral intake well. 

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial condition was respiratory failure, likely due to CHF and multifocal pneumonia. He is currently doing well on nasal cannula oxygen and will continue to have his oxygen weaned as tolerated.

2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with moderate mitral regurgitation. He is being initiated on afterload reduction with hydralazine and will resume home lasix (possibly aldactone in a few days). ACE inhibitors will be restarted when creatinine levels stabilize.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal causes or mild acute tubular necrosis with hypertonicity. His creatinine levels are trending downward, and ACE inhibitors will be held until renal function improves.

4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has elevated fasting blood sugar levels despite excellent oral intake. He will be titrating NPH insulin to 12 units at [Hospital1], maintaining a NCS diet, and continuing SSI coverage. Steroids will be tapered off.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient continues to be paced for atrial fibrillation. Coumadin will be held for now, but may be resumed if the patient's hematocrit levels stabilize. ASA 81 mg qd will be considered.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, but is afebrile and clinically improving. The PICC site is clean, and the patient will be monitored closely for any signs of infection. Differential and culture results will be followed up.

7. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient has a history of cirrhosis. Lactulose will be continued.

8. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels remain high at 149. Liberalization of oral free water intake will be initiated.

9. Ulcerative Colitis/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and gastrointestinal bleeding. Prednisone 40 mg qd will be resumed, and the patient will be in touch with GI regarding re-initiating hydrocortisone enemas, etc.

10. ICU Care: The patient is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, SQ UF Heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The arterial line will be weaned off."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE - likely CHF and multifocal PNA, doing well on
   nasal cannula
   - will complete vanco/aztreo/levoflox (day 6 of 10)
   - change steroids to PO prednisone, taper (will clarify home baseline
   dose)
   - will keep TBB negative 500 today
   - wean O2 as tolerated
 .H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE
   - initiate afterload reduction with hydralazine 10 mg q6h with hold
   parameters until Cr recovers (ultimately ACEI to be restarted)
   - TBB negative 500 today
   - resume home lasix (possibly resume aldactone in a few days)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - baseline Cr 1.8
   - trending back down, continue to hold ACEI
   - f/u PM lytes/Cr
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II - FS remain elevated
   - will titrate NPH
   - continue SSI
 CV/AF - continues to be paced
   - resume ASA 325 mg today, will continue to hold coumadin for now,
   though Hct has been stable
 LEUKOCYTOSIS - afebrile, overall improving clinically, PICC site
   clean
   - follow fever curve closely, f/u differential
   - check C. diff, U/A
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER
   - continue lactulose
   #HYPERNATREMIA - Na remains 149
   - liberalize PO free water intake today
   #UC - tapering systemic steroids as noted above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which is likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF) and multifocal pneumonia. The patient has shown improvement, tolerating oral intake and transitioning to subcutaneous insulin.

The patient's medical history includes acute decompensated heart failure, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), leukocytosis, cirrhosis of the liver, and ulcerative colitis. The patient's current medications include SSI (likely referring to sliding scale insulin), NPH (Neutral Proximate Hypeinsulin), lactulose, ursodiol, Lipitor, solumedrol, and digoxin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/55 to 127/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. The creatinine level is within normal range, but the potassium and sodium levels are slightly elevated. The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are slightly elevated, while"
