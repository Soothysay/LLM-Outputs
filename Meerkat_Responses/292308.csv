   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83M with a PMH s/f advanced dementia, and recurrent
   aspirations, who presents with fevers in the setting of a presumed
   aspiration event, SBO, and a UTI.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Patient meets SIRS criteria with fevers, leukocytosis,
   bandemia, tachycardia, and tachypnea.  Also with signs of hypoperfusion
   with elevated lactate and transient hypotension.  Currently
   normotensive after 4L of NS.  Suspected sources are
   aspiration/health-care associated pneumonia, UTI, and thickened bowel.
   Prior cultures reveal h/o pseudomonas in the sputum, and pan-sensitive
   enterococcus in the urine.
   -Bolus NS for hypotension, will hold off on central access for now, as
   patient is normotensive.
   -zosyn for coverage of health-care associated PNA.  This will also
   cover an aspiration event and his UTI.
   -Obtain sputum cultures, will attempt to narrow coverage based on
   culture data.
   -Follow lactates
   -F/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   #. SBO: Evaluated by surgery and felt to not be a surgical candidate.
   Likely related to segment of bowel wall thickening, which could be
   infectious, ischemic, or inflammatory in nature.
   -Hold tube feeds/bowel rest
   -IVF boluses
   -NGT decompression, will maintain wall suction
   -F/u surgical recs
   -Serial abdominal exams
   -Hold bowel regimen
   .
   #. Seizure disorder: continue home regimen of phenobarb
   .
   #. Dementia: stable at baseline
   .
   #. Chronic aspiration: continue home scopolamine and nebulizers.
   .
   FEN: Bowel rest, IV maintenance fluids

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [Known lastname] is an 83-year-old male with a history of advanced dementia and recurrent aspirations. He presents with fevers, suspected aspiration event, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been given Vancomycin but experienced a morbilliform rash, so its use was discontinued. He is currently being treated with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for coverage of healthcare-associated pneumonia, aspiration event, and UTI. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/63 mmHg to 133/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a sinus rhythm and is well-nourished without acute distress. Physical examination findings are within normal limits except for absent right and left dorsalis pedis pulses. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated lactate levels. Assessment and plan include sepsis with suspected sources of infection such as aspiration, healthcare-associated pneumonia, UTI, and thickened bowel. The patient has been given fluids and antibiotics, and cultures have been obtained. Other issues include SBO, seizure disorder, dementia, and chronic aspiration. The patient's code status is full code, and he is"

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname **], an 83-year-old male with advanced dementia and recurrent aspirations, presents with fevers in the setting of a presumed aspiration event, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is not considered a surgical candidate for the SBO. His current medications include Zosyn for ileitis/HAP, Vancomycin (d/c due to morbilloform rash), and phenobarb for seizure disorder. He is also on bowel rest, IV maintenance fluids, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If not appropriately managed, it can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can lead to worsening respiratory failure and potentially develop into ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's SBO is likely related to segment of bowel wall thickening, which could be infectious, ischemic, or inflammatory in nature. If the obstruction persists or worsens, it may result in bowel ischemia and nec"

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with advanced dementia and recurrent aspirations.
- He presents with fevers, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and a urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient has been started on a PICC line, and various medications including antibiotics.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/47 mmHg to 143/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are ongoing.
- Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses, unassessed skin, and neurologic status.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood glucose levels.
- The patient is diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and small bowel obstruction.
- The plan includes continuing antibiotics for ileitis/hospital-acquired pneumonia, discontinuing vancomycin due to a morphilliform rash, further evaluation of the small bowel obstruction, and ongoing monitoring and management of other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and there is an ABG result showing hypoxemia. Close monitoring and possible mechanical ventilation may be required if the respiratory failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with advanced dementia and recurrent aspirations. He presented with fevers, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.1°C, current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.2°C, heart rate (HR) of 66 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 118/59 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 91%. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 26.1 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin (Hct) at 36.4%, elevated platelet count (Plt) at 287 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 1.2 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels. 

The patient's physical examination reveals audible secretions, weak cough, regular rhythm with normal rate, symmetrical chest expansion, no wheezes, soft abdomen with minimal distention, contracted and well-perfused extremities, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. 

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, small bowel obstruction (SBO), hypernatremia, seizure disorder, dementia, chronic aspiration, and ICU care.

   aspirations, who presents with fevers in the setting of a presumed
   aspiration event, SBO, and a UTI.
   24 Hour Events:
   - didn't get called out because requiring frequent suctioning,
   otherwirse ready to go
   - Blood cultures: [**12-27**] GPC in clusters (MRSA screen neg) - concerning as
   we had just taken off Vancomycin for rash, but continues to clinically
   improve, afebrile, leukocytosis improving.
   - Tubefeeds restarted, tolerated well
   - Hypernatremic this AM to 152 which is 3.5 L free water loss. If
   planning to correct in 1 day, would need 150ml of free water via
   feeding tube every hour - since this happened slowly, there's no rush -

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of advanced dementia and recurrent aspirations. He presents with fevers in the setting of a presumed aspiration event, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including piperacillin, tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. He also received heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/60 to 166/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated platelet count, increased creatinine level, and abnormal glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, impaired skin integrity, and no neurologic assessment due to advanced dementia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an aerosol-cool device and has a blood culture showing growth of Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is negative for MRSA.

The patient's care plan includes continued treatment with Zosyn for ileitis/H"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with advanced dementia and recurrent aspirations. He presents with fevers, presumed aspiration event, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/60 mmHg to 166/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 11,302 mL and output of 2,041 mL since 12 AM. The patient's urine output is 1,014 mL. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.1 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 115 to 174 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count of 218 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, and albumin level is 3.0 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The pneumonia is hospital-acquired and non-ventilator-associated (VAN). The respiratory failure is acute but not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient also has small bowel obstruction, likely related to segment of bowel wall thickening. Surgery evaluated the patient and determined that he is not a surgical candidate. 

The patient's hypernatremia has improved with free water boluses. He is on a regimen of home phenobarb for seizure disorder and will continue with his home regimen. His dementia is stable at baseline, and chronic aspiration will continue with home scopolamine and nebulizers.

Nutrition is being provided through Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at a rate of 60 mL/hour. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin and stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor. 

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is still pending."
