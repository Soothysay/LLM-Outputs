","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. They have undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showing a duodenal ulcer (DU) with bleeding vessel, for which two clips were placed. The patient was extubated and their hematocrit (Hct) continues to trend down. They were given an additional unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC), but the response was poor. The patient's troponin T levels continue to trend up, reaching a peak of 0.26, while their creatine kinase (CK) level peaked at 396. The patient denies chest pain or palpitations, and there are no ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for a low-grade fever overnight.

Physical examination reveals normal vital signs, including heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). The patient's cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Neurological assessment is not fully evaluated due to the patient's intubation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hb), and decreased hematocrit (Hct). The patient's potassium (K+) level is low, while their sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and magnesium (Mg++) levels are within normal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU with syncope and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and underwent endoscopic therapy for a bleeding duodenal ulcer (DU) with a bleeding vessel, where two clips were placed. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) continues to trend down, indicating ongoing blood loss despite receiving an additional unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Troponin-T levels have also increased, suggesting possible cardiac involvement. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, which may be due to the GIB or an underlying infection. The patient's blood cultures, Helicobacter pylori antibody test, and urine culture are pending. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to airway protection but has been extubated and is breathing comfortably. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 82 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 104/57 to 131/82 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) ranging from 10 to 68 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%, and temperature (Tcurrent) at 37.7°C. The patient is expected to undergo repeat upper endoscopy (EGD) in the morning.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was transferred from another hospital with syncope and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of duodenal ulcer (DU) and likely nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed a bleeding vessel in the duodenum, and two clips were placed to stop the bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) continues to trend down, indicating ongoing blood loss despite receiving an additional unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

The patient's troponin levels have increased from 0.06 to 0.26, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia or a coronary event. However, the patient does not report any chest pain, and there are no ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level peaked at 396, which may indicate muscle damage but does not necessarily correlate with cardiac ischemia.

The patient was intubated for airway protection but is now extubated and breathing comfortably with good oxygen saturation levels. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, likely due to the GIB, and there are no signs of infection or infiltrate on the chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ongoing bleeding from the duodenal ulcer, leading to continued drop in Hct.
2."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with syncope and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient underwent an endoscopy and was found to have a duodenal ulcer with a visible vessel, which was clipped twice and received an epinephrine injection. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been dropping despite transfusions, currently at 23.5.

The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. The troponin T levels are elevated at 0.26 and trending down. The patient's cardiologist has advised that Plavix can be discontinued, and ASA is not being restarted.

The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Vital signs show a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 to 97/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented, with symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds. Bowel sounds are present, and extremities are absent pulses in both the right and left sides.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who was transferred from another hospital with syncope and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He has a history of duodenal ulcer (DU) and likely NSAID use. The patient underwent an endoscopy, which showed a bleeding vessel in the duodenum. An epinephrine injection and clips were applied to stop the bleeding. However, the patient continued to bleed, requiring a transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His hematocrit (HCT) is currently stable at 30%. The patient's blood loss has been managed, and he is being maintained on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 72 hours before being sent home on oral medication. 

The patient was intubated for airway protection due to GIB, but he is now extubated and breathing comfortably with good oxygen saturation. The circumstances of his syncope are likely related to GIB with a vasovagal episode. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and underwent stenting with a drug-eluting stent. He was advised to remain on anticoagulation therapy, but it was held after the endoscopy due to GIB. The patient's troponin levels have increased, indicating a possible cardiac event. However, there are no signs of ischemia on the electrocardiogram (EKG), and the healthcare team has low suspicion of a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and duodenal ulcer (DU).
- He presented with syncope and GIB, and a bleeding vessel was found during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
- The patient received epinephrine injection and two clips were placed to control the bleeding. However, he continued to bleed and required three units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) initially dropped to 23.5 but has now stabilized at 30.
- The patient is maintaining on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for 72 hours and will be sent home on oral medication.
- He remains NPO (nothing by mouth) and will be advanced to clear liquids as tolerated.
- The patient's pulmonary status was initially critical but has improved, and he was successfully extubated overnight with good oxygen saturation.
- The circumstances of his syncope are likely related to GIB and a vasovagal episode.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and underwent stenting of a coronary artery with a drug-eluting stent.
- Due to the recent gastrointestinal bleeding, the patient was advised to hold aspirin and Plavix, which were restarted after consulting with his outpatient cardiologist.
- Troponin levels peaked at 0.26, and there are no current signs of ischemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU with a history of syncope and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He underwent endoscopy and was found to have an active upper GI bleed due to a duodenal ulcer. The bleeding was controlled using clips and an epinephrine injection. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is now stable. He continues to receive an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip for 72 hours and will follow up with the referring hospital for further management of the GI bleed. There is no indication for transfusion at this time.

The patient also has respiratory failure, but no further respiratory issues have been reported. There is a question of syncope, but no evidence of acute coronary syndrome, seizure, or stroke. It is likely a vagal event related to the GI bleed. The patient's hypertension should be managed with antihypertensives, and his leukocytosis has improved, possibly due to the stress of the GI bleed. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and will need to restart aspirin upon discharge. His outside cardiologist has approved the discontinuation of Plavix.

The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 to 126/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. He is well-nourished and shows signs of muscle wasting. His neurological examination reveals that he is attentive, oriented to time, place, and person, but movement, tone, and other neurological functions have not been assessed.

Laboratory results indicate a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 12.1 K/uL, platelet count of 140 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.10 ng/mL, blood glucose level of 106 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Re-bleeding of the duodenal ulcer.
2. Development of respiratory infections due to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypotension and shock if there is significant blood loss or fluid imbalance.
4. Kidney injury due to hypoperfusion or sepsis.
5. Cardiac events such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
6. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
7. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest and immobility.
8. Nosocomial pneumonia.
9. Delirium or worsening cognitive function due to prolonged ICU stay and sedation.
10. Infection at the site of endoscopic procedures."

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU with a history of syncope and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He underwent endoscopic treatment for an active upper GI bleed caused by a duodenal ulcer, and clips were applied. The patient received epinephrine injection as well. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is now stable. The plan is to continue an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip for a total of 72 hours. No indication for transfusion is present at this time.

The patient has respiratory failure but no further respiratory issues are reported. There is a question regarding the syncope, but no evidence of acute coronary syndrome, seizure, or stroke is found. A probable vagal event in the setting of GI bleed is suggested. A CT head is unremarkable, with no evidence of bleed.

The patient has hypertension, which will have resumed antihypertensive medications. Leukocytosis has improved, likely due to the stress of the GI bleed. The patient has coronary artery disease (CAD) and will need to restart aspirin (ASA) upon discharge. The patient's outside cardiologist agrees not to give Plavix.

ICU care includes advancing nutrition to clear liquids, maintaining glycemic control, and providing prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and"
