   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Given purulent
   secretions, fever a likely component is superimposed tracheobronchitis,
   possible PNA.  Will add cefipime to antibiotics.  Follow vanco level,
   redose as indicated.  MDIs inline with ventilator given history of
   asthma, doesn't seem tight on exam now.  No steroids.  Volume status
   will also be important, minimize fluids if possible.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA):  Probable PNA as
   above.  Line infection seems less likely given multiple negative
   cultures including prior to starting antibiotics.  Repeat clutures and
   line tip culture pending.  Will follow up on these.
 HYPOTENSION:  Possible sepsis on levophed, may be component of
   intravascular depletion albeit hesitant to be aggressive with fluids.
   Try to wean.  If unable to wean will try gentle fluid challenge.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  SDH as below.  Now sedated on
   propofol, also active infection will exacerbate.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC SDH:  Stable neurological exam.  Repeat scan [**8-17**]
   showed no change.
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD):  Last
   dialyzed yesterday.  Truncated for unclear reasons albeit they were
   apparently having trouble with flow through left subclavian dialysis
   catheter so this was also taken out.  Tip sent for culture.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  Sugars adequately controlled on
   RISS in setting of infection.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS:  Stable on dilantin.  Check
   levels.
 ASSYMETRIC UPPER EXTREMITY EDEMA:  Greater on side of PICC line.
   Ultrasound to evaluate for thrombosis.  [**Month (only) 11**] be another etiology of
   fever albeit higher than would be expected unlesss infected.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, and previous stroke. He presented with acute respiratory distress, hypotension, and fever. The patient had a fall resulting in an acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) and experienced seizures, for which he was loaded with dilantin.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. He developed respiratory failure, likely secondary to superimposed tracheobronchitis or pneumonia (PNA), for which cefipime was added to his antibiotic regimen. The patient also had an unknown origin fever, initially suspected to be a line infection but now believed to be PNA. Cultures have been repeated and the line tip culture is pending.

The patient's hypotension is attributed to possible sepsis and intravascular depletion. He is currently on levophed and being managed carefully with fluid challenges.

The patient's mental status is altered due to the SDH and active infection. He is sedated on propofol and his condition will likely worsen.

Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD), is present, and the patient's most recent dialysis session was truncated. The dialysis catheter was also removed and sent for culture.

Diabetes mellitus type II is well-controlled in the setting of infection.

The patient experienced a seizure,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted with left subdural hematoma causing seizure, on hemodialysis without residual urine output, and possible line infection on gentamicin and vancomycin. He is being transferred for respiratory distress, hypotension, and hypoxia. The patient is now intubated, oxygenating well, likely has pneumonia per chest X-ray and fevers.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted with left subdural hematoma causing seizure, on hemodialysis without residual urine output, and possible line infection on gentamicin and vancomycin. The patient is being transferred for respiratory distress, hypotension, and hypoxia. 

24-hour events include the placement of a temporary dialysis line, positive sputum cultures for GNR and G+ Cocci in pairs, and initiation of dialysis catheter with sideport. The patient has allergies to hydromorphone and metoclopramide, and has received antibiotics including cefepime and vancomycin. 

Vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and mild hypoxia. Fluid balance indicates a positive fluid intake of 1,028 mL and output of 450 mL. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. 

Physical examination reveals cardiovascular stability, clear lung sounds, soft and distended abdomen, trace edema, and decreased peripheral pulses. Neurologic examination is not assessable due to sedation and intubation. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lipase levels. Imaging and microbiology results are pending. 

Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, renal failure, hypertension, hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and seizure without status epilepticus. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory distress, volume overload, possible aspiration event, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, hypotension, line infection, high bilious output via NG tube, inflammatory process in the abdomen, inflammatory bowel disease, end-stage renal disease, atrial fibrillation, seizure activity, subdural hematoma, glaucoma, cataracts, asthma exacerbation, diabetes management, and access issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted initially for an acute on chronic subdural hematoma caused by a fall. The patient experienced respiratory distress, hypoxia, fever, and hypotension, leading to transfer to the MICU. The patient's hemodialysis (HD) line was removed due to concern for bacteremia, and subsequent sputum cultures showed growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC).

Over the past 24 hours, several events occurred. An axillary arterial line was placed, revealing pressures higher than measured by non-invasive methods. Continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) was started but stopped prematurely due to difficulties with the line. Clots were found in the temporary line. Neuro dosing of fosphenytoin was administered, and the neurology team consulted regarding the patient's prognosis but could not provide further details due to comorbid illnesses.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/42 to 135/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole, fosphenytoin, and other ICU medications. The patient's weight is 91.6 kg, with a"

The patient is a 73-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was initially admitted for an acute on chronic subdural hematoma caused by a fall. The patient suffered a seizure and was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress, hypoxia, fever, and hypotension. The patient's hemodialysis (HD) line was removed due to concern for bacteremia, and sputum cultures showed growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC).

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and cefepime, for suspected pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has been managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's mental status is altered, and no sedation is being used.

The patient has a high output of bilious nasogastric (NG) aspirate, suggesting a possible inflammatory process or obstruction. The patient's fluid balance is negative due to the NG output.

   73 yom HD-dependent, admitted with left acute on chronic SDH c/b
   seizure, transferred to MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory Distress: etiology includes volume overload given
   resuscitation with anuric renal failure and likely PNA supported by
   sputum GS significant for GNR and GPC.  Barriers to intubation include
   mental status, fluid overload and underlying infection.
   - respiratory failure: continue PSV with daily [**Last Name (LF) 1093**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] attempt to
   wean once HD re-initiated
   - volume overload: replaced temporary dialysis catheter with tunneled
   line vs. additional temporary catheter via IR, pressures have been
   stable and may be suitable for HD vs. CVVH today
   - pneumonia: continue vanomycin (day 8) and cefepime ([**2-23**]) for GP and
   GN coverage
 will adjust as cultures and sensitivies return
   - mental status: continue no sedation for further evaluation of mental
   status
   # Hypotension / Fevers: s/p axillary a-line  placement with adequate
   pressures off pressors since line placed.  This suggests that
   non-invassive pressures may have been inaccurate.  Patient has remained
   afebrile since [**8-21**].
   - continue vancomycin / cefepime for concern of pneumosepsis pending
   cultures and sensitivities
   # High Bilious Output: continued high output now 1500 cc per day in
   setting of BM suggesting now obstruction or ileus.  This may represent
   inflammatory process without outflow obstruction.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI with daily guiacs to evaluate for continued bleeding
   - consider replacing NGT as may have migrated to inappropriate position
   # ESRD: patient attempted CVVH yesterday but line problems prevented
   full session.  Patient remains clinically volume overloaded with
   negative fluid balance while in ICU do to elevated NG output.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 73-year-old patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic subdural hematoma
- Initially admitted after falling and experiencing a seizure
- Transferred to MICU for respiratory distress, hypoxia, fever, and hypotension
- Patient's hemodialysis (HD) line was pulled due to concern for bacteremia
- Sputum cultures show growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC)
- The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including volume overload, pneumonia, high bilious output, ESRD, atrial fibrillation, seizure, subdural hematoma, glaucoma/cataracts, diabetes mellitus, access problems, nutrition, prophylaxis, and code status

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may progress to respiratory failure if not adequately supported.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of GNR and GPC in sputum cultures suggests a bacterial infection, possibly leading to pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The combination of hypoxia, fever, and hypotension indicates a possible systemic infection, which could lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
4. Volume overload: The patient's fluid overload puts them at risk for congestive heart failure or exacerbation of underlying cardiac conditions.
5. High bilious output: The high output of bilious material may indicate an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH). He was admitted to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, hypertension, hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and seizure. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA) indicated by sputum gram stain significant for gram-negative rods (GNR) and gram-positive cocci (GPC). Intubation was challenging due to mental status changes, fluid overload, and underlying infection. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will continue with daily weaning attempts once hemodialysis (HD) is re-initiated.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which was addressed by replacing the temporary dialysis catheter with another temporary catheter via interventional radiology (IR). Pressures have been stable, and the patient underwent HD yesterday.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin (day 9) and cefepime (9) for GP and GN coverage. Antibiotic therapy will be adjusted based on culture and sensitivity results.
4. Mental Status: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo male with h/o Chronic Renal Failure and now has SDH complicated
   by seizure, altered mental status and now with fevers and concern for
   sepsis and now with patient showing persistent and concerning
   alteration in mental status even with sedation discontinued.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with persistent volume overload and
   concern for pneumonia at this time.  In the setting of persistent
   alteration of mental status will need to continue invasive support.
   -Continue with broad antibiotic support
   -Suction as needed
   -Wean in PSV mode going forward
   2)Altered Mental Status-In setting of Sub-Dural Hematoma, seizure and
   signficant toxic/metabolic insult but with very slow to improve
   responsiveness with sedation discontinued
   -Dliantin
   -Hold sedation
   -Follow exam
   -EEG and repeat head imaging if not able to see trend to improved
   alertness
   3)Pneumonia-
   -Cefepime/Vanco to continue
   -High stool output to be followed
we see suggestion of ileus and
   continued drainge leading to decompression
   4)Renal Failure-
   _Continue with HD
   -Will continue to maintain negative fluid balance.

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure who presented with a subdural hematoma (SDH) complicated by seizure, altered mental status, and fevers. The patient is currently showing persistent and concerning alteration in mental status even with sedation discontinued. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 89/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient has atrial fibrillation as his heart rhythm.

Physical examination reveals that the patient has normocephalic head, diminished breath sounds on respiratory/chest examination, trace edema in both lower extremities, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurological examination shows the patient responds to noxious stimuli, minimal grimace, and withdrawal of lower extremities to simulation.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, elevated blood glucose levels, and various electrolyte abnormalities. Imaging studies show no new findings on chest X-ray, and blood cultures are negative.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure with persistent volume overload and concern for pneumonia, altered mental status in the setting of subdural hematoma, seizure, and significant toxic/metabolic insult, pneumonia, renal failure, and potential ileus.

The plan includes continuing broad antibiotic"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) with seizures. The patient has been on hemodialysis (HD) due to ESRD and was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin (FUO), altered mental status, hypertension, hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and a seizure episode. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to volume overload, underlying infection, and pneumonia (PNA) supported by sputum gram stain showing significant gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci.

The patient's hypotension and fever indicate a potential infection, and the patient has completed a course of vancomycin. The patient's hypotension is also related to septic shock, and he has been restarted on levophed.

The patient has a high bilious output without evidence of obstruction or ileus. This may represent an inflammatory process or another cause unrelated to gallbladder or pancreas involvement.

The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires ongoing hemodialysis (HD) management.

The patient's right upper extremity swelling is due to a non-occlusive clot.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for acute respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient had left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) causing a seizure, and he was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis.

The patient's current condition includes fever with unknown origin, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypertension, hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and seizure. He is on mechanical ventilation in the prone position with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). His vital signs are as follows: temperature of 102.3°F, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 103/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated creatinine, low albumin, elevated potassium, and elevated glucose levels. Imaging shows increased hilar density on chest X-ray without effusions.

Plan:

1. Respiratory Distress: Continue pressure support ventilation (PSV) with daily weaning attempts once hemodialysis (HD) is re-initiated.
2. Volume Overload: Continue HD.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient with initial history notable for sub-dural hematoma complicated
   by seizures subsequently who now has persistent renal failure and
   recurrent fever in the setting of sepsis.  Of concern is that patient
   has had evidence of significant fever in the setting of a mild rise in
   WBC count.  This is without localizing laboratory findings.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Levophed
   -Vanco/Cefepime
   -Will resend cultures from blood, sputum and urine
   -Will continue Vanco at this time
   -Follow cultures
   -Will go to broad spectrum antibiotics in the setting of increased
   pressor requirements
   -Will have to expand to coverage to focus on VAP with Vanco/Meropenem
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Atrovent/Albuterol
   -Continue with PSV support
   -Maintain O2
   3)Renal Failure-
   -Will move to CVVH in the setting of hypotension if unable to tolerate
   HD over next 24 hours
   4)Sub-Dural Hematoma/Altered Mental Status-He has persistent deficit as
   described above
   -Will repeat head CT to evaluate stability of bleed or new obvious

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a sub-dural hematoma, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been febrile since admission. The patient has a history of seizures and is on antiepileptic medication. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, with a fever of 102.3 F. He has right lower extremity edema and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologically, he is unresponsive but moves his lower extremities to stimulation. Lab results indicate elevated WBC count, elevated creatinine, and decreased albumin levels. Blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recurrent fever and mild rise in WBC count suggest a possible infection, which could progress to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing VAP. This would require broad-spectrum antibiotics and possibly changing ventilator settings.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate ongoing renal dysfunction. This may require further dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
4. Neurological deficits: The patient's persistent altered mental status and lack of reliable withdrawal response indicate potential ongoing neurological damage. Repeat head CT scans will be necessary to assess the stability of the sub-dural hemat"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male who is HD-dependent and admitted with left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) causing seizure. The patient was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure not associated with ARDS. The etiology includes volume overload due to anuric renal failure and likely pneumonia supported by sputum gram stain significant for GNR and GPC. Barriers to intubation include mental status, fluid overload, and underlying infection.

2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient spiked temperatures overnight and was pan-cultured. The patient has known MRSA pneumonia and completed a course of vancomycin today. Hypotension was also noted, and the patient was restarted on levophed. Vancomycin and cefepime will continue for concern of pneumosepsis pending cultures and sensitivities.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, but it is not delirium. Correction of electrolyte disturbances and treatment of infection are ongoing.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is dependent on hemodialysis (HD). HD or continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) will be initiated tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, and sepsis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 139/56 mmHg (93/38 mmHg), respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient also has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and seizure disorder.

The patient's imaging studies reveal right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, which is consistent with pulmonary edema. The microbiology report indicates the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, and hypertension. The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, gentamicin, and meropenem. The patient is also receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to renal failure.

The patient's current plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and antibiotic therapy. The patient's mental status is being evaluated, and electrolyte disturbances are being corrected. The patient's fever and hypotension are being closely monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and worsening renal function. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent these complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of subdural hematoma, persistent renal failure, and recurrent fever in the setting of sepsis. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

1) Sepsis: The patient is being treated with vancomycin and gentamicin antibiotics. His fever curve should be monitored.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will initiate continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to improve fluid status and mental status, bringing us closer to extubation.
3) Renal Failure: CVVH will be initiated today for renal failure management.
4) Sub-Dural Hematoma/Altered Mental Status: Sedation will be held to assess any changes in mental status.
5) Seizure Disorder: The patient is on Neurontin and Dilantin for seizure management.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 105/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactic acid, and liver enzymes. His glucose level is also elevated.

   1. No significant change in evolving subdural hematoma overlying the
   left
   cerebral convexity, with minimal mass effect, unchanged from prior
   exams.
   2. No new hemorrhage or mass effect.
   Microbiology: MRSA PNA [**8-22**] (from sputum culture)
   blood cxs, urine cxs negative or pending
   Assessment and Plan
   73 yom HD-dependent, admitted with left acute on chronic SDH c/b
   seizure, transferred to MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory Distress: etiology includes volume overload given
   resuscitation with anuric renal failure and likely PNA supported by
   sputum GS significant for GNR and GPC.  Barriers to intubation include
   mental status, fluid overload and underlying infection.
   - respiratory failure: continue PSV with daily [**Last Name (LF) 1093**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] attempt to
   wean once HD re-initiated
   - volume overload: continue HD
   - pneumonia, completed 10 day course
   - continue vanomycin (day 10)
   - treating for  VAP (fever in setting of hypotension) - Gentamycin day
   2, Meropenem day 2, Vancomycin Day 12 for GP and GN coverage
 will
   adjust as cultures and sensitivies return : recheck sputum cultures as
   had too many epi cells
   - checking gent level today if < 2 continue gent
   - mental status: continue no sedation for further evaluation of mental
   status, correct electrolyte disturbances, treat infection
   # Hypotension / Fevers: Fevers largely resolved.  Pt was pan cultured.
   Pt has known MRSA pneumonia.  Hypotension as also noted and pt was
   restarted on levophed yesterday and has required levophed off and on.
   - continue vancomycin / meropenem
   - f/u cultures
   - CXR
   - continue levophed for hypotension, avoid aggressive volume
   - CT head
   # Sinus tachy with aberrancy
 continue strict monitoring of
   electrolytes.  Called renal to discuss HD or CVVH.  Recommended
   starting it tomorrow.  Continue monitoring on tele.
   # High Bilious Output:  Resolved.  Is able to tolerate TF with clear
   residuals.  He is having BM and Xray confirmed no obstruction or ileus.
   - improved significantly,
   - continued TF
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   # ESRD:
   - touch base with renal regarding when dialysis can restart, still
   requiring pressors off and on
   -check BPs manually on left arm to correlate to A-line since A-line
   pressures could be affected by clot on right side (?)
   # AF: patient in NSR.  Continue to hold anti-coagulation for underlying
   SDH
   # Right Upper Extremity Swelling: u/s shows non occlusive clot
   -  will not pull out PICC as non-occlusive
   # Seizure: no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity
   - c/w neuro regarding fosphenytoin dosing considering possible HD

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, admitted for acute on chronic subdural hematoma and seizure. He was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, volume overload, pneumonia, hypotension, fever, sinus tachycardia with aberrancy, high bilious output, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), atrial fibrillation (AF), right upper extremity swelling, seizure, subdural hematoma (SDH), glaucoma/cataracts, diabetes mellitus (DM), and poor peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to underlying infection and fluid overload.
2. Volume overload leading to pulmonary edema.
3. Pneumonia caused by Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
5. Hypotension requiring vasopressor support.
6. Fever in the setting of hypotension, indicating possible infection.
7. Mental status changes due to electrolyte imbalances, infection, or SDH.
8. ESRD requiring dialysis.
9. AF with no anticoagulation due to SDH.
10. Non-occlusive clot in the right upper extremity.

   seizure, transferred to MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and
   hypotension.
   # Hypotension / Fevers/White count: New fever overnight.  Pt was pan
   cultured.  Hypotension as also noted and pt was restarted on levophed
   yesterday and has required levophed off and on.  Were concerned for VAP
   given sputum GS with GPR.  However no growth.
   - on vancomycin / meropenem
   - All Bcx negative/NGTD, sputum + for residual GPCs
   - CXR
   - continue levophed for hypotension, avoid aggressive volume
   - is there an infection somewhere else?  - line infection, sinusitis,
   intrabdominal process --> liver enzymes, amylase/lipase
   # Respiratory Distress: volume overload (resuscitation with anuric
   renal failure); PNA supported by sputum GS significant for GNR and
   GPC;  Barriers to intubation include mental status, fluid overload and
   underlying infection.
   - respiratory failure: continue PSV with daily [**Last Name (LF) 1093**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] attempt to
   wean once HD re-initiated
   - volume overload: continue HD
   - pneumonia, completed 10 day course for MRSA pneumonia
   - treating for  VAP (fever in setting of hypotension) - Meropenem day
   3,  - Vancomycin Day 3 (after completion of 10 day course) for GP and
   GN coverage .  Gram stain + GPC in pairs and clusters.
   # Mental status: - CT head showed no worsening of SDH; no sedation for
   further evaluation of mental status, correct electrolyte disturbances,
   treat infection
   # High Bilious Output:  Resolved.  Is able to tolerate TF with clear
   residuals.  Did have h/o Guaic posive output.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   # ESRD:
   - CVVH filter clotted
   - trial of HD today
   - check BPs manually on left arm to correlate to A-line since A-line
   pressures could be affected by clot on right side (?)
   # AF: patient in NSR.  Continue to hold anti-coagulation for underlying
   SDH
   # Right Upper Extremity Swelling: u/s shows non occlusive clot
   -  will not pull out PICC as non-occlusive
   # Seizure: no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity
   - c/w neuro regarding fosphenytoin dosing considering possible HD
   # SDH: continue to hold anticoagulation, will follow neurology recs
   # Glaucoma /  Cataracts: continue home eye drops

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted for a seizure caused by a left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH).
- He has been in the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and a seizure.
- He was started on vancomycin and meropenem due to suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) but no growth was found.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including hypotension, fever, white count, volume overload, underlying infection, respiratory distress, pneumonia, and mental status changes.
- His nutrition has been a concern, but he is now tolerating tube feeds (TF) with clear residuals.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, and CVVH filter clotted.
- He is currently on CVVH, and a trial of hemodialysis (HD) was attempted today.
- The patient has a history of glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes mellitus type II, and seizure.
- His current medications include norepinephrine, insulin, pantoprazole, and various ICU medications.
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 93"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), admitted to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has several medical complications and ongoing issues:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had a persistent fever overnight, which is concerning for an underlying infection. The patient has been pan cultured and is currently on antibiotics for MRSA and GNR coverage.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring the use of levophed to maintain adequate blood pressure. This may indicate septic shock or another cause of distributive shock.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ESRD and is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). However, the CVVH filter has clotted, and there are plans for a trial of intermittent hemodialysis (HD) today.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) due to acute respiratory failure. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the sputum gram stain showing GNR and GPC. The patient is being treated empirically for both MRSA and GNR.

5. Mental Status Changes: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to infection, electrolyte imbalances"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a chief complaint of renal failure, respiratory failure, and subdural hematoma. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, seizures, and end-stage renal disease. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support. He is also receiving insulin to maintain glycemic control. 

The patient has been experiencing recurrent fever, which is concerning for an ongoing infection. The patient's mental status has improved after receiving antibiotics, but he remains sedated due to encephalopathy. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels indicating renal dysfunction, and elevated blood glucose levels. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 125/57 mmHg to 151/59 mmHg, heart rate between 98-106 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, symmetrical chest expansion, and normal heart sounds. The neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive and follows simple commands but has not been fully assessed due to sedation. 

The patient has several potential medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus"

   seizure, transferred to MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and
   hypotension.
   # Hypotension / Fevers/White count: Continues with fevers, pan cultured
   [**8-28**].  Levophed restarted [**8-28**] yesterday and has required levophed
   off and on, now on.  Were concerned for VAP given sputum GS with GPR.
   However no growth.
   - on vancomycin / meropenem, Meropenem is empiric for GNR
   - All Bcx negative/NGTD, sputum + for residual GPCs
   - CXR
   - continue levophed for hypotension, avoid aggressive volume
   - is there an infection somewhere else?  - line infection, sinusitis,
   intrabdominal process --> liver enzymes, amylase/lipase?
   # Respiratory Distress: volume overload (resuscitation with anuric
   renal failure); PNA supported by sputum GS significant for GNR and
   GPC;  Barriers to extubation include mental status, fluid overload and
   underlying infection.
   - respiratory failure: continue PSV with daily [**Last Name (LF) 1093**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] attempt to
   wean once HD re-initiated
   - volume overload: continue HD
   - pneumonia, completed 10 day course for MRSA pneumonia
   - treating for  VAP (fever in setting of hypotension) - Meropenem day
   4,  - Vancomycin Day 4 (after completion of 10 day course) for GP and
   GN coverage .  Gram stain + GPC in pairs and clusters, cultures
   pending.
   # Mental status: - CT head showed no worsening of SDH; no sedation for
   further evaluation of mental status, correct electrolyte disturbances,
   treat infection
   # Right Upper Extremity Swelling: u/s shows non occlusive clot
   -  will not pull out PICC as non-occlusive

","The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted with left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) causing seizures. He has been in the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient continues to have fevers, pan cultured on 8/28. Levophed was restarted yesterday and has required levophed off and on, now on. The concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was considered due to sputum gram stain with gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. However, no growth was observed. The patient is on vancomycin and meropenem, with meropenem being empiric for gram-negative rods.

The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to volume overload, as indicated by the resuscitation with anuric renal failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (GNR) and gram-positive cocci (GPC) were found in the sputum gram stain. Barriers to extubation include mental status, fluid overload, and underlying infection. 

The patient's mental status is being evaluated further, and electrolyte disturbances are being corrected. Infection treatment is ongoing. The patient has a non-occlusive clot in the mid axillary vein, but the PICC line will not be pulled out. 

The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires ongoing hemodialysis (HD) treatment. The patient is in normal sinus rhythm (NSR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted with left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) causing seizures. He has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is dependent on hemodialysis (HD). The patient was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. He has been experiencing fevers, pan cultured on 8-28, and required levophed off and on for hypotension. He is currently on vancomycin and meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to have hypotension despite being on levophed. This may indicate ongoing sepsis or another underlying cause such as heart failure or significant blood loss.

2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which could be due to an ongoing infection. The source of infection is still pending, but there is a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the sputum gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

3. Respiratory Distress: The patient has respiratory failure and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). Barriers to extubation include mental status, fluid overload, and underlying infection. The patient needs to be weaned off the ventilator once HD is re-initiated.

4. Volume Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which is contributing to the respiratory distress"

","The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of subdural hematoma, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He is currently experiencing fever, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and seizure disorder. The patient's medical team has identified several potential complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. He is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem, but his temperature is still spiking. A right upper quadrant ultrasound will be performed, and the PICC line will be removed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will aim for one more hemodialysis session before attempting extubation.

3. Renal Failure: The patient requires further hemodialysis due to renal failure.

4. Sub-Dural Hematoma/Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving, but he still has a subdural hematoma. 

5. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder and is currently being treated with phenytoin and dilantin.

6. PICC Line Clot: The preliminary read of the right upper extremity ultrasound shows that the PICC line is stable, and it will be planned to pull the PICC line.

The patient's other issues are being managed by the ICU team, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines ("

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has several medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, seizure disorder, and hypertension.

From the assessment and plan, it appears that the patient is experiencing multiple complications:

1. Nutrition alteration: The patient is unable to eat orally due to being intubated and has been on tube feeding (TF). There is a high bilious output, but it has since resolved, and the patient is now tolerating TF with clear residuals.

2. Fever, unknown origin (FUO): The patient continues to have fevers despite being on antibiotics. Cultures have been done, but no growth has been observed.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, but there is no evidence of delirium. The CT head shows no worsening of subdural hematoma (SDH).

4. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to volume overload caused by anuria and renal failure. Pneumonia is suspected, and the patient has been treated with antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient is being treated accordingly.

5. Right upper extremity swelling: The patient has swelling in the right upper extremity, and an ultrasound shows a"

The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient continues to have fevers despite being on antibiotics.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which is not delirium. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

3. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. He requires mechanical ventilation support.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of hypoglycemia.

5. Right Upper Extremity Swelling: The patient has swelling in the right upper extremity, and an ultrasound shows a non-occlusive clot. The PICC line has been pulled due to fevers.

   73 yom HD-dependent, admitted with left acute on chronic SDH c/b
   seizure, transferred to MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and
   hypotension.
   # Hypotension / Fevers/White count: Continues with fevers, pan cultured
   [**8-30**].  Levophed on and off for labile BP.
   - on vancomycin / meropenem (day 6), Meropenem is empiric for GNR
   - All Bcx negative/NGTD, sputum + for minimal Staph aureus
   - CXR
   - continue levophed for hypotension, avoid aggressive volume
   - ? central etiology of fever/autonomic dysfunction  such as seizure
   # Respiratory Distress: volume overload (resuscitation with anuric
   renal failure); PNA supported by sputum positive for minimal Staph
   aureus.  CXR cleared, mental status improved.  Attempted trial of
   extubation.  Pt failed and is reintubated.    Per his lack of
   significant growth in sputum, appears more euvolemic on exam (despite
   3.5 L + LOS), and clarity of chest Xray, would not expect pt to have
   this degree of respiratory failure.  Pt may not be strong enough to
   ventilate on his own.
   - respiratory failure: pt likely will require trach, and long term
   ventilation
   - volume overload: continue HD
   - pneumonia, completed 10 day course for MRSA pneumonia
   - treating for  VAP (fever in setting of hypotension) - Meropenem day
   6,  - Vancomycin Day 6 (after completion of 10 day course) for GP and
   GN coverage .  Gram stain + GPC in pairs and clusters, cultures
   pending.
   # Mental status: - CT head showed no worsening of SDH; no sedation for
   further evaluation of mental status, correct electrolyte disturbances,
   treat infection
   - appears much improved today
   - Vit B12, folate, TSH all normal
   # Seizure: no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity
   - c/w neuro regarding fosphenytoin dosing considering possible HD
   - f/u EEG

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for concerns of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise:

1. Alteration in nutrition: The patient may experience malnutrition due to his inability to eat orally and the need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or enteral nutrition.
2. Fever, unknown origin (FUO): The patient continues to have fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection despite receiving appropriate antibiotics.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status fluctuates, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient requires long-term ventilation and may require a tracheostomy due to his inability to ventilate adequately on his own.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are low and need to be monitored and managed appropriately.
6. Diabetes mellitus, type II: The patient has a history of diabetes, and his insulin regimen needs to be adjusted based on his current condition.
7. Seizure, without status epilepticus: The patient had a seizure, and ongoing monitoring and management with antiepileptic drugs are necessary.
8. Right upper extremity swelling: The patient has swelling in his right upper extremity, which may be due to a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and acute on chronic subdural hematoma. He was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications including fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, seizure, pneumonia, scrotal and buttock lesions, right upper extremity swelling, end-stage renal disease, atrial fibrillation, high bilious output, subdural hematoma, renal cyst, glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes mellitus, and poor wound healing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may require a tracheostomy and long-term ventilation due to his inability to ventilate on his own.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a 10-day course of MRSA pneumonia treatment. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given his prolonged intubation.
3. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires ongoing hemodialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Seizure: The patient had a seizure episode, and there is a risk of recurrent seizures due to underlying neurologic conditions.
5. Skin ulcers: The patient has dependent skin ulcers on his sc"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of subdural hematoma, persistent renal failure, and recurrent fever in the setting of sepsis. He has been critically ill and requires ongoing medical interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is experiencing low-grade fevers and ongoing pressor requirements, indicating possible septic shock. There is also purulent discharge from his HD line, which could be a source of infection. The access for lines is an issue, with the VIP port being the only central access for pressors. Other potential line insertion sites are suboptimal.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed extubation yesterday and his mental status is slow to clear. This suggests the possibility of respiratory failure. Tracheostomy may be needed to secure the airway.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has persistent renal failure and is on hemodialysis.
4. Sub-Dural Hematoma/Altered Mental Status: The patient has a subdural hematoma and altered mental status. There is progressive improvement in his condition, but he may still require close monitoring and neurological assessment.
5. Seizure Disorder: The patient has had seizures, and antiepileptic medications (Neurontin and Dilantin) have been initiated.
6. PICC line clot: The patient had a PICC line clot, which has been removed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted with left acute on chronic subdural hematoma causing a seizure. He is dependent on hemodialysis and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and glaucoma/cataracts. The patient presented with hypotension, hypoxia, and fever, leading to concern for sepsis. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.

24-hour events include bolusing IV phenytoin 300mg and checking free dilantin in the morning, starting midodrine, and performing a magnetic resonance venography (MRV) that revealed narrowing of right subclavian and brachiocephalic veins, as well as narrowing of left subclavian and internal jugular veins. The patient also has an enlarged mediastinal lymph node, unchanged from prior imaging.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/48 mmHg (79/40 mmHg), respiratory rate of 77 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is currently receiving norepinephrine at 0.05 mcg/kg/min and has various infusions and medications running.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23400"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted with left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) causing seizure, and subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to concerns of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is dependent on hemodialysis (HD). He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), glaucoma, cataracts, and scrotal and buttock lesions that are likely dependent skin ulcers. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, hypotension, fever, white blood cell count elevation, and mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may require tracheostomy and long-term ventilation due to failed extubation attempts and ongoing respiratory distress.
2. Volume overload: The patient may continue with hemodialysis to manage fluid overload.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for MRSA pneumonia and may develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient's central line is infected, which requires appropriate treatment and consideration for line replacement.
5. Seizure: The patient had a seizure, and ongoing seizure activity should be monitored. Further evaluation of mental status and management of seizure risk should be considered.

2) Respiratory Failure - The patient's mental status has improved today, and it is planned to attempt extubation over the weekend if the mental status continues to improve. However, tracheostomy remains a possibility based on the goals of care.
3) Renal Failure - HD is planned for today.
4) Sub-Dural Hematoma/Altered Mental Status - The patient's mental status has improved today.
5) Seizure Disorder - The patient is on Neurontin and Dilantin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F)
- Heart rate: 86 bpm
- Blood pressure: 103/39 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted with a left acute on chronic subdural hematoma causing seizures. He has been in the MICU for concerns of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing fevers, likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and gross pus from his right hemodialysis line, which could be a potential source of infection. He has been started on vancomycin due to the positive culture for MRSA and requires continued pressure support with levophed. The patient attempted extubation two days ago but failed and was reintubated. There are plans to switch to pressure support today and consider tracheostomy placement for long-term ventilation. The patient also has scrotal and buttock lesions, most likely dependent skin ulcers, for which herpes DFA will be done and wound care will continue. The patient's seizure activity is being monitored, and phenytoin has been administered. The patient may undergo hemodialysis today. His anticoagulation is being held, and he will follow neurology recommendations for subdural hematoma. He has controlled diabetes and glaucoma/cataracts, and his nutritional intake is being closely monitored."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old man admitted with left acute on chronic subdural hematoma causing seizures. He was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient continues to have fevers, indicating possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with sputum positive for minimal Staphylococcus aureus. There is also gross pus from the right hemodialysis (HD) line, which could be a source of infection. The patient has been on vancomycin, which was pan-culture negative on day 8. 

The patient requires continued pressure support with levophed due to respiratory distress, likely secondary to pneumonia or pulmonary edema. A trial of extubation was attempted two days ago but failed, and the patient is now reintubated. There is consideration for tracheostomy placement for long-term ventilation. 

The patient has dependent skin ulcers on the scrotal and buttock area, which are most likely due to pressure from being bedridden. A herpes DFA test is planned to rule out herpes infection. 

The patient's EEG is negative for ongoing seizure activity, so there is no gross evidence of a seizure. Phenytoin has been administered, and the patient's dilantin level will be followed up in the morning. 

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and may undergo hemodialysis today. Anticoagulation is being held, and neurology recommendations will be followed. 

The patient has glaucoma and cataracts, for which he continues to use home eye drops. His diabetes is well-controlled with insulin. 

Regarding access, the patient has an axillary arterial line, a temporary line for HD (which is infected), and is attempting to wean off pressors to pull the HD line. 

Nutritionally, the patient is tolerating tube feeding (TF). 

The patient's prophylactic measures include pneumoboots, PPI, and bowel regimen. 

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU while intubated. The family has been updated on the patient's condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's continued fevers and positive sputum culture for MRSA suggest the possibility of VAP. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and maintain proper airway management.

2. Pressure ulcers: The presence of dependent skin ulcers on the scrotal and buttock area indicates the need for regular repositioning and wound care to prevent further development or worsening of these pressure ulcers.

3. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension, along with the current fevers and positive sputum culture, raises concerns for ongoing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who was admitted to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has several medical conditions, including altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and seizure disorder.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), blood pressure ranging from 139/53 to 171/64 mmHg, heart rate between 74 and 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 15-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and intubated, with a ventilator set in CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. Imaging shows low lung volumes without opacities, and microbiology tests reveal sputum positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

The patient's plan of care includes continuing midodrine and reducing levophed as tolerated, attempting to add florinef for further blood pressure support, keeping mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and continuing vancomycin given the recent positive culture for MRSA to complete a 10-day course"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with left acute on chronic subdural hematoma causing seizure. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and glaucoma/cataracts. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been febrile, with the source of infection possibly being a line infection, as surveillance cultures have been drawn. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he is scheduled for hemodialysis on Monday. He also has scrotal and buttock lesions, which are likely dependent skin ulcers, and an EEG has been performed to assess for ongoing seizure activity. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and his blood sugars are well-controlled on SSI and lantus 40 daily.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and potential line infection indicate a high risk for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to identify early signs of septic shock.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's inability to maintain secretions and failure of attempted trial of extubation suggest a high risk for continued respiratory distress. Monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and end-tidal CO2 is essential.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's history of ESRD and impaired renal function increase the risk of further deterioration in kidney"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of subdural hematoma, persistent renal failure, and recurrent fever in the setting of sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for several conditions.

1. Septic Shock: The patient continues to have low-grade fevers and requires low-dose pressor support. He is being treated with vancomycin for MRSA in his sputum and midodrine. Today, his right internal jugular (RIJ) line will be removed, and a femoral hemodialysis (HD) line will be placed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's mental status has plateaued, and he is doing well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 532 mL. A reintubation plan needs to be established with the family before proceeding with extubation, which is likely to occur tomorrow. The possibility of a tracheostomy if extubation fails also needs to be discussed with the family.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's next hemodialysis session will be scheduled per renal consultation.

4. Sub-Dural Hematoma/Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved from last week but has plateaued recently.

5. Seizure Disorder: The patient is being treated with neurontin and dilantin for his seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is critically ill and faces several potential medical complications. These include septic shock, respiratory failure, renal failure, subdural hematoma, and seizure disorder. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   Continues to have low grade fevers and low dose pressor requirment.
   Cont vanc for MRSA in sputum.  Cont midodrine.  Getting R IJ line
   pulled today and replaced with femoral HD line
   2)Respiratory Failure- Mental status has plateaued - pt dooing well on
   PSV 5/5.  Need to establish reintubation plan with family prior to
   proceeding with extubation - likely tomorrow given IR
   procedure/sedation today.  Need to establish if they would want to
   proceed with trach if he fails extubation.
   3)Renal Failure- next HD this afternoon per renal

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a complex medical history, including subdural hematoma, renal failure, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and a seizure disorder. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several conditions.

1. Septic shock: The patient has low-grade fevers and requires a low dose of norepinephrine, indicating ongoing septic shock. He is receiving vancomycin for suspected MRSA in his sputum and midodrine. The central venous line is being replaced from the right internal jugular vein to the femoral vein.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and his mental status has plateaued. There is a plan to establish a reintubation plan with the family before proceeding with extubation, likely tomorrow. The option of tracheostomy may be considered if extubation fails.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is scheduled for hemodialysis this afternoon.

4. Sub-Dural Hematoma/Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved from last week but has plateaued.

5. Seizure Disorder: The patient is on Neurontin and Dilantin for seizure management.

Other issues are being managed by the ICU team. The patient's nutritional status, glycemic control, and lines (including arterial and venous access) are also being addressed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted with a left acute on chronic subdural hematoma causing seizure. He has a history of renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and sepsis. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, hypoglycemia, and other medical complications. The patient has been on dialysis and has multiple lines and catheters inserted. His vital signs are stable, but he continues to have fevers, altered mental status, and difficulty maintaining secretions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and is on vancomycin. There is a concern for line infection as the most likely source of the infection. The patient remains on pressors despite the addition of midodrine and florinef.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is unable to maintain secretions, which led to the failure of attempted trial of extubation. He now requires direct tracheostomy placement. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and attempt at extubation will be done today.
3. Scrotal and Buttock Lesions: These are most likely dependent skin ulcers. The patient has tested negative for herpes simplex virus (DFA negative) and wound care will continue.
4. Seizure: Although there is no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity, the patient's EEG is negative. Neurology recommendations will be followed,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) causing seizure activity. He was transferred from the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is dependent on hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to have fevers, most likely originating from a line infection. He is on vancomycin and other antibiotics as per the medical team's assessment.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is unable to maintain secretions, leading to the failure of attempted trial of extubation. As a result, a decision has been made to place a direct tracheostomy (VS direct Trach) to secure the airway.
3. Scrotal and buttock lesions: These are most likely dependent skin ulcers. The patient has tested negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection using a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test. Wound care will continue for these lesions.
4. Seizure: The patient had a seizure episode, but there is no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is negative, indicating no seizure activity at the moment. However, the patient will remain on fosphenytoin, and free phen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, subdural hematoma, and renal failure. He has been experiencing ongoing fevers and intermittent pressor requirement, which indicates septic shock. The patient also has respiratory failure due to ongoing lack of improvement in mental status and ongoing secretions. He requires consultation for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Additionally, the patient has renal failure, for which he needs next hemodialysis session. The subdural hematoma and altered mental status are still present, although he is awake. The patient also has a seizure disorder, and medications like Neurontin and Dilantin have been initiated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's ongoing fevers and intermittent pressor requirement suggest ongoing infection and sepsis, which can lead to septic shock. Prompt treatment and control of the infection are crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's lack of improvement in mental status and ongoing secretions indicate ongoing respiratory failure. Tracheostomy and PEG may be necessary to improve his respiratory function.
3. Renal failure: The patient's persistent renal failure requires ongoing hemodialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Subdural hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma may require surgical intervention to relieve pressure on the brain.
5. Seizure disorder"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male who is hospital-dependent and admitted with a left acute on chronic subdural hematoma causing seizure. He has been transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension.

The patient also has respiratory distress due to the inability to maintain secretions, leading to failure of attempted trial of extubation. As a result, he will undergo tracheostomy placement today. He is NPO after midnight and will receive desmopressin (ddAVP) 30 minutes prior to the procedure due to low platelets. 

Furthermore, the patient has scrotal and buttock lesions, which are most likely dependent skin ulcers. A herpes DFA test was negative, and he will continue with wound care. 

Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure, but no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity was observed, and the EEG is negative. He will continue on fosphenytoin, with free phenytoin level checks every four days.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man who is hospitalized and dependent on hemodialysis (HD). He was admitted due to a left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) causing seizures. The patient has been transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for concern of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient continues to have fevers, with an unclear source but a possible infection in the bones (osteomyelitis) suggested by a CT scan. His ESR is low, which is not typical for this condition. The patient is on vancomycin, which is an antibiotic that covers possible line infections and certain bacteria that can cause osteomyelitis. The treatment plan includes continuing midodrine and florinef to maintain blood pressure, reducing levophed as tolerated, and keeping the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

There is also a respiratory distress issue due to the inability to maintain secretions, leading to a failed trial of extubation. As a result, the patient will undergo tracheostomy placement today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of subdural hematoma, encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and recurrent fever. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent renal failure and recurrent fever, which suggests the possibility of sepsis. The presence of fever spikes and ongoing infection raises concerns for septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. The tracheostomy was performed today, and there is a consideration for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube due to the patient's inability to eat.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of renal failure and is undergoing hemodialysis. There were issues with the femoral HD line, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) was administered. Alternative access options may be necessary if the current catheter is inoperative.
4. Sub-Dural Hematoma/Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has plateaued, and he is more sleepy today. Management for seizure disorder, including neurontin and dilantin, is ongoing.
5. Seizure Disorder: The patient had seizures initially, and antiepileptic medications are being administered to manage this condition.

Overall, the patient's critical illness requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications, including se"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with left acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH), causing seizures. He is dependent on hemodialysis (HD) and was transferred to the MICU due to concerns of sepsis with hypoxia and hypotension.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, which have not been attributed to osteomyelitis based on MRI results. He has been on vancomycin for suspected line infection, despite negative cultures. The patient requires pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. He also has respiratory distress, which improved after undergoing tracheostomy (trach). The patient continues to be agitated and tachypneic.

The patient has scrotal and buttock lesions that are likely dependent skin ulcers. A herpes DFA test was negative, and wound care is being continued. There is no evidence of ongoing seizure activity, and the EEG is negative. Phenytoin is being continued for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis with a femoral temporary line. Permanent access needs to be established. The patient's head injury is being managed by holding anticoagulation and following neurology recommendations.

    # Fevers: Continues with fevers, not osteomyelitis by MRI.  On
   vancomycin (day 7) for ?line infection although negative cultures.  On
   and off pressors despite addition of midodrine and florinef.   More
   likely due to abnormal autonomic dysfunction [**12-20**] to renal failure, but
   ddx includes infectious etiology given recent h/o sepsis.  With
   eosinophilia also consider drug reaction.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male who is hospitalized in the ICU for acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH), resulting in seizures. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is dependent on hemodialysis (HD). He was admitted with sepsis, hypoxia, and hypotension, and is currently being treated with vancomycin for a suspected line infection, despite negative cultures. The patient also has eosinophilia, which raises the possibility of a drug reaction.

The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to a tracheostomy performed yesterday, which initially had some oozing but improved. The patient remains agitated and tachypneic, requiring increased sedation and assist-control ventilation (AC). Tracheostomy site monitoring, weaning of ventilation support, continuation of HD for volume overload, and follow-up sputum cultures are recommended.

The scrotal and buttock lesions are most likely dependent skin ulcers, with a negative herpes DFA. Wound care is advised.

The patient's seizure activity is not evident on EEG, so fosphenytoin has been continued, with regular free phenytoin level checks. It is also suggested to reassess the anti-seizure regimen due to concerns about dilantin causing clotting in HD.

Regarding ESRD, the patient should continue with femoral temporary HD access and explore more permanent access"

   Assessment and Plan
   ESRD admitted with subdural hematomas after fall, now w/ poor mental
   status and persistent fevers.
   .
   # Fevers: Some improvement after d/c of fosphenytoin although one fever
   spike O/N to 101.  Has not required pressors for last 24 hrs although
   still on midodrine and florinef.  Have extensively searched for
   underlying source of fevers, including re-peated pancultures,  CT of
   chest, abdomen, pelvis.  The only findings have been  enlarged
   mediastinal lymph nodes: (1.5 x 2.1 cm prevascular lymph node and a
   precarinal lymph node measuring 2.2 x 0.7 cm).   Repeated sputum
   cultures show gram + cocci, however has already received long abx
   course for MRSA PNA and likely represents continued colonization.  Have
   D/c'd nonessential meds to eliminate possible sources of drug fever,
   including fosphenytoin yesterday.  Other tests not yet done for fever
   of unknown origin workup include: lower extremity US.
   -Can consider lower extremity US to search for DVT
   - Continue midodrine and florinef and reduce levophed as tolerated
   (hasn't required over last 24 hours): if no pressor requirement today,
   consider tapering off florinef and midodrine tomorrow
   - d/c all nonessential meds, vanc, dilantin
   - keep MAP > 65
   .
   #Mental Status change - Continues to be non-responsive to
   instructions.  Slight improvement in that he does make intermittent
   purposeful movements, including trying to remove trach.   Unclear
   underlying etiology: could be secondary to slow clearance of sedation
   or delirium of underlying infection versus effect of subdural
   hematomas.
   -Continue to hold sedation
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Trach placed.   Had some oozing but improved.
   Attempt switch to pressure support today.
   - monitor trach site
   - continue HD for volume overload
   .

","The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), subdural hematomas, poor mental status, and persistent fevers. The patient has undergone extensive testing, including cultures, CT scans, and lower extremity ultrasound, to identify the underlying cause of the fevers. The only finding has been enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes on CT scan, with repeated sputum cultures showing gram-positive cocci. However, this is believed to be colonization rather than an infection.

The patient's mental status has shown slight improvement, with intermittent purposeful movements, but remains non-responsive. The underlying etiology of the mental status change is unclear, with possible causes including sedation, infection, or the effect of subdural hematomas.

The patient's respiratory distress led to the placement of a tracheostomy tube. The tracheostomy site was initially oozing but improved, and pressure support is being attempted today. Close monitoring of the tracheostomy site is recommended.

The patient also has scrotal and buttock lesions, which are likely dependent skin ulcers. A herpes DFA test was negative, and wound care is being continued.

The patient experienced a seizure, but there is no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity, and the EEG is negative. The neurology team's recommendations include tapering off dilantin and uptitrating keppra.

The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) with"

   Assessment and Plan
   ESRD admitted with subdural hematomas after fall, now w/ poor mental
   status and persistent fevers.
   .
   # Fevers: Some improvement after d/c of fosphenytoin although one fever
   spike O/N to 101.  Has not required pressors for last 24 hrs although
   still on midodrine and florinef.  Have extensively searched for
   underlying source of fevers, including re-peated pancultures,  CT of
   chest, abdomen, pelvis.  The only findings have been  enlarged
   mediastinal lymph nodes: (1.5 x 2.1 cm prevascular lymph node and a
   precarinal lymph node measuring 2.2 x 0.7 cm).   Repeated sputum
   cultures show gram + cocci, however has already received long abx
   course for MRSA PNA and likely represents continued colonization.  Have
   D/c'd nonessential meds to eliminate possible sources of drug fever,
   including fosphenytoin yesterday.  Other tests not yet done for fever
   of unknown origin workup include: lower extremity US.
   -Can consider lower extremity US to search for DVT
   - Continue midodrine and florinef and reduce levophed as tolerated
   (hasn't required over last 24 hours): if no pressor requirement today,
   consider tapering off florinef and midodrine tomorrow
   - d/c all nonessential meds, vanc, dilantin
   - keep MAP > 65
   .
   #Mental Status change - Continues to be non-responsive to
   instructions.  Slight improvement in that he does make intermittent
   purposeful movements, including trying to remove trach.   Unclear
   underlying etiology: could be secondary to slow clearance of sedation
   or delirium of underlying infection versus effect of subdural
   hematomas.
   -Continue to hold sedation
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Trach placed.   Had some oozing but improved.
   Attempt switch to pressure support today.
   - monitor trach site
   - continue HD for volume overload
   .
   #Scrotal and buttock lesions
 most likely dependent skin ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and subdural hematomas. He was admitted with poor mental status and persistent fevers. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. His vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing fevers, which have improved after discontinuing fosphenytoin. An extensive search for an underlying source of the fevers has been conducted, including CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as repeated pancultures. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were found on the CT scans, but sputum cultures showed gram-positive cocci, which is likely colonization. Other tests, such as lower extremity ultrasound (US), are still pending for the fever of unknown origin workup.

The patient continues to be non-responsive to instructions with intermittent purposeful movements. The underlying etiology of the mental status change is unclear, potentially due to slow clearance of sedation, delirium secondary to infection, or the effect of subdural hematomas. Sedation will be continued, and neurology recommendations will be followed.

The patient's respiratory distress led to the placement of a tracheostomy, which improved his condition. Pressure support will be attempted today, and the tracheostomy site will be monitored. The patient has dependent skin ulcers on his scrotum and buttock"

   # Fevers: Given negative workup for FUO, considering drug fever as
   underlying source.  However, also has a leukocytosis today which he has
   intermittently had, in this case may be due to coritsol stim test.
   Some improvement after d/c of fosphenytoin although one fever spike O/N
   to 101.  Has not required pressors for last 48 hrs (one hrs duration
   last night)  although still on midodrine and florinef.  Have
   extensively searched for underlying source of fevers, including
   repeated pancultures,  CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis.  The only findings
   have been  enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes: (1.5 x 2.1 cm prevascular
   lymph node and a precarinal lymph node measuring 2.2 x 0.7 cm).
   Repeated sputum cultures show gram + cocci, however has already
   received long abx course for MRSA PNA and likely represents continued
   colonization.   Also has non-fermenter bacteria (not pseudomonas).
   Have D/c'd nonessential meds to eliminate possible sources of drug
   fever, including fosphenytoin yesterday.  Lower extremity US
   negative.
   - f/u diff for bandemia - if positive consider starting tx for non
   fermenter bacteria

   - Continue midodrine and florinef and reduce levophed as tolerated
   (brief requirement over last 24 hours): if no pressor requirement
   today, consider tapering off florinef and midodrine tomorrow
   - d/c all nonessential meds, vanc, dilantin
   - keep sbp> 90
   #Persistent hypotension - poor autonomic function given renal failure,
   vs sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test pending
   - higher threshold to start pressors, sbp> 90
   - no underlying infection has been discovered despite requirement of

   #Metabolic alkylosis - Worsening in the state of persistently elevated
   minute ventilation.   Overbreathing vent (set at MV of 8.8L/min).
   - avoiding sedation

   #Mental Status change - Continues to be non-responsive to

   underlying etiology: could be secondary to slow clearance of sedation
   or delirium of underlying infection versus effect of subdural
   hematomas.
   -Continue to hold sedation

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), admitted with subdural hematomas after a fall. He presents with altered mental status and persistent fevers. The patient has been unresponsive to commands but shows some purposeful movements. The etiology of his altered mental status is unclear, possibly due to slow clearance of drugs/metabolites or residual effects from the subdural hematomas. Sedating drugs will be continued to be held.

The patient has persistent hypotension, and the etiology is uncertain. It could be autonomic dysfunction related to renal failure, adrenal insufficiency, or sepsis. A [Last Name (un)] stim test has been performed and is pending.

The patient requires respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). An attempt will be made to switch to pressure control mode for improved comfort.

Seizure activity has been monitored, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) has shown no evidence of ongoing seizure activity. Medication management for seizures will follow neurology recommendations.

The patient's ESRD is being managed with ongoing hemodialysis (HD). Access for HD is a concern, and more permanent access needs to be established, with consultation from the renal team.

Anticoagulation is being held due to the presence of subdural hematomas, and neurology recommendations will guide further management.

","Summary:
The patient is an ESRD (End Stage Renal Disease) patient who was admitted with subdural hematomas after a fall. They have a history of poor mental status, persistent fevers, and various medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, seizure, impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, respiratory failure, hypoglycemia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has altered mental status and impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to multiple factors such as sedation, underlying infection, or the effect of subdural hematomas. Close monitoring of neurological status and avoiding excessive sedation is necessary.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient is on assisted ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. There is a potential for respiratory distress due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or complications related to tracheostomy.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers despite negative workup for an underlying source. This could be attributed to drug fever or colonization with non-fermenter bacteria. Further investigations are required to identify the cause.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has persistent elevated minute ventilation, leading to respiratory alkalosis. Proper management of ventilation parameters and avoiding overbreathing"

   ESRD admitted with subdural hematomas after fall, now w/ poor mental
   status and persistent fevers.
   # Fevers: Given negative workup for FUO, considering drug fever as
   underlying source.  However, also has a leukocytosis today which he has
   intermittently had, in this case may be due to coritsol stim test.
   Some improvement after d/c of fosphenytoin although one fever spike O/N
   to 101.  Has not required pressors for last 48 hrs (one hrs duration
   last night)  although still on midodrine and florinef.  Have
   extensively searched for underlying source of fevers, including
   repeated pancultures,  CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis.  The only findings
   have been  enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes: (1.5 x 2.1 cm prevascular
   lymph node and a precarinal lymph node measuring 2.2 x 0.7 cm).
   Repeated sputum cultures show gram + cocci, however has already
   received long abx course for MRSA PNA and likely represents continued
   colonization.   Also has non-fermenter bacteria (not pseudomonas).
   Have D/c'd nonessential meds to eliminate possible sources of drug
   fever, including fosphenytoin yesterday.  Lower extremity US
   negative.
   - f/u diff for bandemia - if positive consider starting tx for non
   fermenter bacteria
   - CXR
   - Continue midodrine and florinef and reduce levophed as tolerated
   (brief requirement over last 24 hours): if no pressor requirement
   today, consider tapering off florinef and midodrine tomorrow
   - d/c all nonessential meds, vanc, dilantin
   - keep sbp> 90
   #Persistent hypotension - poor autonomic function given renal failure,
   vs sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test pending
   - higher threshold to start pressors, sbp> 90
   - no underlying infection has been discovered despite requirement of
   pressors
   #Metabolic alkylosis - Worsening in the state of persistently elevated
   minute ventilation.   Overbreathing vent (set at MV of 8.8L/min).
   - avoiding sedation
   - switch to pressure control for improved comfort.
   # Respiratory Distress: On AC with trach.  Attempt switch to pressure
   support today.
   #Mental Status change - Continues to be non-responsive to
   instructions.  Slight improvement in that he does make intermittent
   purposeful movements, including trying to remove trach.   Unclear
   underlying etiology: could be secondary to slow clearance of sedation
   or delirium of underlying infection versus effect of subdural
   hematomas.
   -Continue to hold sedation
   #Scrotal and buttock lesions
 most likely dependent skin ulcers.
   Herpes DFA - negative
   - continue wound care
   # Seizure: no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity; EEG is
   negative
   - Neuro recs: to taper dilantin:  200 mg dilantin today, then 100 mg
   starting on [**9-11**] for 2 days, then can discontinue
   - uptitrating keppra to 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] X 2 days, then increase to 500 mg
   qAM and 250 qPM on [**9-12**]; will also get 500 mg boluses after each HD
   session
   # ESRD:
   - cont HD w/ femoral temp line today
   - need more permanent access: touch base w: renal
   # SDH: continue to hold anticoagulation, will follow neurology recs
   # Glaucoma /  Cataracts: continue home eye drops.
   -Consider inpt optho c/s if continued prolonged hospitalization.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, seizure disorder, and impaired skin integrity. He was admitted with subdural hematomas after a fall and now presents with poor mental status, persistent fevers, and hypotension. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, and dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has altered mental status and impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an increased minute ventilation and overbreathing, indicating possible respiratory failure. There is also a plan to switch from assist-control (AC) mode to pressure support mode for improved comfort.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's blood gases show a high CO2 level, suggesting metabolic alkalosis due to overbreathing.
4. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, possibly leading to sepsis.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation raises the suspicion of adrenal insufficiency, especially considering the renal failure.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires ongoing dialysis to manage his kidney failure.

   # Fevers: Given negative workup for FUO, considering drug fever as
   underlying source.  However, also has a leukocytosis today which he has
   intermittently had, in this case may be due to coritsol stim test.
   Some improvement after d/c of fosphenytoin although one fever spike O/N
   to 101.  Has not required pressors for last 48 hrs (one hrs duration
   last night)  although still on midodrine and florinef.  Have
   extensively searched for underlying source of fevers, including
   repeated pancultures,  CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis.  The only findings
   have been  enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes: (1.5 x 2.1 cm prevascular
   lymph node and a precarinal lymph node measuring 2.2 x 0.7 cm).
   Repeated sputum cultures show gram + cocci, however has already
   received long abx course for MRSA PNA and likely represents continued
   colonization.   Also has non-fermenter bacteria (not pseudomonas).
   Have D/c'd nonessential meds to eliminate possible sources of drug
   fever, including fosphenytoin yesterday.  Lower extremity US
   negative.
   - f/u diff for bandemia - if positive consider starting tx for non
   fermenter bacteria

   - monitor trach site
   #Mental Status change - Continues to be non-responsive to
   instructions.  Slight improvement in that he does make intermittent

   underlying etiology: could be secondary to slow clearance of sedation
   or delirium of underlying infection versus effect of subdural
   hematomas.
   -Continue to hold sedation

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, seizure disorder, and impaired skin integrity. He was admitted with subdural hematomas after a fall and now presents with poor mental status, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient has been on multiple medications including antibiotics, antiepileptics, and sedatives. He has undergone various tests and procedures such as ultrasound, cultures, and imaging studies. The patient's condition remains unstable, and several potential medical complications have been identified.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has non-healing lesions on his scrotum and buttocks, which are most likely dependent skin ulcers. Wound care is ongoing.
2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers despite extensive workup, including negative cultures. Possible causes include drug fever or colonization with non-fermenter bacteria.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is non-responsive to instructions with intermittent purposeful movements. The underlying etiology is unclear, but could be due to sedation, infection, or subdural hematomas.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient requires assisted ventilation with intermittent overbreathing. There is a need to switch to pressure support and monitor the tracheostomy site.
5. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD requiring hemodialysis (HD"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the ICU for subdural hematomas after a fall. The patient presents with poor mental status and persistent fevers. The patient has been evaluated for fever of unknown origin (FUO), and no underlying source has been identified. The patient has received a long course of antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia, but sputum cultures show gram-positive cocci, indicating colonization rather than infection. The patient continues to have persistent hypotension, which may be due to poor autonomic function, renal failure, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient's metabolic alkalosis is worsening, and respiratory distress persists. The patient's mental status change is non-responsive to instructions, but there has been slight improvement. The patient has dependent skin ulcers, likely due to pressure sores, and herpes DFA is negative. There is no evidence of ongoing seizure activity, and EEG is negative. The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis (HD) with a femoral temporary line, and more permanent access needs to be established. The patient has several other medical issues, including glaucoma/cataracts, diabetes mellitus (DM), access problems, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   # Fevers: Given negative workup for FUO, considering drug fever as
   underlying source.  No fever x24hrs.  Have D/c'd nonessential meds to
   eliminate possible sources of drug fever, including fosphenytoin.
   Leukocytosis trending down.  On midodrine and florinef, few hours on
   very low dose levo.  Have extensively searched for underlying source of
   fevers, including repeated pancultures, Lower extremity US negative,
   CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis.  Repeated sputum cultures show gram +
   cocci, however has already received long abx course for MRSA PNA and
   likely represents continued colonization.
   #Persistent hypotension - poor autonomic function given renal failure,
   vs sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test adequate.
   - Continue midodrine and florinef and reduce levophed as tolerated
   (brief requirement over last 24 hours): if no pressor requirement
   today, consider tapering off florinef and midodrine tomorrow
   - higher threshold to start pressors, sbp> 90

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with subdural hematomas following a fall. The patient is currently experiencing poor mental status and persistent fevers. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 128/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's current weight is 84.5 kg, and the admission weight was 94.2 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 5.3 to 7.6 mg/dL, and elevated glucose levels up to 272 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate abnormalities in potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and liver enzymes.

Imaging studies reveal the presence of subdural hematomas. The sputum gram stain shows gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci, but blood cultures are negative. The patient has received a long course of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and likely represents continued colonization.

The patient's assessment and plan include addressing persistent hypotension, respiratory distress, mental status changes, scrotal and buttock ulcers,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted after falling and experiencing subdural hematomas. He is currently in the ICU with poor mental status and persistent fevers. The patient has been on multiple medications, including fosphenytoin, which has been discontinued. His leukocytosis is trending down, but he still has persistent hypotension and requires pressors. He also has metabolic alkalosis and respiratory distress. The patient's mental status change is unclear, and he has scrotal and buttock lesions that are likely dependent skin ulcers. There are no signs of ongoing seizure activity, and his ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis (HD) with femoral temporary access. He also has a subdural hematoma (SDH) and needs to hold anticoagulation. Other issues include glaucoma/cataracts, diabetes mellitus (DM), and vascular access.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and hypotension may indicate an underlying infection leading to sepsis. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's poor autonomic function, hypotension, and requirement of multiple pressors suggest the possibility of adrenal insufficiency. Confirmatory tests such as a corticotropin stimulation test can be performed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the ICU with subdural hematomas after a fall. The patient presented with altered mental status and persistent fevers. The patient has been unresponsive but shows some purposeful movement, indicating improvement. The cause of the altered mental status is believed to be slow clearance of drugs/metabolites or residual effects from subdural hematomas. Sedating drugs are being held. The patient has persistent hypotension, possibly due to autonomic dysfunction related to renal failure, adrenal insufficiency, or sepsis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and has had a trial on pressure support ventilation (PSV) today. The patient had a seizure, but EEG results are negative for ongoing seizure activity. The patient's ESRD is being managed with regular hemodialysis. Access for hemodialysis is challenging, and a more permanent access is needed. Glycemic control is being monitored and adjusted as necessary. Anticoagulation is being held for the subdural hematomas, and neurology is following the case. The rest of the plan is detailed in the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and hypotension may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of subdural hematomas after a fall, and his current condition includes unresponsiveness, purposeful movements, negative EEG for ongoing seizure activity, hypotension, tracheostomy, and seizure management.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/54 mmHg to 162/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's weight has decreased from 94.2 kg at admission to 84.5 kg currently.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 293 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 103.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 26.7% to 30.0%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 376 K/uL, increased creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 5.3 mg/dL to 9.9 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 66 mg/dL to 272 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include fevers possibly due to drug fever or colonizer in the tracheostomy, altered mental status likely related to drug clearance or residual effect from subdural hematoma, persistent hypotension possibly caused by autonomic dysfunction, renal failure, adrenal insufficiency, or sepsis, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and ventilation support, seizure management with no evidence of ongoing seizure activity, end-stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis (HD), access challenges for HD, and glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and further infections due to the immunocompromised state. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   73yoM h/o ESRD admitted with subdural hematomas after fall, now w/ poor
   mental status and persistent fevers.
   1. Fevers: Given negative workup for FUO, considering drug fever as
   underlying source.  Low grade fever to 100.1 yesterday afternoon, pt
   was recultured with 2 BCx's and sputum Cx showing 2+ GPC's in pairs and
   2+ GNR's which do not appear to be new, and pt has received long course
   of ABx for MRSA PNA, so Cx's likely represent continued colonization.
   Workup to date has included removal of all nonessential meds to
   eliminate sources of drug fever, repeated panCx's, LE u/s which was
   negative and CT thorax which recommended MRI Lspine for evaluation of
   infectious etiology vs Schmorl's nods, and subsequent MRI Lspine which
   did not show infectious osteo or discitis. WBC count continues to trend
   down,and pt was not hypotensive through yesterday, pressors now being
   held. Pt currently off ABx.
   2. Persistent hypotension - poor autonomic function given renal
   failure, vs sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test adequate.
   - Midodrine held yesterday as sbp's ranging 125-181, now off pressors
   - No underlying infection has been discovered despite requirement of
   pressors
   3. Respiratory Distress: On PSV with trach, currently [**8-22**] with FiO2

   - Attempt to trach mask.
   4. Mental Status change: Per nursing was moving L arm to commands,
   however unable to follow commands this am. Does have spontaneous
   movement of 4 extrems. Unclear underlying etiology: could be secondary
   to slow clearance of sedation or delirium of underlying infection
   versus effect of subdural hematomas.

   Continue 500mg boluses after HD.
   7. ESRD:
   - Cont HD w/ femoral temp line, to get HD today
   - Will need to discuss placement of more permanent/tunneled line with
   renal, and whether low grade 100.1 temps will contraindicate.
   8. SDH: continue to hold anticoagulation, will follow neurology recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU for subdural hematomas following a fall. The patient presented with poor mental status and persistent fevers. The patient has been on a long course of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, but cultures show colonization with gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient's hypotension is still unresolved, and the underlying cause remains unclear. The patient requires respiratory support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen. The patient has mental status changes, seizures, scrotal and buttock ulcers, and an elevated creatinine level. The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) requires adjustment of insulin therapy. The patient has femoral central venous access and requires hemodialysis. The patient is being evaluated for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement and needs an upper gastrointestinal (GI) evaluation. The patient is also being considered for an inpatient ophthalmology consultation due to glaucoma and cataracts.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Drug fever: The patient has been on a long course of antibiotics, which may have caused a drug fever.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, hypotension, and requirement of vasopressors raise concerns for se"

   eliminate sources of drug fever, repeated panCx's, LE u/s which was
   negative and CT thorax which recommended MRI Lspine for evaluation of
   infectious etiology vs Schmorl's nods, and subsequent MRI Lspine which

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted for subdural hematomas caused by a fall. He has been unresponsive and experiencing persistent fevers. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 125-181 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's recent laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count of 16.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The culture results from blood and sputum samples revealed the presence of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Gram-negative rods (GNR), which may indicate continued colonization rather than a new infection.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fevers: The patient's low-grade fever is considered a potential drug fever due to ongoing antibiotic use. Cultures have been repeated, and no evidence of a new infection has been found.
2. Seizure: There is no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity, and the EEG is negative. The plan is to discontinue Dilantin and start Keppra.
3. Persistent hypotension: The patient's poor autonomic function could be related to renal failure, sepsis, or"

   Assessment and Plan
   73yoM h/o ESRD admitted with subdural hematomas after fall, now w/ poor
   mental status and persistent fevers.
   1. Fevers: Given negative workup for FUO, considering drug fever as
   underlying source.  Low grade fever to 100.1 yesterday afternoon, pt
   was recultured with 2 BCx's and sputum Cx showing 2+ GPC's in pairs and
   2+ GNR's which do not appear to be new, and pt has received long course
   of ABx for MRSA PNA, so Cx's likely represent continued colonization.
   Workup to date has included removal of all nonessential meds to
   eliminate sources of drug fever, repeated panCx's, LE u/s which was
   negative and CT thorax which recommended MRI Lspine for evaluation of
   infectious etiology vs Schmorl's nods, and subsequent MRI Lspine which
   did not show infectious osteo or discitis. WBC count continues to trend
   down,and pt was not hypotensive through yesterday, pressors now being
   held. Pt currently off ABx.
   2. Persistent hypotension - poor autonomic function given renal
   failure, vs sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test adequate.
   - Midodrine held yesterday as sbp's ranging 125-181, now off pressors
   - No underlying infection has been discovered despite requirement of
   pressors
   3. Respiratory Distress: On PSV with trach.  Attempt to trach mask.
   4. Mental Status change: Following some instructions and moving L arm
   to command.
   Continues to be non-responsive to instructions.  Slight improvement in
   that he does make intermittent purposeful movements, including trying
   to remove trach.   Unclear underlying etiology: could be secondary to
   slow clearance of sedation or delirium of underlying infection versus
   effect of subdural hematomas.
   -Continue to hold sedation
   #Scrotal and buttock ulcers
 most likely dependent skin ulcers.
   Herpes DFA - negative
   - continue wound care
   # Seizure: no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity; EEG is
   negative
   - Neuro recs Dilantin taper, started 100mg daily yesterday and will get
   100mg today, then stop tomorrow.
   - Uptitrating Keppra, today to receive 500mg in am and 250mg in pm.
   Continue 500mg boluses after HD.
   # ESRD:
   - cont HD w/ femoral temp line, to go to HD today
   - will need to discuss placement of more permanent/tunneled line with
   renal, and whether low grade 100.1 temps will contraindicate.
   # SDH: continue to hold anticoagulation, will follow neurology recs
   # Glaucoma /  Cataracts: continue home eye drops.
   -Consider inpt optho c/s if continued prolonged hospitalization.
   # DM: On SSI + lantus 40 daily; maintain BG < 250
    -  Blood sugars in 300
s yesterday, will need adjustment of SSI
   # Access: femoral line, currently temporary and will need placement of
   more permanent line.
   # FEN: tolerating TF, replate lytes prn
   - IR to evaluate today for placement of PEG tube
   # PPX: pneumoboots,  PPI; bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with subdural hematomas following a fall. He now presents with poor mental status, persistent fevers, and other medical complications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 100.1°F (37.8°C), blood pressure ranging from 139/53 to 181/78 mmHg, heart rate between 76-98 bpm, respiratory rate of 17-50 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and lactate. The differential count shows an increase in neutrophils and bands. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits. The patient's coagulation profile indicates prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, while the INR is within normal range. Imaging studies, including a CT thorax and MRI lumbar spine, did not reveal any signs of infection or other significant findings.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fevers: The patient has had persistent low-grade fever, which is likely due to drug colonization. Cultures have been repeated, and the patient has received a long"

   Assessment and Plan
   73yoM h/o ESRD anuric on HD, admitted for SDHs c/b seizures after a
   fall, now with unresponsive mental status and persistent fevers.
   1. Fevers: Given negative workup for FUO, considering drug fever as
   underlying source.  Low grade fever to 100.1 yesterday afternoon, pt
   was recultured with 2 BCx's and sputum Cx showing 2+ GPC's in pairs and
   2+ GNR's which do not appear to be new, and pt has received long course
   of ABx for MRSA PNA, so Cx's likely represent continued colonization.
   Workup to date has included removal of all nonessential meds to
   eliminate sources of drug fever, repeated panCx's, LE u/s which was
   negative and CT thorax which recommended MRI Lspine for evaluation of
   infectious etiology vs Schmorl's nods, and subsequent MRI Lspine which
   did not show infectious osteo or discitis. WBC count continues to trend
   down,and pt was not hypotensive through yesterday, pressors now being
   held. Pt currently off ABx.
   --Will not restart ABx
   --Check culture every other day
   --Head CT with sinus protocol to eval for sinus infection
   2. Seizure: no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity; EEG is
   negative
   --Neuro recs Dilantin taper
 will d/c today.
   --Uptitrating Keppra, today to receive 500mg in am and 250mg in pm.
   Continue 500mg boluses after HD.
   3. DM: On SSI + lantus 40 daily; maintain BG < 250
    -  Blood sugars in 300
s yesterday, will need adjustment of SSI
   4. Hypotension
Resolving, as not currently hypotense > 24hrs. Poor
   autonomic function given renal failure, vs sepsis vs adrenal
   insufficiency.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test adequate.
   --Midodrine held yesterday as sbp's ranging 125-181, now off pressors
   --No infections found to date to explain previous hypotension
   5. Respiratory Distress: On PSV with trach, currently [**8-22**] with FiO2
   50%
   --Attempt to trach mask.
   6. Mental Status change: Per nursing was moving L arm to commands,
   however unable to follow commands this am. Does have spontaneous
   movement of 4 extrems. Unclear underlying etiology: could be secondary
   to slow clearance of sedation or delirium of underlying infection
   versus effect of subdural hematomas.
   --Continue to hold sedation
   --Will get EEG today
   7. Scrotal and buttock ulcers
 most likely dependent skin ulcers.
   Herpes DFA - negative
   --continue wound care
   8. ESRD:
   - Cont HD w/ femoral temp line, to get HD today with Epo
   - Will need to discuss placement of more permanent/tunneled line with
   renal, and whether low grade 100.1 temps will contraindicate.
   - Access still L femoral line placed [**2191-9-4**].
   8. SDH
Hold anticoagulation.
   --Will get repeat EEG to see if having subclinical seizures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently admitted to the ICU for subdural hematomas (SDHs) following a fall. The patient has been unresponsive since admission and has persistent fevers despite negative workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO). Cultures show growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR), which are likely continued colonization due to long-term antibiotic use for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia.

The patient's seizure activity has been controlled, and EEG results are negative. The patient is being weaned off antiepileptic drugs, with plans to discontinue fosphenytoin. Blood glucose levels remain elevated, indicating the need for adjustment in diabetes management.

Hypotension is resolving, and the patient is no longer dependent on vasopressors. An adrenocortical insufficiency workup has been completed, and the patient's response to the [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stimulation test was adequate.

Respiratory distress persists, and the patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tracheostomy in place. Tracheostomy mask trials will continue.

Mental status changes are ongoing, with intermittent responsiveness. An electroencephalogram (EEG) will be obtained to assess for"

   Assessment and Plan
   73yoM h/o ESRD admitted with subdural hematomas after fall, now w/ poor
   mental status and persistent fevers.
   1. Fevers: Given negative workup for FUO, considering drug fever as
   underlying source.  Low grade fever to 100.1 yesterday afternoon, pt
   was recultured with 2 BCx's and sputum Cx showing 2+ GPC's in pairs and
   2+ GNR's which do not appear to be new, and pt has received long course
   of ABx for MRSA PNA, so Cx's likely represent continued colonization.
   Workup to date has included removal of all nonessential meds to
   eliminate sources of drug fever, repeated panCx's, LE u/s which was
   negative and CT thorax which recommended MRI Lspine for evaluation of
   infectious etiology vs Schmorl's nods, and subsequent MRI Lspine which
   did not show infectious osteo or discitis. WBC count continues to trend
   down,and pt was not hypotensive through yesterday, pressors now being
   held. Pt currently off ABx.
   2. Persistent hypotension - poor autonomic function given renal
   failure, vs sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test adequate.
   - Midodrine held yesterday as sbp's ranging 125-181, now off pressors
   - No underlying infection has been discovered despite requirement of
   pressors
   3. Respiratory Distress: On PSV with trach.  Attempt to trach mask.
   4. Mental Status change: Following some instructions and moving L arm
   to command.
   Continues to be non-responsive to instructions.  Slight improvement in
   that he does make intermittent purposeful movements, including trying
   to remove trach.   Unclear underlying etiology: could be secondary to
   slow clearance of sedation or delirium of underlying infection versus
   effect of subdural hematomas.
   -Continue to hold sedation
   #Scrotal and buttock ulcers
 most likely dependent skin ulcers.
   Herpes DFA - negative
   - continue wound care
   # Seizure: no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity; EEG is
   negative
   - Neuro recs: to taper dilantin: 100 mg starting on [**9-11**] for 2 days,
   then can discontinue
   - uptitrating keppra to 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] X 2 days, then increase to 500 mg
   qAM and 250 qPM on [**9-12**]; will also get 500 mg boluses after each HD
   session
   # ESRD:
   - cont HD w/ femoral temp line
   - tunneled HD line per renal recs now that his is afebrile
   - need more permanent access: touch base w: renal
   # SDH: continue to hold anticoagulation, will follow neurology recs
   # Glaucoma /  Cataracts: continue home eye drops.
   -Consider inpt optho c/s if continued prolonged hospitalization.
   # DM: On SSI + lantus 40 daily; maintain BG < 250

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with subdural hematomas after a fall. The patient has poor mental status and persistent fevers.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fevers: The patient has had persistent low-grade fever, which could be due to drug fever as the underlying source. The negative workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) suggests that drug fever is a possibility. Cultures have shown growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR), but these do not appear to be new, and the patient has already received a long course of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. Therefore, the fever is likely due to continued colonization rather than a new infection.

2. Persistent hypotension: The patient continues to experience persistent hypotension, which could be due to poor autonomic function secondary to renal failure, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. Despite the requirement of vasopressors, no underlying infection has been discovered. The patient's blood pressure ranges from 125-181 mmHg, and midodrine has been held.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient requires pressure support ventilation (PSV) through a tracheostomy tube. There have been attempts to extubate the patient using a mask"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with subdural hematomas after a fall. He has been experiencing poor mental status and persistent fevers. The patient has been receiving a long course of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, but his sputum cultures continue to show growth of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and Gram-negative rods, indicating colonization rather than a new infection. Other lab results include elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Fevers: The patient's persistent low-grade fever may indicate a drug fever due to the long course of antibiotics received for MRSA pneumonia. The negative workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) suggests that this is a possible cause.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be due to sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or renal failure. The stim test was adequate, ruling out adrenal insufficiency as the cause. Pressors have been held, but the patient remains hypotensive.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tracheostomy tube. The FiO2 has been increased to 50% to maintain oxygenation.
4. Mental status"

   Assessment and Plan
   73yoM h/o ESRD anuric on HD, admitted for SDHs c/b seizures after a
   fall, now with unresponsive mental status and persistent fevers.
   1. Fevers: Given negative workup for FUO, considering drug fever as
   underlying source.  Febrile to 102 this am , pt was recultured re-BCx
   and Myco/lytic Cx.  Head CT with opacification of mastoids, sinus
   mucosal thickening; ethmoidal, L maxillary, and sphenoidal sinuses with
   hyperdense material in L sphenoid sinus, could be inspissated mucus vs
   fungal infection in sphenoid sinus  --> NGT removedWith 2 BCx's and
   sputum Cx showing 2+ GPC's in pairs and 2+ GNR's which do not appear to
   be new, and pt has received long course of ABx for MRSA PNA, so Cx's
   likely represent continued colonization. Workup to date has included
   removal of all nonessential meds to eliminate sources of drug fever,
   repeated panCx's, LE u/s which was negative and CT thorax which
   recommended MRI Lspine for evaluation of infectious etiology vs
   Schmorl's nods, and subsequent MRI Lspine which did not show infectious
   osteo or discitis. WBC count continues to trend down,and pt was not
   hypotensive through yesterday, pressors now being held. Pt currently
   off ABx.
   - Nasopharyngeal culture?
   - Will not restart ABx
   - Check culture every other day
   2. Seizure: no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity; however
   mental status poor, EEG repeated and pending. Dilantin stopped.  Keppra
   500mg in am and 250mg in pm. Continue 500mg boluses after HD.
   3. DM: On SSI + lantus 40 daily; maintain BG < 250
    -  Blood sugars in 300
s yesterday, will need adjustment of SSI
   4. Hypotension
Resolving, no pressors> 24hrs. Fluoronef and Midodrine
   tapered. Poor autonomic function given renal failure vs sepsis. [**Last Name (un) 1398**]
   stim test adequate.
   - Continue to wean Fluoronef and Midodrine as tolerated
   5. Respiratory Distress: On PSV with trach, currently [**8-22**] with FiO2
   50%
   --Attempt to trach mask.
   6. Mental Status change: Per nursing was moving L arm to commands,
   however unable to follow commands this am. Does have spontaneous
   movement of 4 extrems. Unclear underlying etiology: could be secondary
   to slow clearance of sedation or delirium of underlying infection
   versus effect of subdural hematomas.
   --Continue to hold sedation
   7. Scrotal and buttock ulcers
 most likely dependent skin ulcers.
   Herpes DFA - negative
   --continue wound care
   8. ESRD:  HD yesterday with EPO
   - Cont HD w/ femoral temp line
   - Access still L femoral line placed [**2191-9-4**].
   8. SDH
Hold anticoagulation.
   --Will get repeat EEG to see if having subclinical seizures.
   9. Glaucoma /  Cataracts: continue home eye drops.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is anuric and on hemodialysis (HD). He was admitted for subdural hematomas (SDHs) secondary to seizures after a fall and is now unresponsive with persistent fevers. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 150/55 to 159/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals opacification of mastoids, sinus mucosal thickening, and hyperdense material in the left sphenoid sinus, which could be inspissated mucus or fungal infection. Microbiology results show 2+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and 2+ gram-negative rods.

   underlying source.  Febrile to 102 this am , pt was recultured re-BCx
   and Myco/lytic Cx.  Head CT with opacification of mastoids, sinus
   mucosal thickening; ethmoidal, L maxillary, and sphenoidal sinuses with
   hyperdense material in L sphenoid sinus, could be inspissated mucus vs
   fungal infection in sphenoid sinus  --> NGT removedWith 2 BCx's and
   sputum Cx showing 2+ GPC's in pairs and 2+ GNR's which do not appear to
   be new, and pt has received long course of ABx for MRSA PNA, so Cx's
   likely represent continued colonization. Workup to date has included
   removal of all nonessential meds to eliminate sources of drug fever,
   repeated panCx's, LE u/s which was negative and CT thorax which
   recommended MRI Lspine for evaluation of infectious etiology vs
   Schmorl's nods, and subsequent MRI Lspine which did not show infectious
   osteo or discitis. WBC count continues to trend down,and pt was not
   hypotensive through yesterday, pressors now being held. Pt currently
   off ABx.
   - Nasopharyngeal culture?
   - Will not restart ABx
   - Check culture every other day
   2. Seizure: no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity; however
   mental status poor, EEG repeated and pending. Dilantin stopped.  Keppra
   500mg in am and 250mg in pm. Continue 500mg boluses after HD.
   3. DM: On SSI + lantus 40 daily; maintain BG < 250
    -  Blood sugars in 300
s yesterday, will need adjustment of SSI
   4. Hypotension
Resolving, no pressors> 24hrs. Fluoronef and Midodrine
   tapered. Poor autonomic function given renal failure vs sepsis. [**Last Name (un) 1398**]
   stim test adequate.
   - Continue to wean Fluoronef and Midodrine as tolerated
   5. Respiratory Distress: On PSV with trach, currently [**8-22**] with FiO2
   50%
   --Attempt to trach mask.
   6. Mental Status change: Per nursing was moving L arm to commands,
   however unable to follow commands this am. Does have spontaneous
   movement of 4 extrems. Unclear underlying etiology: could be secondary
   to slow clearance of sedation or delirium of underlying infection
   versus effect of subdural hematomas.
   --Continue to hold sedation
   7. Scrotal and buttock ulcers
 most likely dependent skin ulcers.
   Herpes DFA - negative
   --continue wound care
   8. ESRD:  HD yesterday with EPO
   - Cont HD w/ femoral temp line
   - Access still L femoral line placed [**2191-9-4**].
   8. SDH
Hold anticoagulation.
   --Will get repeat EEG to see if having subclinical seizures.
   9. Glaucoma /  Cataracts: continue home eye drops.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and anuria on hemodialysis (HD), admitted for subdural hematomas (SDH) caused by seizures after a fall. The patient is currently unresponsive and has persistent fevers. 

Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient is febrile with a temperature of 102°F this morning. Cultures were re-drawn and mycologic/lytic cultures were sent. The patient had a head CT showing opacification of mastoids, sinus mucosal thickening, and hyperdense material in the left sphenoid sinus, which could be inspissated mucus or a fungal infection. The nasogastric tube (NGT) was removed.
2. Seizure: The patient had seizures, but there is no gross evidence of ongoing seizure activity at present. Mental status remains poor, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) has been repeated and is pending. Dilantin has been stopped, and Keppra has been initiated.
3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient's blood sugars have been elevated, and the dose of short-acting insulin (SSI) needs to be adjusted.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is improving, and pressors have been held. Fluoronef and Midodrine have been tapered.

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, admitted for subdural hematomas caused by seizures after a fall. He is currently unresponsive and has persistent fevers. The patient has been on a long course of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, and his sputum cultures show colonization with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. His recent head CT scan shows opacification of mastoids, sinus mucosal thickening, and hyperdense material in the left sphenoid sinus, which could be inspissated mucus or fungal infection. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and he is off antibiotics. The patient's mental status is poor, and an EEG is pending. The patient's blood sugars are elevated, and adjustments to his diabetes management should be made. He has also been experiencing hypotension but is now responding well without pressors. The patient is tolerating t-piece ventilation and may require respiratory support as needed. He has dependent skin ulcers on his scrotum and buttock, and a herpes simplex virus (HSV) test was negative. The patient continues to receive wound care. He is scheduled for hemodialysis with an EPO and a femoral temporary line. A tunneled hemodialysis line will be placed tomorrow, and a PICC line will be inserted. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   73yoM h/o ESRD anuric on HD, admitted for SDHs c/b seizures after a
   fall, was ventilated, unresponsive, and having persistent fevers
   thought to be due to drugs, but now waking up a little more, weaning
   from vent, and hasn't now had fevers since [**2191-7-13**] 8am. Also seen to
   have sinusitis and mucosal thickenings on CT sinuses.
   1. Fevers--Has had negative workup for FUO and leading thought is that
   these were drug fevers, and so all unnecessary drugs were stopped and
   Dilantin has now been tapered. WBC's were 13-14 but going down this am.
   Now with concerning CT scan, and we are treating presumed sinus
   infections.
   --F/u with ENT
   --Continue Augmentin for bacterial sinusitis
   --Continue nasal sprays
   --Plan for re-imaging in a few more days
   --Checking Cx's qod, last one collected today
   2. ESRD--To get HD today
   --Will try to hold Midodrine before/after HD today and watch bp.
   --If fails that, then Midodrine before HD on Friday
   3. Drop in Hct over last 24 hrs
   --Will repeat Hct later this afternoon
   --Increase Epo to 5000U with HD today per renal.
   --Consider transfusing with HD today but can likely f/u pm Hct and
   watch
   --Has PICC and HD line
   --Get new T&S this am
   4. Seizure: Still no e/o ongoing seizure activity. Repeat EEG [**2191-9-12**]
   still pending. Continues on Keppra 500mg in am and 250mg in pm.
   Continue 500mg boluses after HD.
   5. DM: On SSI + lantus 40 daily. BS's well controlled yesterday 100-140
   --Continue insulin regimen as is
   6. Hypotension--Not requiring pressors. Off Fluoronef and Midodrine
   parameters now decreased to sbp >100. Poor autonomic function given
   renal failure vs sepsis. [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test adequate.
   --Watch bp's through today and if continued good pressures can d/c
   Midodrine
   7. Respiratory Distress: Tolerated t-piece well and had decent ABG
   yesterday am.
   --Continue weaning vent, currently on T piece this am
   8. Mental Status change: Appears to be a little more responsive to
   stimuli but still not following commands.
   --Hold sedation
   --Keppra for seizures
   --Continue to treat underlying conditions--sinus infxn?
   9. Scrotal and buttock ulcers
 most likely dependent skin ulcers.
   Herpes DFA - negative
   --continue wound care
   10. SDH
Hold anticoagulation.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted for subdural hematomas (SDHs) caused by seizures after a fall.
- The patient was initially ventilated, unresponsive, and had persistent fevers thought to be drug-related. He is now waking up more and being weaned off the ventilator.
- He has sinusitis and mucosal thickenings on CT scan of the sinuses. The leading thought is that these fevers were drug fevers, so unnecessary drugs were stopped, and Dilantin has been tapered.
- The patient's WBC count was 13-14 but is now going down. He is being treated for presumed bacterial sinusitis with Augmentin and nasal sprays.
- He is scheduled for re-imaging in a few days.
- His ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis (HD) management, including monitoring blood pressure before and after HD sessions.
- The patient's Hct has dropped over the last 24 hours, so it will be repeated later in the afternoon. Epo will be increased to 5000U with HD today per renal. He may require a transfusion with HD today.
- His seizure activity has improved, and he continues on Keppra 500mg in the morning and 250mg in the evening. Repeat EEG is pending.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt received tunneled HD line,  PICC line, and PEG tube all yesterday.
   PEG tube draining dark bilious material when set to drainage
   ENT consulted for sinusitis seen on CT scan, nasal steroids,
   neosynephrine spray, and ABx started.
   Continues only on Keppra, no Dilantin
   Afebrile through yesterday
   RSBI 69 this am
   Transiently hypotense when PEG tube placed, received fluid bolus, but
   otherwise normotensive through day and Midodrine set to lower
   parameters
   7.38/50/70  on T piece 12L and FiO2 50%  but put back on vent overnight
   due to sedation from procedures yesterday, but back to T piece this am
   ENT feels that sinusitis on CT scan is due to obstruction by chronic NG
   tube and that this will clear once NG tube is out.  They recommended
   saline wash, nasal steroids, augmentin and re-image in 4 to 7 days.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), admitted for subdural hematomas (SDHs) following a fall. The patient was initially unresponsive, ventilated, and had persistent fevers thought to be drug-related. However, the patient is now more responsive and showing signs of weaning from the ventilator.

The patient has been diagnosed with sinusitis and mucosal thickenings on CT scan, and is being treated with augmentin and nasal sprays. The fever workup has been negative, and it is believed that the fevers were drug-related. The patient's white blood cell count has been decreasing.

The patient's ESRD requires ongoing HD, and efforts are being made to manage hypertension before and after HD. The patient's Hct has dropped over the last 24 hours, and further investigation is needed. The patient is also on Keppra for seizures, and an EEG is pending.

The patient has mental status changes and is not following commands. The underlying conditions, such as sinus infection, need to be treated. The patient also has scrotal and buttock ulcers, which are likely dependent skin ulcers, and wound care will continue. Anticoagulation will be held due to the presence of SDHs.

In terms of disposition, the patient will be transferred to a rehabilitation facility after discharge from the"

   He has improved his mental status but is still intermittently
   interactive. Does follow simple commands.  Hopefully will regain
   additional function as SDH decreases in size.  Now again off ventilator
   but cough remains poor and I doubt he can be decannulated without
   signifficant improvement in neurological fxn.  Catheters placed
   yesterday - PICC and tunnelled HD line.  Has become afebrile - suspect
   this was phenytoin exascerbated this weekend by sinusitis.  Plan for
   transfer to [**Hospital1 664**] today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The following are potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's poor nutritional status and immobilization due to respiratory failure may lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores.

2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's inability to eat orally and reliance on tube feeds increases the risk of malnutrition, which can further complicate their overall health condition.

3. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia): The patient's persistent fever despite being on antibiotics suggests a possible underlying infection or inflammatory process. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's intermittent interaction and poor responsiveness may be attributed to encephalopathy, possibly related to their underlying medical conditions or as a result of medication side effects.

5. Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD): The patient's history of renal failure and the presence of elevated creatinine levels indicate a progression towards end-stage renal disease. This will require ongoing management and may necessitate dialysis.

6. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 2]): The patient's initial respiratory failure has improved with ventilatory support but still exhibits poor cough and the inability to be decannulated. Close monitoring and additional interventions may be required to optimize respiratory function.

7. Hypoglycemia"
