   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.
   .
   1. Altered mental status
   Probably multifactorial, most likely hepatic encephalopathy may be
   exacerbated by infection. No localizing deficits worrisome for CNS
   bleed, head CT was negative on admission. Benzos may also be
   contributory. No evidence for SBP, no meningeal findings.
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Infection workup and treatment as below
   - Minimize sedating medications as possible, watching for evidence of
   withdrawal
   - Guiac stools
   - Haldol if needed for agitation
   .
   2. Bacteremia
   Awaiting further speciation, may be contaminant coag negative staph but
   need to rule out true bloodstream infection. ?Source uncertain.
   Question whether could have underlying pneumonia on left - but no clear
   consolidation on admission PA/Lat. Given EtoH at risk for an aspiration
   pna. Clinically limited evidence for infection no fever or leukocytosis
   therefore will hold off on broader pna coverage at this time.
   - Empiric vancomycin
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - Check differential
   - If S. aureus will pursue TTE
   .
   3. Tachycardia
   EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to infection versus
   alcoholic hepatitis, considering also EtoH withdrawal. Think PE is less
   likely.
   - Will follow, consider further workup if any evidence of respiratory
   distress
   .
   4. Alcoholic hepatitis
   Liver following, no plans for further steroids at this time
   - Will start enteral feeding
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   .
   5. Left sided effusion, ?hemothorax post fall
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Will hold on thoracentesis and CT for now
   - Follow Hct q6, transfuse Hct>25
   .
   6. Alcohol abuse
   Monitor per CIWA scale, use minimum of benzodiazepines required.
   - MVT/thiamine
   - Social work consult
   .
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia
   Likely secondary to marrow suppression from EtoH. Consider also
   bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also be due to splenic
   sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Retic, smear, B12, folate, iron panel
   .
   8. Coagulopathy
   Elevated INR likely secondary to liver disease
   - FFP prior to lines
   - Smear, fibrinogen for DIC workup though think this is much less
   likely

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic who presents with altered mental status following a fall. The patient has been transferred to the MICU and is currently being treated for several conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are tachycardic with a sinus tachycardia on EKG. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and there are concerns for hepatic encephalopathy, infection, alcoholic hepatitis, and a possible left-sided effusion or hemothorax from the fall. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy, as well as anemia and thrombocytopenia. The patient is on multiple medications and has a central line placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver disease and can cause altered mental status. It may be exacerbated by infection.
2. Infection: The patient has bacteremia, and there is a concern for pneumonia or a source of infection that has not yet been identified.
3. Alcoholic hepatitis: This is a potential complication of long-term alcohol abuse and can lead to liver dysfunction.
4. Left-sided effusion/hemothorax: The patient has a left-sided effusion that may be due to the fall. It is unclear if this is infected or causing significant respiratory distress.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: These are likely secondary to marrow suppression from alcohol"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic who presented with altered mental status and was transferred to the MICU.
2. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with signs of hepatic encephalopathy, possibly exacerbated by bacteremia.
3. The patient's altered mental status may also be due to benzodiazepine use, which could contribute to withdrawal symptoms.
4. No evidence of septicemia or meningitis is found.
5. The patient has a bacteremia caused by coag positive staph, and empirical treatment with vancomycin is being administered until sensitivities return.
6. The patient exhibits sinus tachycardia, likely secondary to infection, alcoholic hepatitis, and possible withdrawal.
7. The patient has alcoholic hepatitis, with no plans for further steroid use at this time.
8. There is a left-sided effusion, possibly a hemothorax post fall, but it does not seem to be interfering significantly with breathing.
9. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present, likely secondary to marrow suppression from alcohol use or bleeding from a possible fall.
10. The patient has coagulopathy, likely secondary to liver disease, and is being monitored for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hepatic encephalopathy, development of pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.
   .
   1. Altered mental status:  Most likely secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy, exacerbated by bacteremia and benzos.  No localizing
   deficits worrisome for CNS bleed, head CT was negative on admission. No
   evidence for SBP, no meningeal findings.
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia empirically
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, will switch from
   diazepam to ativan given abnormal liver function
   - Guaiac stools
   - Haldol if needed for agitation
   .
   2. Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 5227**]
   uncertain. Given EtoH at risk for an aspiration pna. Clinically limited
   evidence for infection no fever or leukocytosis therefore will hold off
   on broader pna coverage at this time.
   - Will switch from vancomycin to penicillin today
   - daily blood cultures
   - Will get TTE today to rule out endocarditis
   - Unclear source, will discuss regarding IVDU when the patient clears
   .
   3. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis, considering also EtoH withdrawal.
   Think PE is less likely.
   - Will follow, consider further workup if any evidence of respiratory
   distress
   .
   4. Alcoholic hepatitis:  Liver following, no plans for further steroids
   at this time
   - Will continue tube feeds
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   - Will start ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis
   .
   5. Left sided effusion, ?hemothorax post fall
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Will hold on thoracentesis and CT for now
   - Follow Hct q6, transfuse Hct>25
   .
   6. Alcohol abuse:  Monitor per CIWA scale, use minimum of
   benzodiazepines required given AMS.
   - MVT/thiamine
   - Social work consult
   .
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to marrow suppression
   from EtoH. Consider also bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also
   be due to splenic sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Retic, smear, B12, folate, iron panel
   - Continue to trend
   .
   8. Coagulopathy:  Worsening, likely secondary to liver disease
   - FFP prior to lines
   - Smear, fibrinogen for DIC workup though think this is much less
   likely
   - Continue to trend

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic who was admitted to the MICU with altered mental status following a fall. The patient has multiple medical complications including bacteremia, hepatic encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, tachycardia, left-sided effusion, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and potential alcohol withdrawal.

1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, exacerbated by bacteremia and benzodiazepine use. No localizing deficits worrisome for CNS bleed, and a negative head CT on admission rules out other causes. The plan includes minimizing sedating medications, treating bacteremia empirically, monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding, and considering haloperidol if needed for agitation.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has coag-positive Staphylococcus bacteremia. The source is unclear, especially considering the patient's history of intravenous drug use. Treatment includes switching from vancomycin to penicillin, daily blood cultures, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) to rule out endocarditis, and considering prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is most likely secondary to infection and alcoholic hepatitis, as well as possible ethanol withdrawal. An EKG shows sinus tachyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with MSSA bacteremia, ETOH hepatitis, and alcohol withdrawal. He is currently receiving valium for withdrawal symptoms. The patient's vitals show sinus tachycardia, with a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is slightly below normal. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,892 mL and output of 1,380 mL, with a positive balance of 112 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including vancomycin, pantoprazole, lactulose, rifaximin, and diazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is a serious infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. If left untreated or if the infection spreads, it can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
2. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient also has alcoholic hepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver due to excessive alcohol consumption. This condition can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure if not managed properly.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is receiving valium for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. If the medication is not effective or if the withdrawal symptoms are severe, it can lead to complications such as seizures,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, currently admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock. He has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and fluid balance. He has received antibiotics, including nafcillin and ceftriaxone, as well as supportive care such as Ativan for agitation and fluid boluses due to oliguria. His INR is elevated, requiring anticoagulation management with [**Last Name (LF)**] and [**First Name3 (LF)**]. The patient also has a history of cirrhosis and is at risk for complications such as renal failure, alcohol withdrawal, and delirium tremens.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's current diagnosis of MSSA bacteremia and SBP indicates a risk for ongoing infections. There is a possibility of developing new infections or having the existing ones worsen.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is already showing signs of acute renal failure, which can be exacerbated by factors like hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcoholism"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis of the liver admitted to the ICU with suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has been started on antibiotics and is currently being treated with ceftriaxone. However, no organisms were seen in the gram stain of the paracentesis sample. The patient also has bacteremia with MSSA and has been started on nafcillin. The patient's INR is elevated at 4.4, and they are in need of four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with a target INR of less than 2.5. The patient's urine output has decreased, and a 250cc bolus of D5W has been given. The patient's potassium levels have been repleted. Blood cultures were drawn, a trans thoracic echo was performed, and another paracentesis was done.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has SBP and MSSA bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Bleeding: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a prolonged clotting time. This increases the risk of bleeding, especially with procedures such as a planned PICC line placement.
3. Renal failure: The patient's urine output has decreased, and there are abnormalities in renal function tests, indicating a potential risk for acute renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.
   .
   1. Altered mental status:  Most likely secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy, exacerbated by bacteremia and benzos.  No localizing
   deficits worrisome for CNS bleed, head CT was negative on admission. No
   evidence for SBP, no meningeal findings.
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia empirically
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, will switch from
   diazepam to ativan given abnormal liver function
   - Guaiac stools
   - Haldol if needed for agitation
   .
   2. Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 5227**]
   uncertain. Given EtoH at risk for an aspiration pna. Clinically limited
   evidence for infection no fever or leukocytosis therefore will hold off
   on broader pna coverage at this time.
   - Will switch from vancomycin to penicillin today
   - daily blood cultures
   - Will get TTE today to rule out endocarditis
   - Unclear source, will discuss regarding IVDU when the patient clears
   .
   3. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis, considering also EtoH withdrawal.
   Think PE is less likely.
   - Will follow, consider further workup if any evidence of respiratory
   distress
   .
   4. Alcoholic hepatitis:  Liver following, no plans for further steroids
   at this time
   - Will continue tube feeds
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   - Will start ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis
   .
   5. Left sided effusion, ?hemothorax post fall
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Will hold on thoracentesis and CT for now
   - Follow Hct q6, transfuse Hct>25
   .
   6. Alcohol abuse:  Monitor per CIWA scale, use minimum of
   benzodiazepines required given AMS.
   - MVT/thiamine
   - Social work consult
   .
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to marrow suppression
   from EtoH. Consider also bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also
   be due to splenic sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Retic, smear, B12, folate, iron panel
   - Continue to trend
   .
   8. Coagulopathy:  Worsening, likely secondary to liver disease
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] prior to lines
   - Smear, fibrinogen for DIC workup though think this is much less
   likely
   - Continue to trend

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic who presented with altered mental status and was transferred to the MICU. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include bacteremia, hepatic encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, tachycardia, left-sided effusion, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition requires careful management due to the potential for medical complications such as renal failure, alcohol withdrawal, cirrhosis of the liver, and delirium tremens.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's current presentation includes altered mental status and a history of alcohol abuse, which can contribute to acute renal failure. It is important to monitor the patient's renal function and provide appropriate supportive care.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing symptoms that could be related to alcohol withdrawal. Monitoring the patient's vital signs and mental status is crucial to prevent complications such as seizures or delirium tremens.
3. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and the presence of alcoholic hepatitis suggest possible liver damage and cirrhosis. Further evaluation and management of liver function are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Delirium Tremens: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and altered mental status, there is a risk for delirium tremens"

   1. Altered mental status:  Most likely secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy, exacerbated by bacteremia and benzos.  No localizing
   deficits worrisome for CNS bleed, head CT was negative on admission.
   Has SBP from paracentesis yesterday-started on CTX, no meningeal
   findings.
   - Increase CTX to 2 g
   - Administer albumin 1.5 mg/kg today, followed by 1 mg/kg in 2 days on
   [**1-12**]
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia empirically with Nafcillin
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, will switch from
   diazepam to ativan yesterday given abnormal liver function
   - Guaiac stools
   - Haldol if needed for agitation
   - check bladder pressure, if >25 will do therapeutic paracentesis
   .
   2. Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 5227**]
   uncertain. Given EtoH at risk for an aspiration pna. Clinically limited
   evidence for infection no fever or leukocytosis therefore will hold off
   on broader pna coverage at this time. TTE yesterday no evidence of
   vegetation.  Likely bacteremia preceded SBP
   - Trend fevers and observe for other signs of infection.  Consider TEE
   and abdominal imaging if worsens clinically
   - Continue nafcillin
   - daily blood cultures
   - Unclear source, will discuss regarding IVDU when the patient clears
   .
   3. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis, considering also EtoH withdrawal.
   Think PE is less likely. Probable intervascular volume depletion with
   rising Cr.
   - Will follow, consider further workup if any evidence of respiratory
   distress
   - Adminster 2 L IVF
   - Check urine lytes

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.  He has been
   found to have MSSA bacteremia with hypothermia, persistent tachycardia
   and altered mental status.
   1. Altered mental status:  Most likely secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy, exacerbated by bacteremia and benzos.  No localizing
   deficits worrisome for CNS bleed, head CT was negative on admission.
   Has SBP from paracentesis-started on CTX,
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia with Nafcillin
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, will switch from ativan
   to Haldol today
   - Guaiac stools
   - check bladder pressure, if >25 will do therapeutic paracentesis
   2. MSSA Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles with unclear
   source. TTE yesterday no evidence of vegetation.  Likely bacteremia
   preceded SBP.  R Humeral prosthesis found on XR.  Currently
   hypothermic.
   - Trend fevers and observe for other signs of infection.  Consider TEE
   and abdominal imaging if worsens clinically
   - Continue Nafcillin for fortnight course ending [**2149-1-21**]
   - daily blood cultures
   - Unclear source, will discuss regarding IVDU when the patient clears
   3. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis. Probable intervascular volume
   depletion with rising Cr.
   - Check urine lytes
   4. Alcoholic hepatitis:  Liver following, no plans for further steroids
   at this time
   - Hold tube feeds in setting of high residuals, reinitiate slowly:
   consider post-pyloric tube
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   -.LFTs
   #. Acute renal failure:  The patient
s creatinine continues to rise
   with poor urine output.
   - Consult renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above
   - Continue Midodrine & Octreotide
   #. Hypernatremia: Na currently 147 with hyperchloremia.
   - Consult renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above.
   - D5W bolus today
   5. Left sided effusion, ?hemothorax post fall
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Will hold on thoracentesis and CT for now
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   6. Alcohol abuse:  Monitor per CIWA scale, use minimum of
   benzodiazepines required given AMS.
   - MVT/thiamine/folate
   - Social work consult
   .
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to marrow suppression
   from EtoH. Consider also bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also
   be due to splenic sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Retic, smear, B12, folate, iron panel
   - Continue to trend
   .
   8. Coagulopathy:  Worsening, likely secondary to liver disease
   - FFP prior to lines
   - Smear, fibrinogen for DIC workup though think this is much less
   likely
   - Continue to trend
   - 5 mg PO vitamin K

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic who presents with altered mental status following a fall and has been transferred to the MICU. The patient has MSSA bacteremia with hypothermia, persistent tachycardia, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Altered mental status: This may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, exacerbated by bacteremia and benzodiazepine use. The patient has SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and is being treated with antibiotics, lactulose, and rifaximin.

2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The source of infection is unclear, and the patient is currently hypothermic. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of infection, especially considering the patient's history of intravenous drug use (IVDU).

3. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, likely due to infection and alcoholic hepatitis. The patient also has evidence of intervascular volume depletion with rising creatinine levels.

4. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis, which is affecting the liver function. No plans for further steroid treatment are mentioned at this time.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating acute renal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the note highlights several significant events that occurred within a 24-hour period.

The patient had a PICC line started on January 10th at 6:00 PM. Blood cultures were taken on January 11th at 4:38 AM. The patient's bladder pressure was 18 mmHg, and they were attempting to identify family contacts. A left PICC was placed, and the patient's AM lytes showed a FENA of.56, resulting in a fluid challenge. The patient's urine output did not increase, and they were found to be hypothermic overnight, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F). A bare-hugger was started to address the hypothermia. Additionally, the patient was started on Octreotide and Midodrine.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics administered was Vancomycin on January 9th at 8:00 AM, followed by Ceftriaxone on January 10th at 8:00 PM, and Nafcillin on January 11th at 4:03 AM.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including Lorazepam (Ativan) on January 10th at 7:38 PM. There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history mentioned in the note.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.  He has been
   found to have MSSA bacteremia with hypothermia, persistent tachycardia
   and altered mental status.
   1. Altered mental status:  Most likely secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy, exacerbated by bacteremia and benzos.  No localizing
   deficits worrisome for CNS bleed, head CT was negative on admission.
   Has SBP from paracentesis-started on CTX,
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia with Nafcillin
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, will switch from ativan
   to Haldol today
   - Guaiac stools
   2. MSSA Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles with unclear
   source. TTE yesterday no evidence of vegetation.  Likely bacteremia
   preceded SBP.  R Humeral prosthesis found on XR.  Currently
   hypothermic.
   - Trend fevers and observe for other signs of infection.  Consider TEE
   and abdominal imaging if worsens clinically
   - Continue Nafcillin for fortnight course ending [**2149-1-21**]
   - daily blood cultures
   - Unclear source, will discuss regarding IVDU when the patient clears
   #. Acute renal failure:  The patient
s creatinine continues to rise
   with poor urine output.
   - Fluid resuscitation with LR given significant stool losses and poor
   UOP.
   - Consult renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above
   - Continue Midodrine & Octreotide
   #. Hypernatremia: Na currently 147 with hyperchloremia.  Current Free
   Water deficit: 2.1L
   - Consult renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above.
   - D5W bolus today vs. Tube feeds if feeding restored.
   #. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis. Probable intervascular volume
   depletion with rising Cr.
   - Check urine lytes
   #. Alcoholic hepatitis:  Liver following, no plans for further steroids
   at this time
   - Hold tube feeds in setting of high residuals, reinitiate slowly:
   post-pyloric tube
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   -.LFTs
   5. Left sided effusion, ?hemothorax post fall
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Will hold on thoracentesis and CT for now
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   6. Alcohol abuse:  Monitor per CIWA scale, use minimum of
   benzodiazepines required given AMS.
   - MVT/thiamine/folate
   - Social work consult
   .
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to marrow suppression
   from EtoH. Consider also bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also
   be due to splenic sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Retic, smear, B12, folate, iron panel
   - Continue to trend
   .
   8. Coagulopathy:  Worsening, likely secondary to liver disease
   - FFP prior to lines
   - Smear, fibrinogen for DIC workup though think this is much less
   likely
   - Continue to trend
   - 5 mg PO vitamin K
   FEN: Hold TF and reinitiate slowly, Replete lytes

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.  He has been
   found to have MSSA bacteremia with hypothermia, persistent tachycardia
   and altered mental status.
   1. Altered mental status:  Secondary to hepatic encephalopathy,
   exacerbated by benzos/Haldol.  No localizing deficits worrisome for CNS
   bleed, head CT was negative on admission.
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia with Nafcillin
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, will switch from ativan
   to Haldol today
   2. MSSA Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles with unclear
   source. TTE yesterday no evidence of vegetation.  Likely bacteremia
   preceded SBP.  R Humeral prosthesis found on XR.  Currently
   hypothermic.
   - Trend fevers and observe for other signs of infection.  Consider TEE
   and abdominal imaging if worsens clinically
   - Continue Nafcillin for fortnight course ending [**2149-1-21**]
   - daily blood cultures
   - Unclear source, will discuss regarding IVDU when the patient clears
   #. Acute renal failure:  The patient
s creatinine continues to rise
   with poor urine output.
   - Hold Fluids, Give volume as Blood/Albumin.
   - Consult renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above
   - Continue Midodrine & Octreotide
   #. Hypernatremia: Na currently 148 with hyperchloremia.  Current Free
   Water deficit: 2.1L
   - Consult renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above.
   - Water Bolus via Tube feeds
   #. SBP: Found to have SBP without organisms on paracentesis
   -          Ciprofloxacin IV treatment dose for 2 week
   -          Hepatology following
   #. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis. Probable intravascular volume
   depletion with rising Cr.
   - Check urine lytes
   #. Alcoholic hepatitis:  Liver following, no plans for further steroids
   at this time
   - Hold tube feeds in setting of high residuals, reinitiate slowly:
   post-pyloric tube
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   -.LFTs
   5. Left sided effusion, ?hemothorax post fall
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Will hold on thoracentesis and CT for now
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   6. Alcohol abuse:  Monitor per CIWA scale, use minimum of
   benzodiazepines required given AMS.
   - MVT/thiamine/folate
   - Social work consult
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to marrow suppression
   from EtoH. Consider also bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also
   be due to splenic sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Retic, smear, B12, folate, iron panel
   - Continue to trend
   8. Coagulopathy:  Worsening, likely secondary to liver disease.
   Bleeding from gums today
   - Give FFP today and prior to lines
   - Smear, fibrinogen for DIC workup though think this is much less
   likely
   - Continue to trend
   - 5 mg PO vitamin K

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic with a history of MSSA bacteremia, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, SBP, tachycardia, alcoholic hepatitis, left-sided effusion, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics (Nafcillin), sedatives (Haldol), and supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and SBP. There is a risk of developing further infections due to the immunocompromised state caused by alcoholic hepatitis and renal failure.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen if not properly managed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating worsening renal function. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function if not appropriately managed.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to neurological complications if not corrected.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has worsening coagulation parameters, indicating an increased risk of bleeding.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and may be at risk for alcohol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic with a history of falls and altered mental status. They were admitted to the ICU for MSSA bacteremia, hypothermia, persistent tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), tachycardia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and possible left-sided hemothorax. The patient is currently on various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and supportive care. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen with benzodiazepine use. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin.
2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, likely acquired through intravenous drug use. Nafcillin is being administered for a fortnight course, and daily blood cultures are being obtained.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and there is poor urine output. Fluid restriction and consultation with a nephrologist for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) or hemodialysis (HD) are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.  He has been
   found to have MSSA bacteremia with hypothermia, persistent tachycardia
   and altered mental status.
   1. Altered mental status:  Secondary to hepatic encephalopathy,
   exacerbated by benzos/Haldol.  No localizing deficits worrisome for CNS
   bleed, head CT was negative on admission.
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia with Nafcillin
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, will switch from ativan
   to Haldol today
   2. MSSA Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles with unclear
   source. TTE yesterday no evidence of vegetation.  Likely bacteremia
   preceded SBP.  R Humeral prosthesis found on XR.  Currently
   hypothermic.
   - Trend fevers and observe for other signs of infection.  Consider TEE
   and abdominal imaging if worsens clinically
   - Continue Nafcillin for fortnight course ending [**2149-1-21**]
   - daily blood cultures
   - Unclear source, will discuss regarding IVDU when the patient clears
   #. Acute renal failure:  The patient
s creatinine continues to rise
   with poor urine output.
   - Hold Fluids, Give volume as Blood/Albumin.
   - Consult renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above
   - Continue Midodrine & Octreotide
   #. Hypernatremia: Na currently 148 with hyperchloremia.  Current Free
   Water deficit: 2.1L
   - Consult renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above.
   - Water Bolus via Tube feeds
   #. SBP: Found to have SBP without organisms on paracentesis
   -          Ciprofloxacin IV treatment dose for 2 week
   -          Hepatology following
   #. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis. Probable intravascular volume
   depletion with rising Cr.
   - Check urine lytes
   #. Alcoholic hepatitis:  Liver following, no plans for further steroids
   at this time
   - Hold tube feeds in setting of high residuals, reinitiate slowly:
   post-pyloric tube
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   -.LFTs
   5. Left sided effusion, ?hemothorax post fall
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Will hold on thoracentesis and CT for now
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   6. Alcohol abuse:  Monitor per CIWA scale, use minimum of
   benzodiazepines required given AMS.
   - MVT/thiamine/folate
   - Social work consult
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to marrow suppression
   from EtoH. Consider also bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also
   be due to splenic sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Retic, smear, B12, folate, iron panel
   - Continue to trend
   8. Coagulopathy:  Worsening, likely secondary to liver disease.
   Bleeding from gums today
   - Give FFP today and prior to lines
   - Smear, fibrinogen for DIC workup though think this is much less
   likely
   - Continue to trend

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic who was admitted to the MICU with altered mental status. They have been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, hypothermia, persistent tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, SBP, alcoholic hepatitis, a left-sided effusion, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is a serious infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This infection can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function that occurs as a result of severe liver disease. Symptoms include confusion, altered level of consciousness, and changes in behavior.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating acute renal failure. This condition occurs when the kidneys suddenly stop working properly. It can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as toxic waste product buildup in the body.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is an abnormally high sodium level in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.  He has been
   found to have MSSA bacteremia with hypothermia, persistent tachycardia
   and altered mental status.
   1. Altered mental status:  Secondary to hepatic encephalopathy vs. ESLD
   secondary to alcoholic hepatitis, exacerbated by benzos/Haldol.  No
   localizing deficits worrisome for CNS bleed, head CT was negative on
   admission.
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia with Nafcillin
   - Change octreotide to SQ
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, on Haldol for agitation
   and most recent QTc 453.
   - Will discuss with liver which SBP treatment they prefer and with
   Albumin  of 3.9 the ability to stop the albumin [**Hospital1 7**], given the salt
   load in presence of hypernatremia
   2. MSSA Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles with unclear
   source. TTE yesterday no evidence of vegetation.  Likely bacteremia
   preceded SBP.  R Humeral prosthesis found on XR.  Currently
   hypothermic.
   - Trend fevers and observe for other signs of infection.  Consider TEE
   and abdominal imaging if worsens clinically
   - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course ending [**2149-1-21**]
   - daily blood cultures
   - Unclear source, will discuss regarding IVDU when the patient clears
   #. Acute renal failure:  The patient
s creatinine continues to rise
   with poor urine output.
   - Hold Fluids, Give volume as Blood/Albumin.
   - F/u renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above, currently not HD candidate, as no
   endpoint (not transplant candidate)
   - Continue Midodrine & Octreotide
   #. Hypernatremia: Na currently 148 with hyperchloremia.  Current Free
   Water deficit: 2.1L
   - Consult renal re: CVVH vs. HD as above.
   - Water Bolus via Tube feeds
   - 500 cc of D5W at 125/hour
   -PM lytes
   #. SBP: Found to have SBP without organisms on paracentesis
   -          Ciprofloxacin IV treatment dose for 2 week
   -          Hepatology following
   #. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis. Probable intravascular volume
   depletion with rising Cr, mixed with aggitation
   -          Check urine lytes-not pre-renal
   -          Haldol for agitation
   -          EKG while on Haldol
   5. Left sided effusion, ?hemothorax post fall-Stable
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   6. Alcohol abuse:  Monitor per CIWA scale, use minimum of
   benzodiazepines required given AMS.
   - MVT/thiamine/folate
   - Social work consult
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to marrow suppression
   from EtoH. Consider also bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also
   be due to splenic sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Continue to trend
   8. Coagulopathy:  Worsening, likely secondary to liver disease.
   Bleeding from gums today, along with hematuria.  Received Vita K in
   past with no benefit
   - Give FFP today and prior to lines
   - Continue to trend

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic who presented to the ICU with altered mental status following a fall. He has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, hypothermia, persistent tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient also has hepatic encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, and a history of alcohol abuse. He is experiencing acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and a left-sided effusion. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, indicating a risk for bleeding. Additionally, the patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has a coag-positive staph infection that may lead to septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating worsening renal function. If left untreated, this could progress to end-stage renal disease.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high levels of sodium in his blood, which can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. This condition needs to be managed carefully to prevent further complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile puts him at risk for bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent hemorrhagic events.
5. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient's history of alcohol abuse suggests alcoholic hepatitis, which can lead to liver failure if"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.  He has been
   found to have MSSA bacteremia with hypothermia, persistent tachycardia
   and altered mental status.  He remains altered but with increased
   vocalizations.
   1. Altered mental status:  Secondary to hepatic encephalopathy vs. ESLD
   (EtOH Hepatitis), exacerbated by benzos/Haldol.
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia with Nafcillin
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, on Haldol for agitation
   and most recent QTc 453.
   - D/C Albumin
   2. MSSA Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles with unclear
   source. TTE yesterday no evidence of vegetation.  Likely bacteremia
   preceded SBP.  R Humeral prosthesis found on XR.
   - Trend fevers and observe for other signs of infection.
   - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course ending [**2149-1-21**]
   - daily blood cultures
   #. Acute renal failure:  The patient
s creatinine continues to rise
   with poor urine output.
   - Hold Fluids, Give volume as Blood/Albumin.
   - Not HD candidate, as no endpoint (not transplant candidate)
   - Continue Midodrine & Octreotide SQ
   #. Hypernatremia: Resolving with Na currently 144
   - Water Bolus via Tube feeds
   - PM lytes
   #. SBP: Found to have SBP without organisms on paracentesis
   -          Ciprofloxacin IV Q24 treatment dose for 2 week
   -          Hepatology following
   #. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis. Probable intravascular volume
   depletion with rising Cr, mixed with aggitation
   -          Check urine lytes-not pre-renal
   -          Haldol for agitation
   -          EKG while on Haldol
   5. Bilateral effusion, ?hemothorax post fall-Stable
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   6. Alcohol abuse:  No longer in withdrawal window
   - D/C CIWA
   - Social work consult
   - Thiamine, Folate, Multivitamin
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to marrow suppression
   from EtoH. Consider also bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also
   be due to splenic sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Continue to trend
   8. Coagulopathy:  Worsening, likely secondary to liver disease.
   Bleeding from gums today, along with hematuria.  Received Vita K in
   past with no benefit
   - Give FFP prior to lines
   - Continue to trend
   - Vitamin Kx3 days

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic who was admitted to the MICU for altered mental status.
- The patient has MSSA bacteremia, hypothermia, persistent tachycardia, and altered mental status.
- The patient's altered mental status is secondary to hepatic encephalopathy or ESLD (EtOH Hepatitis), exacerbated by benzodiazepines/Haldol.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, hypernatremia, SBP, tachycardia, bilateral effusion (possibly hemothorax), alcohol abuse, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and a broken humeral prosthesis.
- The patient's creatinine is rising with poor urine output, and the patient has been holding fluids while giving volume as blood/albumin.
- The patient has been treated with lactulose, rifaximin, nafcillin, midodrine, and octreotide.
- The patient's sodium level is resolving, and the SBP has been treated with ciprofloxacin.
- The patient's tachycardia is likely secondary to infection and alcoholic hepatitis.
- The patient's coagulopathy is worsening, with bleeding from gums and hematuria.
- The patient's family has expressed a desire for full code status, but the medical team believes the prognosis is poor with limited therapeutic options."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5161**] is a 42 year old alcoholic who presents following a fall and
   is transferred to the MICU for altered mental status.  He has been
   found to have MSSA bacteremia with hypothermia, persistent tachycardia
   and altered mental status.  He remains altered but with increased
   vocalizations.
   1. Altered mental status:  Secondary to hepatic encephalopathy vs. ESLD
   (EtOH Hepatitis), exacerbated by benzos/Haldol.
   - NGT in place, lactulose QID and rifaximin
   - Treating bacteremia with Nafcillin
   - Minimizing sedating medications as possible, on Haldol for agitation
   and most recent QTc 453.
   - Will discuss with liver which SBP treatment they prefer and with
   Albumin  of 3.9 the ability to stop the albumin [**Hospital1 7**], given the salt
   load in presence of hypernatremia
   2. MSSA Bacteremia:  Coag positive staph in
 bottles with unclear
   source. TTE yesterday no evidence of vegetation.  Likely bacteremia
   preceded SBP.  R Humeral prosthesis found on XR.
   - Trend fevers and observe for other signs of infection.
   - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course ending [**2149-1-21**]
   - daily blood cultures
   #. Acute renal failure:  The patient
s creatinine continues to rise
   with poor urine output.
   - Hold Fluids, Give volume as Blood/Albumin.
   - Not HD candidate, as no endpoint (not transplant candidate)
   - Continue Midodrine & Octreotide
   - Change Octreotide to SQ
   #. Hypernatremia: Resolving with Na currently 144
   - Water Bolus via Tube feeds
   -PM lytes
   #. SBP: Found to have SBP without organisms on paracentesis
   -          Ciprofloxacin IV treatment dose for 2 week
   -          Hepatology following
   #. Tachycardia:  EKG shows sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to
   infection and alcoholic hepatitis. Probable intravascular volume
   depletion with rising Cr, mixed with aggitation
   -          Check urine lytes-not pre-renal
   -          Haldol for agitation
   -          EKG while on Haldol
   5. Bilateral effusion, ?hemothorax post fall-Stable
   Does not appear to be interfering significantly with breathing. Left
   sided less typical for hepatic hydrothorax. Think it is less likely
   this is infected.
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   6. Alcohol abuse:  No longer in withdrawal window
   - D/C CIWA
   - Social work consult
   7. Anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to marrow suppression
   from EtoH. Consider also bleeding given ?fall. Low platelets could also
   be due to splenic sequestration.
   - Serial Hct as above, keep T+S active
   - Continue to trend
   8. Coagulopathy:  Worsening, likely secondary to liver disease.
   Bleeding from gums today, along with hematuria.  Received Vita K in
   past with no benefit
   - Give FFP prior to lines
   - Continue to trend

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 42-year-old alcoholic who presented with altered mental status following a fall.
- He has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, hypothermia, persistent tachycardia, and altered mental status.
- The patient remains altered but with increased vocalizations.
- He has several medical conditions including hepatic encephalopathy, alcoholic liver disease (ESLD), acute renal failure, hypernatremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), bilateral pleural effusion (possibly hemothorax), alcohol abuse, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 127/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient is receiving appropriate treatment for his conditions, including antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and supportive care for renal failure and hypernatremia.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating that he does not wish to be resuscitated or placed on life support.
