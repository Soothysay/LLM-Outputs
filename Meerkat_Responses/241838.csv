   49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.2), CAD, HTN, DMII, who presents
   with dyspnea transferred to the unit for hypercarbic and hypoxic
   respiratory failure s/p intubation.
   # respiratory failure: combined hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Etiology unclear. Chronically elevated Hct suggests some level
   of chronic hypoxia, likely d/t combination of COPD and OSA. No obvious
   infection on CXR to suggest profound pna. possibly COPD exacerbation,
   though no overt wheezing noted.  Could also be in the setting of volume
   overload, but doesn't appear to have gross volume overload on exam
   - levofloxacin 750 mg x 5 day course
   - solumedrol 125 mg IV Q8H for now
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs, Q2-4H prn
   - decrease FiO2 to 60%, increase rate to 20, monitor for AutoPeep
   - propofol for sedation
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - stop heparin gtt; no evidence of PE and also PE less likely to cause
   this constellation of symptoms
   # Diabetes: well controlled according to most recent HbA1C. On
   metformin as outpt.
   - insulin SS
   # Hypertension: Continue home regimen of lisinopril and metoprolol.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, and DMII. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure after intubation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate between 88-113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/58 mmHg to 131/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and ABG results indicating respiratory acidosis.

Physical examination reveals no peripheral pulses assessed, normal skin, and no neurologic assessment performed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's condition is being managed with antibiotics, steroids, bronchodilators, and adjustments to ventilator settings. A repeat chest X-ray is planned, and the patient's code status is full code. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU.

   49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.2), CAD, HTN, DMII, who presents
   with dyspnea transferred to the unit for hypercarbic and hypoxic
   respiratory failure s/p intubation.
   # respiratory failure: combined hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Etiology unclear. Chronically elevated Hct suggests some level
   of chronic hypoxia, likely d/t combination of COPD and OSA. No obvious
   infection on CXR to suggest profound pna. possibly COPD exacerbation,
   though no overt wheezing noted.  Could also be in the setting of volume
   overload, but doesn't appear to have gross volume overload on exam

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-inch tall and 121 kg individual admitted to the ICU. They have been receiving antibiotics and are on mechanical ventilation. The patient's temperature is 37.9°C, heart rate is within normal range, blood pressure is slightly low, respiratory rate is controlled, oxygen saturation is 96%, and they are in sinus rhythm. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,276 mL (with 400 mL given IV), output of 3,735 mL (with 450 mL via blood products), urine output of 1,585 mL, NG output of 2,150 mL, and a negative fluid balance of 1,459 mL. The patient is receiving propofol infusion at 35 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a high urine output of 1,585 mL, which may indicate good renal function. However, further evaluation of the patient's renal parameters such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels would be necessary to assess for any signs of AKI.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Regular chest X-rays and cultures should be done to monitor for any signs of infection.

   Critical Care;
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 5243**] has advanced COPD with tracheobronchomalacia and bronchiolar
   occlusion with inspissated mucus ( on bronchoscopy today). He will need
   transition to CPAP/ PSV today with attempts at extubation in am [**2193-8-18**]
   if no setback over next 12-16 hrs. We will re-institute IV steroids in
   the interim until extubation and maximize MDI
s and nebs> He may very
   need mucomyst therapy (nebs) in post extubation setting to help with
   secretion clearance. His mental status is thankfully intact and he does
   not have intra-cardiac shunt)
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presents with combined hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating an infection. Sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora is also observed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels (0.8 mg/dL) suggest possible AKI.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels (221 mg/dL, 250 mg/dL, 216 mg/dL), indicating poor glycemic control.
5. Acidosis: The patient has a low TCO2 level (41 mmol/L), suggesting metabolic acidosis.
6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which may contribute to his current critical condition.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, but lisinopril is currently held.
8. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has diabetes, and insulin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, and DMII. He presents with dyspnea and was transferred to the unit for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure after intubation. The patient is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

The vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has decreased from 121 kg at admission to 115.9 kg currently.

The patient has received various medications including propofol, lansoprazole, heparin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin. The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased blood glucose, and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient has a history of pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. The plan is to continue the current antibiotics and switch from IV solumedrol to prednisone for a 4-day course. The FiO2 will be decreased to 50%, and serial chest X-rays will be followed. Leukocytosis is likely due to steroid use, and an echo with a bubble study is planned.

The patient also has diabetes, hypertension, and CAD, and their respective treatments are mentioned in the plan. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) and regular insulin sliding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, and DMII. He presents with dyspnea and is admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure following intubation. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and other supportive care measures. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/60 to 128/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. He is receiving fluids through IVF and has been given blood products. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and serial chest X-rays will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous heparin are being used.
3. Stress ulcer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recent hospitalization and an unknown chief complaint. The patient underwent a transesophageal echo due to desaturation with thick secretions, which showed no patent foramen ovale (PFO) or shunt. The patient received antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin. The patient is currently on propofol infusion and lansoprazole. Heparin sodium was initiated for DVT prophylaxis.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/60 mmHg to 128/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube and receiving mechanical ventilation in assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. The respiratory system compliance is 80 cmH2O/mL, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 62 mmH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, CAD, HTN, and DMII. He presented with dyspnea and was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure after intubation. The patient is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has decreased from 121 kg at admission to 115.9 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,493 mL and output of 1,660 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 833 mL. The patient received multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. The healthcare team should closely monitor the patient's sputum culture and perform regular chest X-rays.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as boots, subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, and early mobilization should be implemented.

   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He is awake and comfortable on PSV/ CPAP with a good cough despite low
   dose IV propafol. His CXR shows a persistent infiltrate at Left lung
   base, likely atelectasis. He has a VC of greater than 1.3 L
   We will extubate today and plan on adding mucomyst to his regimen to
   help with secretion clearance. We will continue IV steroids today and
   switch to prednisone in am [**2193-8-19**]. He may need NIPPV with sleep in
   addition to supplemental O2.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, and DMII. He presents with dyspnea and was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure after intubation. The patient is currently extubated and oxygenating and ventilating well on 4 liters of oxygen. He has been receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with combined hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and fluid overload. Although he is now extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if his underlying conditions worsen or if he develops any new complications.

2. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics for pneumonia. There is a potential for the development of drug-resistant bacteria or other infections due to prolonged antibiotic use.

3. Diabetic Complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, which puts him at risk for complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state if his blood sugar levels are not properly controlled.

4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD, which increases his risk for cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-inch tall, 114.7 kg male with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He was admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD, acidosis, and pneumonia. The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and has undergone multiple arterial line insertions.

24-hour events include the removal of an arterial line, administration of lasix, and oral prednisone. The patient's allergies are unknown. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on [**2193-8-17**] at 10:35 AM, ceftriaxone on [**2193-8-19**] at 11:00 AM, and azithromycin on [**2193-8-19**] at 12:00 PM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 93/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight is currently 114.7 kg, with a total fluid intake of 1,420 mL and a total output of 3,070 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and low potassium levels. Other lab values, including glucose levels, are within normal range.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of ///34/.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status and ABG results indicate the presence of pneumonia. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's oxygenation and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation and ABG results suggest possible development of ARDS. Close monitoring of respiratory status and potential interventions such as mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
3. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated creatinine levels could indicate an ongoing infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial for early recognition and management.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and risk factors make him susceptible to DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium infusion should be continued, and further assessment for DVT may be required.
5. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: Given the patient's ICU admission and potential for stress-related mucosal disease, stress ulcer prophylaxis should be continued to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, and DMII. He was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea and is currently experiencing hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been treated with antibiotics (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) and prednisone taper. The patient also has leukocytosis, which is likely due to steroid use. A bubble study showed no shunt. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 93/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight is currently 114.7 kg. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,420 mL (including 240 mL IVF) and an output of 3,070 mL (including 1,125 mL urine). The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count (16.6 K/uL) and creatinine level (0.8 mg/dL). The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation, acidosis, respiratory pneumonia, and other comorbidities such as CAD, HTN, and DMII.

Potential Medical Complications:
