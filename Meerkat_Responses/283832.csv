   Bloodbank in agreement that likely [**1-21**] transfusion. Patient now
   stabilized following epinephrine, H2 antagonist, steroids. Protecting
   airway without stridor or respiratory distress. No evidence of IgA
   deficiency.
   - discuss transfusion plans with bloodbank, anticipate needing washed
   products
   - f/u tryptase
   - may continue PO antihistamines standing x 3 days (today d#2) and
   changes to PO steroid today
   - zofran/compazine prn nausea
   - telemetry
   - close airway monitoring, airway cart in room. anesthesia aware and in
   agreement with this plan.
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Not bleeding currently , platelets at 6 this AM. Felt to be [**1-21**] ITP/SLE
   by heme. No evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia on heme
   review of peripheral smear (eg TTP, HUS, DIC), no blasts or other
   abnormal WBCs worrisome for malignant infiltration.
   - talk to heme/blood bank regarding whether needs another plt
   transfusion with washed platelets here in ICU
   - can try amicar per blood bank recs
   - will hold on further plt transfusion for now given anaphylactic
   reaction. transfusion goal will be >10k
   - change to PO prednisone 1mg/kg daily per heme/onc recs
   - hold all antiplatelets
   - trend CBC daily
   - HIV consent in the AM when stabilized
   - maintain active t+s, piv x2, following cbc [**Hospital1 **]
   - no focal deficits on neuro exam therefore will HOLD on CT head at
   this time, but low threshold to check this
   .
   * Acute blood loss anemia
   Hct stable from [**2163**], though more recent CBC unavailable at this time.
   No evidence of hemolytic process on hematology review of peripheral
   smear. Ferritin of 13 c/w iron deficiency.
   - follow cbc daily Q6, transfuse Hct >25 or active bleeding
   - iron supplements
   .
   * Epistaxis
   No significant bleeding here.
   - consider ENT evaluation and packing if rebleeds
   .
   * Elevated lactate
   Likely due to hypoperfusing state in setting of anaphylaxis. Unlikely
   sepsis.

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with sarcoid-variant SLE who presents with epistaxis and menorrhagia in the context of thrombocytopenia. She experienced anaphylaxis, likely due to a transfusion, and was stabilized with epinephrine, H2 antagonist, and steroids. She is currently stable without respiratory distress or stridor, but has purpuric lesions on the buccal mucosa and lip swelling. 

The patient's lab results show low platelet count (6 K/uL), low hemoglobin (11.1 g/dL), elevated lactate (3.8 mmol/L), and elevated PT/PTT/INR levels. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.9 C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 95/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Anaphylaxis: The patient is at risk for another anaphylactic transfusion reaction. She should only receive washed blood products. She will be monitored closely, and further evaluation of tryptase levels is recommended.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, but she is not currently bleeding. It is believed to be immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)/SLE-related. She does not have evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or malignant infiltration. She should be given amicar and considered for another platelet transfusion with washed platelets. She will be started on PO prednisone 1 mg/kg daily and all antiplatelet medications will be held. Daily CBC trends are advised.
3. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, although recent CBC results are not available. There is no evidence of a hemolytic process. She should have daily CBC checks, and transfusion should be considered if Hct drops below 25 or if there is active bleeding. Iron supplements may also be necessary.
4. Epistaxis: The patient has had epistaxis, but it is not currently significant. If she experiences further bleeding, consideration should be given to an ENT evaluation and packing.
5. Elevated lactate: The elevated lactate levels are likely due to the hypoperfusing state during anaphylaxis. There is no evidence of sepsis.
6. SLE: The patient appears to be off specific SLE treatment. Further records from outpatient providers are needed, and rheum follow-up is required.
7. Knee pain: The patient's knee pain could be related to SLE. However, it is not currently associated with inflammation. In the setting of thrombocytopenia, hemarthrosis should also be considered, although it is less likely.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is being fed a regular diet, and her glycemic control will be managed with steroids due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers is being provided. The patient's status is full code, and she will be dispositioned to the ICU for platelet transfusion. If stable, she can be transferred to the floor."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of sarcoid-variant systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presenting with epistaxis (nosebleed) and menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding). The patient experienced anaphylaxis after a blood transfusion and is currently stable. Vital signs are within normal range, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Physical examination reveals purpuric lesions on the buccal mucosa, lip swelling, petechiae, and clear lungs. The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), elevated lactate levels, and other abnormalities. The patient has been treated with epinephrine, H2 antagonist, steroids, and antihistamines. The plan includes discussing transfusion plans with the bloodbank, using washed blood products, monitoring for signs of anaphylaxis, and closely monitoring the airway.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anaphylaxis: The patient has already experienced anaphylaxis due to a blood transfusion. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, swelling, hives, or low blood pressure. If these symptoms occur, immediate medical intervention is necessary.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding."

   epistaxis and menorrhagia in the context of thrombocytopenia.
   .
   * Anaphylaxis
   Bloodbank in agreement that likely [**1-21**] transfusion. Patient now
   stabilized following epinephrine, H2 antagonist, steroids. Protecting
   airway without stridor or respiratory distress. No evidence of IgA
   deficiency.
   - discuss transfusion plans with bloodbank, anticipate needing washed
   products
   - f/u tryptase
   - may continue PO antihistamines standing x 3 days (today d#2) and
   changes to PO steroid today
   - zofran/compazine prn nausea
   - telemetry
   - close airway monitoring, airway cart in room. anesthesia aware and in
   agreement with this plan.
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Not bleeding currently , platelets at 6 this AM. Felt to be [**1-21**] ITP/SLE
   by heme. No evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia on heme
   review of peripheral smear (eg TTP, HUS, DIC), no blasts or other
   abnormal WBCs worrisome for malignant infiltration.
   - talk to heme/blood bank regarding whether needs another plt
   transfusion with washed platelets here in ICU
   - can try amicar per blood bank recs
   - will hold on further plt transfusion for now given anaphylactic
   reaction. transfusion goal will be >10k
   - change to PO prednisone 1mg/kg daily per heme/onc recs
   - hold all antiplatelets
   - trend CBC daily
   - HIV consent in the AM when stabilized
   - maintain active t+s, piv x2, following cbc [**Hospital1 **]
   - no focal deficits on neuro exam therefore will HOLD on CT head at
   this time, but low threshold to check this
   .
   * Acute blood loss anemia
   Hct stable from [**2163**], though more recent CBC unavailable at this time.
   No evidence of hemolytic process on hematology review of peripheral
   smear. Ferritin of 13 c/w iron deficiency.
   - follow cbc daily Q6, transfuse Hct >25 or active bleeding
   - iron supplements
   .
   * Epistaxis
   No significant bleeding here.
   - consider ENT evaluation and packing if rebleeds
   .
   * Elevated lactate
   Likely due to hypoperfusing state in setting of anaphylaxis. Unlikely
   sepsis.
   Improved on repeat last night.
   .
   * SLE
   Apparently not on any specific SLE treatment at this time
   - Obtain further records from outpt providers, needs rheum followup
   .
   * Knee pain
   Could be SLE related. However, joints to not appear inflamed at this
   time. In setting of thrombocytopenia, consider also hemarthrosis,
   though think this is less likely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of sarcoid-variant SLE presenting with epistaxis and menorrhagia in the context of thrombocytopenia. She experienced anaphylaxis and was stabilized following administration of epinephrine, H2 antagonist, and steroids. The patient's airway is being protected, and she is currently stable without stridor or respiratory distress. There is no evidence of IgA deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anaphylaxis: The patient has already experienced anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, and shock. It is important to continue monitoring her for any signs of another anaphylactic reaction, especially during transfusion or exposure to potential allergens.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of her platelet levels and bleeding symptoms is necessary. She may require additional platelet transfusion or treatment with medications like amicar to prevent further bleeding.

3. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's Hct level is stable, but there is a possibility of developing acute blood loss anemia due to ongoing or future bleeding episodes. Regular monitoring of her CBC and timely transfusion of packed red blood cells may be required to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of lupus and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). She presented to the emergency department with epistaxis, menstrual bleeding, and purpuric sores in her mouth. Her platelet count was 6. Hematology evaluated her and diagnosed her with ITP. She was admitted to the medicine floor and received platelet transfusions when she developed facial swelling, nausea, and transient unresponsiveness. She improved with epinephrine, famotidine, and steroids, and was transferred to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anaphylaxis: The patient experienced symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, including facial swelling, nausea, and transient unresponsiveness. She responded well to treatment with epinephrine, famotidine, and steroids.
2. ITP: The patient has a diagnosis of ITP, which is characterized by low platelet counts leading to bleeding. She presented with mucosal bleeding and is currently being managed with platelet transfusions and monitoring by the hematology service.
3. Lupus: The patient has a history of lupus, but the current note does not provide specific information about active lupus-related symptoms or complications. It is mentioned that she will need to establish outpatient follow-up with rheumatology.
4. Nosebleeds: The patient initially presented with epistaxis (nosebleeds). Although she is currently"

   HPI:
   45 yo F with lupus and dx of ITP previously on prednisone who initially
   presented to ED with 3 days epistaxis and menstrual bleeding as well as
   purpuric sores in mouth.  Her platelet count was 6.  Hematology saw her
   the emergency department with now evidence of hemolysis.  It was felt
   that she had ITP and steroids were recommended.  She was admitted to
   medicine floor, and was receiving platelets when she developed facial
   swelling, nausea, transient unresponsiveness.  She improved with
   epipen, famotidine, solumedrol and transferred to ICU

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2439**] is a 45F with sarcoid-variant SLE who presents with
   epistaxis and menorrhagia in the context of thrombocytopenia.
   .
   * Anaphylaxis
   Bloodbank in agreement that likely [**1-21**] transfusion. Patient now
   stabilized following epinephrine, H2 antagonist, steroids. Protecting
   airway without stridor or respiratory distress. No evidence of IgA
   deficiency.
   - discuss transfusion plans with bloodbank, anticipate needing washed
   products
   - f/u tryptase
   - may continue PO antihistamines standing x 3 days (today d#2) and
   changes to PO steroid today
   - zofran/compazine prn nausea
   - telemetry
   - close airway monitoring, airway cart in room. anesthesia aware and in
   agreement with this plan.
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Not bleeding currently , platelets at 6 this AM. Felt to be [**1-21**] ITP/SLE
   by heme. No evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia on heme
   review of peripheral smear (eg TTP, HUS, DIC), no blasts or other
   abnormal WBCs worrisome for malignant infiltration.
   - talk to heme/blood bank regarding whether needs another plt
   transfusion with washed platelets here in ICU
   - can try amicar per blood bank recs
   - will hold on further plt transfusion for now given anaphylactic
   reaction. transfusion goal will be >10k
   - change to PO prednisone 1mg/kg daily per heme/onc recs
   - hold all antiplatelets
   - trend CBC daily
   - HIV consent in the AM when stabilized
   - maintain active t+s, piv x2, following cbc [**Hospital1 **]
   - no focal deficits on neuro exam therefore will HOLD on CT head at
   this time, but low threshold to check this
   .
   * Acute blood loss anemia
   Hct stable from [**2163**], though more recent CBC unavailable at this time.
   No evidence of hemolytic process on hematology review of peripheral
   smear. Ferritin of 13 c/w iron deficiency.
   - follow cbc daily Q6, transfuse Hct >25 or active bleeding
   - iron supplements
   .
   * Epistaxis
   No significant bleeding here.
   - consider ENT evaluation and packing if rebleeds
   .
   * SLE
   Apparently not on any specific SLE treatment at this time
   - Obtain further records from outpt providers, needs rheum followup
   .
   * Knee pain

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 2439] is a 45-year-old female with sarcoid-variant SLE presenting with epistaxis and menorrhagia in the context of thrombocytopenia. She has a history of anaphylaxis, thrombocytopenia, acute blood loss anemia, epistaxis, SLE, and knee pain. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Anaphylaxis: Patient stabilized following epinephrine, H2 antagonist, steroids. Protecting airway without stridor or respiratory distress. No evidence of IgA deficiency.
   - Discuss transfusion plans with bloodbank, anticipate needing washed products
   - Follow up on tryptase
   - Continue PO antihistamines standing x 3 days (today d#2) and changes to PO steroid today
   - Zofran/Compazine prn nausea
   - Telemetry
   - Close airway monitoring, airway cart in room. Anesthesia aware and in agreement with this plan.

2. Thrombocytopenia: Not bleeding currently, platelets at 6 this AM. Felt to be [1-21] ITP/SLE by heme. No evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia on heme review of peripheral smear (e.g. TTP, HUS, DIC), no blasts or other abnormal WBCs worrisome for malignant infiltration.
   - Talk to heme/blood bank regarding whether needs another plt transfusion with washed platelets here in ICU
   - Can try amicar per blood bank recs
   - Will hold on further plt transfusion for now given anaphylactic reaction. Transfusion goal will be >10k
   - Change to PO prednisone 1mg/kg daily per heme/onc recs
   - Hold all antiplatelets
   - Trend CBC daily
   - HIV consent in the AM when stabilized
   - Maintain active t+s, piv x2, following cbc [Hospital1]
   - No focal deficits on neuro exam therefore will HOLD on CT head at this time, but low threshold to check this.

3. Acute blood loss anemia: Hct stable from [2163], though more recent CBC unavailable at this time. No evidence of hemolytic process on hematology review of peripheral smear. Ferritin of 13 c/w iron deficiency.
   - Follow cbc daily Q6, transfuse Hct >25 or active bleeding
   - Iron supplements

4. Epistaxis: No significant bleeding here.
   - Consider ENT evaluation and packing if rebleeds

5. SLE: Apparently not on any specific SLE treatment at this time
   - Obtain further records from outpt providers, needs rheum followup

6. Knee pain: Could be SLE related. However, joints do not appear infl"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of anaphylactic shock. The patient has been receiving ICU care and various medications, including famotidine (Pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 123/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -690 mL and urine output of 2,800 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal WBC count, Hct levels, and platelet count, but slightly elevated glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding, such as petechiae, purpura, or frank bleeding, should be conducted.

2. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and use of invasive lines increase the risk of developing healthcare-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU setting can lead to the development of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings and early mobilization"

 SHOCK, ANAPHYLACTIC (ANAPHYLAXIS)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2439**] is a 45F with sarcoid-variant SLE who presents with
   epistaxis and menorrhagia in the context of thrombocytopenia.
   .
   * Anaphylaxis
   Bloodbank in agreement that likely [**1-21**] transfusion. Patient now
   stabilized following epinephrine, H2 antagonist, steroids. Protecting
   airway without stridor or respiratory distress. No evidence of IgA
   deficiency.
   - discuss transfusion plans with bloodbank, anticipate needing washed
   products
   - f/u tryptase
   - may continue PO antihistamines standing x 3 days (today d#2) and
   changes to PO steroid today
   - zofran/compazine prn nausea
   - telemetry
   - close airway monitoring, airway cart in room. anesthesia aware and in
   agreement with this plan.
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Not bleeding currently , platelets at 6 this AM. Felt to be [**1-21**] ITP/SLE
   by heme. No evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia on heme
   review of peripheral smear (eg TTP, HUS, DIC), no blasts or other
   abnormal WBCs worrisome for malignant infiltration.
   - talk to heme/blood bank regarding whether needs another plt
   transfusion with washed platelets here in ICU
   - can try amicar per blood bank recs
   - will hold on further plt transfusion for now given anaphylactic
   reaction. transfusion goal will be >10k
   - change to PO prednisone 1mg/kg daily per heme/onc recs
   - hold all antiplatelets
   - trend CBC daily
   - HIV consent in the AM when stabilized
   - maintain active t+s, piv x2, following cbc [**Hospital1 **]
   - no focal deficits on neuro exam therefore will HOLD on CT head at
   this time, but low threshold to check this
   .
   * Acute blood loss anemia (Epistaxis / vaginal/ BM)
   Hct stable from [**2163**], though more recent CBC unavailable at this time.
   No evidence of hemolytic process on hematology review of peripheral
   smear. Ferritin of 13 c/w iron deficiency.
   - follow cbc daily Q6, transfuse Hct >25 or active bleeding
   - iron supplements
   .
   * SLE
   Apparently not on any specific SLE treatment at this time
   - Obtain further records from outpt providers, needs rheum followup and
   work up
   .
   * Knee pain
   Could be SLE related. However, joints to not appear inflamed at this
   time. In setting of thrombocytopenia, consider also hemarthrosis,
   though think this is less likely.
   - Follow exam
   - [**Month (only) 8**] use acetaminophen if needed for pains

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with sarcoid-variant systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who presents with epistaxis and menorrhagia in the context of thrombocytopenia. The patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction following a blood product transfusion, which has been stabilized. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Anaphylactic shock: The patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction after receiving a blood product transfusion. She has been stabilized with epinephrine, H2 antagonist, and steroids. Close monitoring of the patient's airway and respiratory status is essential to prevent further complications.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating thrombocytopenia. This could be due to immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or SLE-related thrombocytopenia. Further evaluation and discussion with the hematology department are necessary to determine the appropriate management plan.

3. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has experienced blood loss from epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, and possibly menorrhagia. Her hematocrit (Hct) level is stable, but the recent CBC results are not available. There is no evidence of a hemolytic process on the peripheral smear. Close monitoring of the patient's Hct levels and transfusing"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 45-year-old African American woman, is admitted to the MICU with anaphylaxis during a platelet transfusion. She was previously on the floor for thrombocytopenia due to ITP. The patient tolerated one unit of washed platelets this morning without any reactions. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/69 to 151/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on mechanical ventilation support but not on oxygen supplementation.

The patient has a history of sarcoid-variant SLE and is not currently receiving specific SLE treatment. Her physical examination reveals petechiae on her limbs, which are improving. Her lab results show low platelet count (<5 K/uL), low hemoglobin (7.9 g/dL), and elevated lactate acid levels (3.8 mmol/L). Other lab values such as WBC, Hct, Cr, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Anaphylaxis: The patient experienced an initial episode of anaphylaxis during a platelet transfusion. She tolerated one unit of washed platelets without any evidence of anaphylaxis. It is recommended to follow up with heme and bloodbank, measure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with sarcoid-variant systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for anaphylaxis during a platelet transfusion on the floor. She tolerated one unit of washed platelets in the morning without any evidence of anaphylaxis. The patient has thrombocytopenia ranging from less than 5 to 6 platelets, with ongoing heavy menstrual bleeding and occasional clots from the nose. There is concern for spontaneous intracranial bleed, so one unit of washed platelets was transfused after consultation with a hematology fellow and blood bank fellow overnight. The platelet count increased to 24 after the transfusion, although this improvement is likely to be transient due to immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The patient continues to have acute blood loss anemia from epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, and menorrhagia. Her hematocrit (Hct) has remained stable at 23-24, and no red blood cells (RBCs) have been given during this admission. The patient is on telemetry while still bleeding, and her vital signs are stable. She is also being monitored for any potential complications related to her SLE, such as lupus anticoagulant."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of discoid lupus who presented with mucosal bleeding and was found to have a platelet count of less than 5, likely due to immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). She experienced an anaphylactic reaction after receiving platelets and was transferred to the ICU. In the ICU, she received 1 unit of washed platelets which she tolerated well. Her vital signs are stable, but she is critically ill. She has been diagnosed with ITP and is being treated accordingly. She also has a possible case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for any signs of bleeding is necessary.
2. Anaphylaxis: Although the patient tolerated the recent transfusion of washed platelets well, there is still a risk of anaphylactic reaction with future transfusions or exposure to allergens.
3. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state, she may be at an increased risk of infections. Strict infection control measures should be implemented.
4. Thrombosis: Although less likely given her current critical condition, SLE patients are at an increased risk of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Prophylaxis may be considered.
5. Organ dysfunction: The"

She experienced an anaphylactic reaction after receiving platelets and was transferred to the ICU. Since then, she has received washed platelets and tolerated it well. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/79 to 151/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on mechanical ventilation support. The patient's laboratory results show low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal glucose levels. The assessment and plan include managing ITP with continued platelet transfusion, monitoring for bleeding, and following up with hematology and blood bank input. The patient also needs to be monitored for possible complications related to anaphylaxis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Due to the extremely low platelet count, the patient is at a high risk for bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Anaphylaxis: Although the patient tolerated washed platelets well, there is still a possibility of future"
