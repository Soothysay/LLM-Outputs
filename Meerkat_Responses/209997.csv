","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with a history of CVA, CAD, HTN, and HL who was admitted with choledocholithiasis/cholecystitis. The patient underwent ERCP stent placement but is currently septic and intubated. The patient is awaiting percutaneous cholecystostomy.

The assessment and plan indicate the following potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp. The patient is septic, and there is a concern for ongoing infection due to choledocholithiasis/cholecystitis. The plan is for percutaneous cholecystostomy tube for decompression of the gallbladder.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for acute respiratory failure, and the plan is to attempt weaning from the ventilator once the patient is stabilized hemodynamically.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has an unclear baseline renal function, and there are concerns for pre-renal azotemia due to hypotension. The plan includes IV fluids as needed, considering urine output, and monitoring for any changes in renal function.

4. Cholecystitis/Cholangitis: The patient had stent placement during ERCP, but there is concern for significant infection due to the presence of large amounts of"

He has been experiencing episodes of hypotension that is fluid responsive. The plan is for a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube for decompression of the gallbladder. He is currently receiving IV Zosyn, IV fluids, FFP, and Vit K due to elevated INR prior to ERCP as per surgical recommendation. Follow-up cultures have also been ordered.

The patient is also being managed for ARF, likely pre-renal in the setting of hypotensive episodes. He will continue receiving IVFs for now before the procedure, and urine lytes may be considered. Renally dose medications will be monitored, and uop will be closely monitored as well.

His medical history includes CVA/CAD/PVD, and he will discuss with the surgical team regarding ASA. A baseline ECG will be obtained. He should continue taking simvastatin for HL. His hypertension medications will be held in the setting of transient hypotension in the ED, and beta-blockers (BB) will be considered. There is a question about possible COPD, and he will continue with home inhalers. His BPH medication will be restarted.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition via NPO, glycemic control, and monitoring of vital signs. He has two lines placed: a "

   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions, f/u cx
s may be able to
   narrow antibiotic coverage to ampicillin with further speciation from

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with a history of CVA, CAD, HTN, and HL. He was admitted with choledocholithiasis/cholecystitis and had an ERCP stent placement. He is currently septic, intubated, and awaiting a percutaneous cholecystostomy. The patient has been aggressively fluid-resuscitated since arrival, receiving over 8L of IVF since admission. He has an arterial line in place and has not needed pressors since the post-ERCP period. The patient's MAPs were generally between 70-80. He received IV Zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin due to concerns of possible PNA. Blood cultures were repeated today, and cultures from the percutaneous cholecystomy placement will be followed up. A prolonged course of antibiotics with PICC placement is planned. The patient was successfully extubated this morning after weaning off sedation and ventilation/oxygenation improved post-Lasix administration. His urine output responded briskly, and his oxygenation significantly improved, along with his blood pressure. This suggests that he may have been volume overloaded and on the downward slope of his Starling curve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently septic secondary to cholangitis following ERCP and percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement for decompression of the gallbladder. The presence"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp.  Plan is for percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube for decompression of gallbladder. Briefly on neo
   post/op but weaned off with good MAPs.
   - A- line to monitor for MAPs > 65 levophed/vasopressin if needed
   - Central line placement today
   - Monitor CVP; IVFs to maintain CVP > [**11-10**], and give
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions
   - Plan for IR bedside cholecystostomy to decompress inflamed
   gallbladder
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient can likely be weaned from vent once patient
   is acutely stabilized hemodynamically.
   - Attempt to wean from vent later today
   - Send sputum cultures as patient has increased secretions
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as
   has decreased uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - Consider urine lytes
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis.
   - continue zosyn
   - IR placement of cholecystomy drain today to decompress gall bladder
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now that he can take po meds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and hearing loss (HL). He was admitted with choledocholithiasis/cholecystitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) stent placement. The patient is currently septic, intubated, and being treated for acute cholecystitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has secondary sepsis due to cholangitis following the ERCP. The plan is for a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to decompress the gallbladder. The patient will be monitored for mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 and may receive vasopressor support if needed.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a concern for acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and weaning from the ventilator will be attempted once the patient is hemodynamically stable.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with an unclear baseline renal function. It is likely pre-renal in nature due to hypotension. The patient received a large volume of intravenous fluids, which led to improvement in urine output. Renal dosing of"

   received over 8L of IVF since admission on the evening of [**11-21**]
   - A- line in place, has not needed pressors since post ERCP on [**11-22**]
   - Deferred central line placement since patient has not needed
   pressors, MAPs were generally between 70-80
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions
   - f/u cultures from percutaneous cholecystomy placement
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient was weaned overnight and changed to PSV,
   ventilation/oxygenation improved post lasix administration which he
   received due to decreased UOP, JVP to the mandible and pulmonary edema
   on CXR
UOP responded briskly, patient
s oxygenation improved
   significantly and his BP improved, making it likely that he was
   overloaded and on the downward slope of his Starling curve
   - patient
s sedation was weaned and he was successfully extubated this
   morning
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline, but Cr has decreased from 1.4 on admission to
   1.1 today. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as has decreased
   uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis given
   findings of increased gall bladder wall thickness and pericholecysitc
   fluid.  Patient is s/p percutaneous cholecystomy tube placement by IR
   yesterday afternoon, which has been draining brown fluid since that
   time.
   - continue zosyn pending further culture data
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB.  Bradycardia
   has been improving with weaning sedation.
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now that he can take po meds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CVA, CAD, HTN, and HL admitted to the ICU with choledocholithiasis/cholecystitis post ERCP stent placement. The patient is currently septic, intubated, and awaiting percutaneous cholecystostomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to cholangitis post ERCP and percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy are being provided.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There has been improvement in oxygenation and ventilation after administration of Lasix, indicating fluid overload.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline renal function is unclear, but serum creatinine has decreased from 1.4 on admission to 1.1 today. It is likely pre-renal in nature due to hypotension, with decreased urine output and increasing BUN/Cr ratio.
4. Cholecystitis/Cholangitis: The patient has significant infection in the gallbladder and biliary tree, as evidenced by pus from the common bile duct. A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube has been placed, and cultures are pending.
5. History of CVA/CAD"

   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp and percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube placement for decompression of gallbladder.
   - Briefly on neo post/op but weaned off with good MAPs since that time,
   patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated since arrival,
   received over 8L of IVF since admission on the evening of [**11-21**]
   - A- line in place, has not needed pressors since post ERCP on [**11-22**]
   - Deferred central line placement since patient has not needed
   pressors, MAPs were generally between 70-80
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions, f/u cx
s may be able to
   narrow antibiotic coverage to ampicillin with further speciation from
   perc tube, will need a prolonged course with PICC placement, which
   cannot be placed until blood cx
s are negative for over 24 hours
   - repeat blood cultures today
   - f/u cultures from percutaneous cholecystomy placement
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up culture speciation

   # ARF: Unclear baseline, but Cr has decreased from 1.4 on admission to
   1.1 today. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as has decreased
   uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop

   # HL: restart simvastatin when taking po meds
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB.  Bradycardia
   has been improving with weaning sedation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CVA, CAD, HTN, and HL admitted for choledocholithiasis/cholecystitis. The patient underwent an ERCP stent placement and is currently septic, intubated, and awaiting percutaneous cholecystostomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently septic secondary to cholangitis after the ERCP procedure. Aggressive fluid resuscitation has been provided, and the patient is receiving IV antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin). Blood cultures will be repeated today to narrow antibiotic coverage based on speciation.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient was successfully extubated this morning after being weaned from mechanical ventilation overnight. The patient's oxygenation improved significantly after receiving Lasix, suggesting fluid overload. Close monitoring of urine output is required.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline renal function is unclear, but creatinine has decreased from 1.4 on admission to 1.1 today. Pre-renal azotemia is likely due to hypotension, evidenced by decreased urine output and increasing BUN/Cr ratio. Renal dosing of medications is necessary, and urine output should be monitored.

   84 y/o gentleman transferred from WRX VA with RUQ pain and concern of
   choledolcholithiasis.  Was having RUQ pain on and off since late
   [**Month (only) 435**], and admitted for rigors, nausea, vomiting but negative work-up
   for cholecystitis beofre being sent home a month ago.  Recently found
   to have cholilithiasis. [**11-19**] had abdominal pain with nausea,
   chills/rigors.  He went to [**Hospital **] hospital [**11-21**], had elevated
   transaminases and a biliburin of 4.7, U/S c/w acute cholecystitis.
   Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care. [**11-22**] was intubated
   pre-ERCP. Procedure required incision at papilla due to inability to
   pass wire past obstructing stone. Stent was placed and pus drained.
   Post ERCP was hypotensive, now requiring neo.

   discuss with surgery re: their plans and possibility to transfer back
   to VA. Will continue Zosyn for GI coverage at least [**1-31**] more days but
   will need at least 14 day course of amp or vanc for enterococcus
   coverage. C/w Vanco for now. His renal insufficiency appears resolved,
   was volume related. Code status will need to be readdressed. Was DNR

   enterococcus in blood, also GPC in fluid [**11-22**].
   Impression
   Sepsis and enterococcal bacteremia secondary to cholangitis +/-
   cholecystitis. Had successful ERCP and perc chole drain yesterday. Will
   discuss with surgery re: their plans and possibility to transfer back
   to VA. Will continue Zosyn for GI coverage at least [**1-31**] more days but
   will need at least 14 day course of amp or vanc for enterococcus
   coverage. C/w Vanco for now. His renal insufficiency appears resolved,
   was volume related. Code status will need to be readdressed. Was DNR
   prior to procedure.
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp and percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube placement for decompression of gallbladder.
   - Briefly on neo post/op but weaned off with good MAPs since that time,
   patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated since arrival,
   received over 8L of IVF since admission on the evening of [**11-21**]
   - A- line in place, has not needed pressors since post ERCP on [**11-22**]
   - Deferred central line placement since patient has not needed
   pressors, MAPs were generally between 70-80
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions, f/u cx
s may be able to
   narrow antibiotic coverage to ampicillin with further speciation from
   perc tube, will need a prolonged course with PICC placement, which
   cannot be placed until blood cx
s are negative for over 24 hours
   - repeat blood cultures today
   - f/u cultures from percutaneous cholecystomy placement
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up culture speciation
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient was weaned overnight and changed to PSV,
   ventilation/oxygenation improved post lasix administration which he
   received due to decreased UOP, JVP to the mandible and pulmonary edema
   on CXR
UOP responded briskly, patient
s oxygenation improved
   significantly and his BP improved, making it likely that he was
   overloaded and on the downward slope of his Starling curve
   - patient
s sedation was weaned and he was successfully extubated this
   morning
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline, but Cr has decreased from 1.4 on admission to
   1.1 today. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as has decreased
   uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis given
   findings of increased gall bladder wall thickness and pericholecysitc
   fluid.  Patient is s/p percutaneous cholecystomy tube placement by IR
   yesterday afternoon, which has been draining brown fluid since that
   time.
   - continue zosyn pending further culture data from cholecystomy tube
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: restart simvastatin when taking po meds
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB.  Bradycardia
   has been improving with weaning sedation.
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now when he can take po meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other medical conditions. He was admitted with right upper quadrant pain and concern of choledocholithiasis. The patient had previous episodes of RUQ pain, nausea, chills, and vomiting but had negative work-ups for cholecystitis before being sent home a month ago. On [11-19], he experienced abdominal pain with nausea and chills/rigors. He was transferred to another hospital on [11-21] for further care, where he underwent an ERCP procedure that required incision at the papilla due to an obstructing stone. A stent was placed, and pus was drained. Post-ERCP, the patient was hypotensive and required intubation.

The patient's past medical history includes a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, colon polyps, diverticulitis, a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGI), psoriasis, erectile dysfunction (ED), and left carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The patient also has a history of cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis.

The patient's current vital signs include a blood pressure of 171/77 mmHg, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 3 liters of oxygen. The patient is alert and oriented, with hoarseness of voice. His lungs have expiratory wheezes, and his abdomen is soft with mild RUQ tenderness. A pigtail catheter is in place.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.7 thousand/mm3 (down from 28 thousand/mm3), with notable findings of enterococcus in the blood and GPC in the fluid on [11-22]. The patient's creatinine has decreased from 1.4 mg/dL on admission to 1.1 mg/dL today.

Impressions:
1. Sepsis and enterococcal bacteremia secondary to cholangitis +/- cholecystitis.
2. Successful ERCP and percutaneous cholecystostomy drain placement yesterday.
3. Patient was intubated overnight for respiratory failure but extubated this morning.
4. Hypotension resolved after Lasix administration, which improved oxygenation and urine output.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF) - unclear baseline, but creatinine has decreased from 1.4 mg/dL on admission to 1.1 mg/dL today, likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension.

   pus from common bile duct.
   HYPERTENSION -- continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary.  Patient bradycardic with BB and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. It is important to continue the current management plan to control the infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure post-extubation but is now stable with underlying COPD. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure proper oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has improved from an initial creatinine level of 1.4 on admission to 1.1 today. It is unclear if this represents pre-renal failure due to hypotension. Monitoring urine output (uop) and adjusting medication dosages accordingly will be important for ongoing management.

4. Cholecystitis-Cholangitis: The patient had cholangitis secondary to cholecystitis, which was treated with stent placement. Pus from the common bile duct was drained, and ongoing monitoring is required to ensure resolution of the infection.

5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension has been managed by holding home anti-hypertensive medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to determine if and when to reintroduce these medications.

6. Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing bradycardia, which has improved with weaning of sedation. Holding beta-blockers and monitoring heart rate"
