   EGD [**1-7**];
   Clotted blood was seen in the colon. The distal polypectomy site could
   not be located due to clot and stool, however there appeared to be less
   blood more proximal to the decending colon suggesting that this is the
   bleeding source. No active bleeding was seen.
   Recommendations: serial hematocrits; golytely prep for colonoscopy now.
   If pt rebleeds, colonoscopy once prep is complete. If no rebleeding
   will follow conservatively
   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED,
   GIB)
   77M s/p colonoscopy a day ago who presents with BRBPR without changes
   in hemodynamics or HCT. At that procedure he underwent 7 polypectomies
   and was noted to have mild hemorrhoids. He has a history of easy
   bleeding, per the patient. He was admitted to the ICU for colonoscopy,
   but is refusing bowel prep for now and wants to see if his bleeding
   will stop spontaneously.
   .
   # LGIB: Likely due to recent polypectomies. S/P flex sig on [**1-7**],
   transfused multiple units and Hct relatively stable but after bump it
   seems to drift back down post-transfusion. Prepped with go-lytely o/n.
   Hct dropped again post-transfusion this AM.
   - colonoscopy later this morning
   - transfuse 3 units pRBC now
   - check post-transfusion Hct
   - check 5pm CBC, coags, calcium
   - add-on albumin to AM labs to correct Ca; give 4g IV calcium gluconate
   now
   - f/u GI recs and post-colonoscopy recs
   - Access with an 18g and 16g and 20g PIVs
   - Type and screen up to date
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt anxious on admission with SBP>170. Likely
   combination of stress plus chronic hypertension. Improved (albeit with
   concern could be BP heading in hypotensive direction sign).
   - Holding aggressive BP control in the context of bleeding
   - Will use hydralazine for SBP>170 with goal to maintain pressure
   around 140
   - Trend for now and treat as appropriate
   - Hold home lisinopril
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved. Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia from bowel
   prep; s/p NS infusion

   # Depression and anxiety: Continue home Prozac 20mg PO daily
   .
   # BPH: Continue home finasteride 5mg PO daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a colonoscopy a day ago and is now presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (melena) and hemodynamic instability. The bleeding is suspected to be lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) due to recent polypectomies. The patient has a history of easy bleeding and is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia (heart rate around 107 bpm) and hypertension (blood pressure around 132/54 mmHg). His respiratory rate is within normal range (14 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated (37.4°C or 99.3°F).

Laboratory results show an initial hemoglobin (Hct) level of 38.7%, which dropped to 31.0% after multiple transfusions. The white blood cell count is within normal range (8.0-11.3 K/uL), and platelet count is slightly low (298-329 K/uL). Renal function tests show normal values for creatinine (1.0 mg/dL) and blood glucose levels (104-116 mg/dL). Other lab results, including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after undergoing 7 polypectomies during a colonoscopy. The patient has a history of easy bleeding and was admitted to the ICU for colonoscopy. He is currently refusing bowel prep and wants to see if his bleeding will stop spontaneously.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate in the low 100s, blood pressure in the 140s, and good oxygen saturation on room air. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped initially but has been relatively stable after multiple transfusions. The patient continues to have melena (black, tarry stools), indicating ongoing bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased platelet count (Plt), and abnormal kidney function tests (Cr). The coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR) is also abnormal. Other lab values such as calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), phosphate (PO4), and glucose are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal stool filling of the ascending colon, air filling of multiple non-distended or slightly distended small bowel loops, and sparse small air-fluid levels.
