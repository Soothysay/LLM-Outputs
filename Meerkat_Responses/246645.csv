","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and renal vein thrombosis, currently managed on warfarin. She presents with left facial swelling and was found to have a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation. The patient is at risk for Ludwig's angina due to the rapid progression of infection and involvement of the submandibular and sublingual spaces. She has received antibiotics in the emergency department and a one-time dose of dexamethasone. There are currently no plans for surgical intervention, but the patient will be reassessed by the ENT team in the morning.

The patient has been started on vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam for gram-positive and anaerobic coverage, along with follow-up gland cultures. She has also been prescribed wedges and salivary massage to help stimulate secretions. The patient's head of bed is elevated at 30 degrees, and she is being monitored for increased salivation, dysphagia, or stridor. Fiberoptic airway assessment will be done for acute decompression, and the possibility of nasal fiberoptic airways or tracheostomy will be considered if needed. Humidified oxygen will be provided, and the patient will be kept NPO with aggressive IV hydration. Coumadin is being held, but heparin"

She has been diagnosed with left submandibular gland infection and a large salivary duct stone. The patient is at risk for Ludwig's angina due to the rapid progression of infection and involvement of the submandibular and sublingual spaces. She has received antibiotics in the emergency department and a single dose of dexamethasone. 

Current plans include continuing vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam for gram-negative and gram-positive coverage, as well as aerobic and anaerobic coverage. Salivary gland cultures will be followed up. 

The patient's head of bed will be elevated at 30 degrees, and fiberoptic airway assessment will be done for acute decompression. She will be monitored for increased salivation, dysphagia, or stridor. IV dex will be administered if there is evidence of airway compromise. 

Humidified oxygen will be provided, and the patient will be kept nil per os (NPO) with aggressive IV hydration. Coumadin will be held, but she will be started on a heparin bridge in case she goes to the operating room. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be used to reverse heparin if emergent surgery is planned. 

Follow-up with ENT recommendations is advised. IV morphine will be given for pain control.

   CONCLUSION:
   Extensive artifact from dental amalgam limits evaluation.
   1. Enlarged enhancing left submandibular gland with two calculi in the
   whartons duct and extensive surrounding inflammatory change in the
   subcutaneous tissues. The appearances are consistent with left
   submandibular
   sialadenitis secondary to obstructive sialoliths.
   2. Several borderline lymph nodes at all stations within the neck as
   described above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APA) who presented with left facial swelling. She was found to have a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation. The patient is at risk for Ludwig's angina due to the rapid progression of infection and involvement of the left submandibular space and sublingual space. She received antibiotics in the emergency department and a one-time dose of dexamethasone. There are no current plans for surgical intervention, but the ENT specialist will reassess in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ludwig's angina: The patient's rate of infection progression and involvement of the submandibular space and sublingual space put her at risk for Ludwig's angina, a serious infection that can spread to other areas, including the neck, chest, and head.
2. Airway compromise: Due to the potential for increased salivation, dysphagia, or stridor, there is a risk of airway compromise. Monitoring for these symptoms and having a plan in place for fiberoptic airway assessment or tracheostomy if needed is crucial.
3. Infection spread: The infection could spread to surrounding tissues and structures, leading to further complications such as cellulitis or abscess formation.
4. Renal involvement: The patient's history of renal vein throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and pulmonary embolism (PE). She presents with left facial swelling and was found to have a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation. The patient has been seen by ENT who recommended continuing IV antibiotics, QID wedges, and WID massages. There is a discrepancy regarding the removal of the stone, with the patient wanting it done as an inpatient and ENT preferring outpatient surgery. The patient experienced increased pain in the afternoon, and a fever of 101.6 degrees at 8pm. Cultures (blood and urine) were sent. The patient has a history of APS and renal vein thrombosis, managed on coumadin as an outpatient. The patient's medications include prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, lisinopril, prozac, PPI, and IV fluids. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin. She presents with left facial swelling and was found to have a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation. The patient has been seen by ENT without evidence of airway compromise. She received a one-time dose of dexamethasone in the emergency department. There are no current plans for surgical intervention while inpatient.

Medical Complications:
1. Left Facial Swelling: The patient has a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation, leading to left facial swelling. This can cause pain and potential complications if the infection spreads.
2. Acute Pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain due to the facial swelling and possibly other factors such as the underlying conditions or treatments.
3. Risk for Aspiration: The patient has dysphagia and an altered gag reflex, which puts her at risk for aspiration if her airway is compromised.
4. Inability to Protect Airway: The patient's inability to protect her airway increases the risk of aspiration and potential respiratory complications.
5. Gland Inflammation: The presence of gland inflammation may indicate an ongoing infection that needs to be addressed.
6. Renal Issues: The patient has a history of glomerulonephritis and is on immunosup"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin. She presented with left facial swelling and was found to have a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation. The patient has been experiencing dysphagia, airway compromise, acute pain, and is at risk for aspiration due to altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on aerosol-cool delivery device. Her blood cultures were obtained on 05/13/2121 at 09:28 PM and urine culture was obtained on 05/13/2121 at 10:00 PM. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 173 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, troponin T level of <0.01, glucose level of 122 mg/dL, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio ("
