   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo female with no known PMH who presents with six weeks of
   progressive anasarca, elevated bilirubin, and pancytopenia with
   hemolysis.
   .
   #. Anemia/pancytopenia:  Hemolysis appears to be a significant
   component of her anemia with very elevated LDH and low haptoglobin. No
   e/o DIC. Does not fit TTP/HUS (no fever, ARF, AMS).  Elevated retic
   count makes marrow infiltrative/suppressive process less likely. B12 is
   deficient, but also unlikely to be the only underlying cause given high
   retic count. Other inflammatory disorders such as lupus are in ddx.
   Hypothyroid with myxedema is also high on differential given TSH 17,
   but unclear if this explains all of picture.
   - endocrine consult
   - heme/onc consult
   - ordered peripheral smear
   - received 4U PRBCs, check post-transfusion Hct
   - transfuse to HCT > 21, diurese with 10mg IV Lasix
   - HIV, CMV, EBV VL, parvovirus
   - [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - coombs test
   - B12 replacement 1mg q day x 7 days, then 1mg q week x 4 weeks
   - consider IF antibody
   - consider rheumatology consult in AM
   .
   #. anasarca: renal function at baseline, only trace protenuria, midly
   low albumin, not highly consistent with nephrotic syndrome.  Possible
   high output right heart failure from prolonged anemia.  Underlying
   cardiomyopathy is also possible from inflammatory disorder or
   post-viral myocarditis.  Low voltage is also present on EKG.
   - diuresis with blood transfusions
   - ECHO
   .
   #. Pleural effusion: bilateral but R>L suggesting possible exudative
   process such as infection or malignancy, though could be transudative
   [**2-8**] anasarca or ascites.
   - cont diuresis
   - consider thoracentesis for culture, cytology, and therapeutic
   benefit.
   .
   #. Abd distension: likely from both anasarca and ascites.  Ascites
   concerning for peritoneal carcinomatosis (? ovary or uterine),
   cirrhosis (though liver does not appear cirrhotic by CT), vs related to
   overall volume overload. Would also be c/w inflammatory or endocrine
   process ie hypothyroidism.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with no known past medical history. She presents with progressive anasarca, elevated bilirubin, and pancytopenia with hemolysis. The patient's anemia/pancytopenia appears to be mainly due to hemolysis, as indicated by very high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and low haptoglobin. There are no signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The elevated reticulocyte count suggests a marrow infiltrative/suppressive process is less likely. The patient has a vitamin B12 deficiency, but it is unlikely to be the sole underlying cause given the high reticulocyte count. Other inflammatory disorders such as lupus are considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient also has hypothyroidism with myxedema, as indicated by a high TSH level, but it is unclear if this explains all of the picture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia/pancytopenia: The patient's condition could worsen if her hemolysis continues or if her bone marrow function does not improve. This could lead to further deterioration in her overall health and increase the risk of infection, bleeding, and other complications related to anemia and pancytopenia.

2. Hypothyroidism: If left untreated, the patient's hypothyroidism could lead to further complications such as myocardial dysfunction, decreased"

   57 yo female with no known PMH who presents with six weeks of
   progressive anasarca, elevated bilirubin, and pancytopenia with
   hemolysis.
   .
   #. Anemia/pancytopenia:  Hypothyroid with myxedema is also high on
   differential given TSH 17 and low T4. Hypothyroidism may explain
   anasarca and clinical symptoms (fatigue, constipation, dry skin,
   chills), but does not fully explain hemolytic anemia.  Most common
   cause of hypothyroidism would be Hashimoto
s. Pt also has B12
   deficiency which may explain her clinical picture in combination with
   hypothyroidism, since pernicious anemia is also an autoimmune disease
   that can be associated with hashimoto
s. In severe B12 deficiency,
   hemolytic picture can develop from increased stress on the marrow and
   ineffective hematopoeisis.
   Hemolysis appears to be a significant component of her anemia with very
   elevated LDH and low haptoglobin. No e/o DIC. Does not fit TTP/HUS (no
   fever, ARF, AMS).  Elevated retic count makes marrow
   infiltrative/suppressive process less likely. Rheum disorders such as
   lupus are in ddx but less likely to present in combination with
   hypothyroidism and B12 deficiency simultaneously.

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with no known past medical history who presents with progressive anasarca, elevated bilirubin, and pancytopenia with hemolysis. The patient also has a B12 deficiency and an elevated TSH level indicating hypothyroidism. The differential diagnosis includes hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency, and autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, and rheumatologic disorders like lupus.

The patient's anemia and pancytopenia could be explained by hypothyroidism, which may present with symptoms such as fatigue, constipation, dry skin, chills, and anasarca. However, the presence of hemolytic anemia, elevated LDH, and low haptoglobin suggests a significant component of hemolysis. The patient does not fit the criteria for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

The patient's renal function is at baseline with only trace proteinuria, mildly low albumin, and no highly consistent with nephrotic syndrome. However, the possibility of high output right heart failure from prolonged anemia or underlying cardiomyopathy is considered. An ECHO is recommended to further evaluate the cardiac function.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo female with no known PMH who presents with six weeks of
   progressive anasarca, elevated bilirubin, and pancytopenia with
   hemolysis.
   .
   #. Anemia/pancytopenia:  Likely due to severe B12 deficiency, likely
   [**2-8**] pernicious anemia, in setting of concomittant autoimmune
   hypothyroidism. Hemolysis picture is consistent with ineffective
   hematopoiesis. Coagulopathy does not fit completely with picture, but
   there is no evidence of DIC.  Pt is also being evaluated for PNH,
   thalasemia, although likely to be unreliable in setting of massive
   transfusion. Rheumatological process less likely with neg [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA.
   Viral process on top of other etiologies cannot be ruled out, and HIV,
   CMV, EBV, parvo VL still pending.

   TSH/T3/T4/fT4 in 3 days to ensure adequate absorption,a nd repeat in 4
   weeks to assess dosing requirements

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 57-year-old female with no known past medical history.
- She presents with progressive anasarca (generalized swelling), elevated bilirubin levels, and pancytopenia with hemolysis.
- The patient has been diagnosed with severe B12 deficiency, likely pernicious anemia, in the setting of concomitant autoimmune hypothyroidism.
- The hemolysis picture is consistent with ineffective hematopoiesis. Coagulopathy does not fit completely with the picture, but there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- The patient is also being evaluated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), thalassemia, although these are less likely in the setting of massive transfusion.
- Rheumatological processes are less likely with negative anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).
- Viral processes on top of other etiologies cannot be ruled out, and HIV, CMV, EBV viral loads (VL) are still pending.
- The patient is currently on levothyroxine (125 mcg) for hypothyroidism, and B12 supplementation is being continued.
- Folate and vitamin K supplementation are also ongoing.
- Iron supplementation has been withheld for now, but may be needed once B12 repletion improves cell production.

The patient is a 57-year-old female with no known past medical history who presents with progressive anasarca, elevated bilirubin, and pancytopenia with hemolysis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of anemia and heart failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/64 to 114/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is on various medications including furosemide and other ICU medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of fluid overload, such as edema in both lower extremities and no acute distress. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, and no signs of heart failure. The respiratory examination shows crackles on auscultation of the chest and scattered wheezes. The abdominal examination reveals a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The extremities show evidence of edema, but no cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination is within normal limits.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL and a low white blood cell count of 2.7 K/uL. The platelet count is slightly low at 93 K/uL. Other lab values, including electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, and liver function tests, are within normal range or show no significant abnormalities.

   57 yo female with no known PMH who presents with six weeks of
   progressive anasarca, elevated bilirubin, and pancytopenia with
   hemolysis.
   .
   #. Anemia/pancytopenia:  Likely due to severe B12 deficiency, likely
   [**2-8**] pernicious anemia, in setting of concomittant autoimmune
   hypothyroidism. Hemolysis picture is consistent with ineffective
   hematopoiesis. Coagulopathy does not fit completely with picture, but
   there is no evidence of DIC.  Pt is also being evaluated for PNH,
   thalasemia, although likely to be unreliable in setting of massive
   transfusion. Rheumatological process less likely with neg [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA.
   Viral process on top of other etiologies cannot be ruled out, and HIV,
   CMV, EBV, parvo VL still pending. Hct has been stable x 48 hours, so is
   not rapidly hemolyzing.

   #. anasarca: Most likely [**2-8**] hypothyroidism, since TTE did not suggest
   high output right heart failure from prolonged anemia.  Low voltage is
   present on EKG but no e/o pericardial effusion or myocarditis on TTE.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with no known past medical history who presents with progressive anasarca, elevated bilirubin, and pancytopenia with hemolysis. The patient has been diagnosed with severe B12 deficiency, likely pernicious anemia, and concomitant autoimmune hypothyroidism. Hemolysis is consistent with ineffective hematopoiesis, and coagulopathy does not fit completely with the picture. The patient is being evaluated for PNH, thalasemia, although likely to be unreliable in the setting of massive transfusion. Rheumatological process is less likely with negative [Doctor's Name], dsDNA. Viral process on top of other etiologies cannot be ruled out, and HIV, CMV, EBV, parvo VL are still pending. Hct has been stable for 48 hours, so the patient is not rapidly hemolyzing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia/Pancytopenia: The patient's anemia and pancytopenia are likely due to severe B12 deficiency, likely pernicious anemia, in the setting of concomitant autoimmune hypothyroidism. Hemolysis is consistent with ineffective hematopoiesis.
