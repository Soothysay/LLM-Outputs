   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2144-4-16**] 02:57 PM
   Overnight, started spironolactone and dose increased to 50 [**Hospital1 7**]
   BP variable, when awake and upset, BP wold rapidly rise to 180's, but
   mostly 160, required additional 50 IV hydral in addition to regular PO
   meds
   This AM, very tearful and upset. Via interpretor, pt is feeling
   ""unwell"". He feels sad that no one has visited him and overwhelmed by
   medical issues. Denies SI. he has tried to call him wife, but unable to
   get in touch. Also, he is very upset that he is urinating a lot and had
   urinary incontinence last night. No pain or discomfort. No headache,
   vision changes. Gave 1 mg Iv ativan at 8AM with dramatic improvement in

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of malignant hypertension, type A aortic dissection with emergent repair, type B dissection, and depression. The patient is currently admitted for further medical management of hypertension and hyperaldosteronism.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Malignant hypertension/hyperaldosteronism: This condition can lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias due to the increased workload on the heart. It can also cause renal complications like acute kidney injury due to reduced blood flow to the kidneys.

2. Type B dissection: The dissection flap extending into the left renal artery and probable areas of left renal infarct increase the risk of renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. There is also a risk of ongoing bleeding or rupture of the dissection flap.

3. Anemia: With a hematocrit (Hct) level of 30, the patient is anemic. This can lead to symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, and weakness. If severe, it may require transfusion or further investigation into the cause of anemia.

4. Depression: Untreated depression can lead to various complications, including an increased risk of suicide, poor adherence to medical treatment, and overall poor quality of life.

5. Renal infarct: The likely renal infarct in the setting of dissection increases the risk of chronic kidney disease"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of depression, poorly controlled hypertension, hyperaldosteronism, and type A and B aortic dissections. He was admitted for elective repair of type B dissection with a new graft and left renal artery stent. The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, reaching levels in the 200s systolic at home. He has been diagnosed with malignant hypertension and hyperaldosteronism, and there is concern about potential complications such as anemia and renal infarct due to the dissection flap extending into the left renal artery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, which can lead to end-organ damage if not managed appropriately.
2. Hyperaldosteronism: This condition can cause hypertension and hypokalemia, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is low, indicating a potential risk for anemia. Monitoring and appropriate management will be necessary.
4. Renal infarct: The dissection flap extending into the left renal artery may have caused a decrease in blood flow to the kidney, leading to the possibility of renal infarct. Regular monitoring of renal status is essential.
5. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently experiencing symptoms of sadness and feeling overwhelmed. It is important to provide psychosocial support and consider antidepressant medication"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of depression, poorly controlled hypertension, hyperaldosteronism, and type A dissection repair. He also has a history of type B aortic dissection compromising the left renal artery. The patient was admitted for elective repair of type B dissection (new graft) +/- left renal artery stent. Upon admission, he presented with uncontrolled hypertension and was treated with labetalol drip, oral labetalol, clonidine patch, lisinopril, hydralazine, and HCTZ-triamterene. Despite these interventions, his blood pressure remained high, often in the 200s systolic.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. He has shown labile blood pressure, which can fluctuate significantly. He also experiences increased blood pressure when feeling anxious. An IV dose of ativan was given, resulting in an improvement in blood pressure from 200 to 140 systolic.

The patient's vital signs have been monitored regularly, showing a sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 58 bpm, and an oxygen saturation of 94%. His weight is currently 117 kg, with a height of 71 inches.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of potassium (K+) at 5.1 mEq/L, as well as elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 30.1 mg/dL and creatinine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, type A aortic dissection, and subsequent emergent repair, as well as type B dissection. He is currently admitted for further medical management of hypertension and hyperaldosteronism. The patient has been diagnosed with primary hyperaldosteronism, as evidenced by elevated aldosterone levels, decreased plasma renin activity (PRA), and hypertension in the setting of hypokalemia. A CT abdomen revealed a stable lipoma but no adrenal adenoma. The patient's blood pressure responded to Ativan for anxiety and tearfulness but required an additional dose of IV hydralazine overnight. Low-dose Klonopin seems to be effective in managing anxiety. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant hypertension: The patient has a history of malignant hypertension, which can lead to serious complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage if not properly managed.
2. Hyperaldosteronism: This condition can cause high blood pressure, low potassium levels, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Type B aortic dissection: The presence of a dissection flap extending into the left renal artery and probable areas of left renal infarct indicates a potential risk for further complications related to the dissection, such as organ ischemia or rupture.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is low, indicating anemia. If severe, this can lead"

   # Type B dissection: with dissection flap extending into the left renal
   artery, and probable areas of left renal infarct.
   - goal SBP 140-160 (he reportedly gets hypotensive sx when SBP<120's
   per surgery service)
   - per vascular, they can tolerate SBP 160's
   # Anemia: Hct 30 today
   - if large drop, will contact vascular given risk of extravasation
   # L Renal infarct: Likely in setting of dissection
   - continue to monitor renal status
   # Depression: Currently denies SI but does endorse depressed mood. Very
   tearful this morning and feeling very overwhelmed. Klonipin somewhat
   helpful.
   - decreasing frequency of Klonipin
   - appreciate SW consult

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of depression, poorly controlled hypertension, hyperaldosteronism, type A dissection repair, and a compromised left renal artery. He was admitted for elective repair of a type B dissection with plans for a new graft and possible left renal artery stent. The patient presented with uncontrolled hypertension and was initially treated with labetalol drip, followed by oral labetalol and clonidine patch. He continues to have high blood pressure readings in the 200s with frequent headaches. Given his history of hyperaldosteronism, it was felt that the hypertension may be related to primary hyperaldosteronism. Since transfer, the patient has been on spirinolactone with IV hydralazine to keep his blood pressure within the range of 140-160 systolic.

The patient's allergies are unchanged from admission, and he has no known drug allergies. His last dose of antibiotics was on [**2144-4-17**] at 09:54 PM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, hydralazine, and other medications as needed. There have been no changes to the patient's medical and family history.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for the noted below. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 178/85 mmH"

He presented with uncontrolled hypertension and was admitted for elective repair of type B dissection, along with a possible left renal artery stent. In the hospital, his blood pressure remained high despite multiple medications.

The patient's current medications include labetalol, hydralazine, clonidine patch, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene, spironolactone, and heparin sodium. His allergies are negative for known drug allergies. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the chief complaint of uncontrolled hypertension. His physical examination shows a flat affect, 2/6 SEM ULSB (suggesting some form of heart murmur), decreased breath sounds at the right base, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no other significant findings.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's blood urea nitrogen and glucose levels are within normal range.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of depression, poorly controlled hypertension, hyperaldosteronism, and previous type A and B aortic dissection repairs. The patient was admitted for elective repair of type B dissection with the placement of a new graft and left renal artery stent. 

The patient's chief complaint is uncontrolled hypertension. He has been hypertensive since discharge from the hospital, with blood pressure frequently in the 200s. He also experiences frequent headaches. 

Due to the patient's history of hyperaldosteronism, it was felt that his hypertension may be related to primary hyperaldosteronism. The patient has been started on spironolactone, and his hydralazine drip has been discontinued. 

The patient's 24-hour events include an increase in spironolactone dosage from 25 to 50 mg and one IV dose of hydralazine yesterday morning. 

The patient's allergies are listed as no known drug allergies. 

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, hydralazine 75 q6, hctz, klonopin, ecasa, lisonpril, norvasc, pravachol, labetolol 800 tid, colace, aldactone 50 mg, risperdal 1 qhs, and clonazepam 0.5 tid. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the aforementioned issues. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 178/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient's physical examination revealed a flat affect, 2/6 SEM ULSB (severe mitral regurgitation), decreased breath sounds at the right base, soft and non-tender abdomen, no calf pain or swelling, and no rash or petechiae. 

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 439 K/uL, platelet count of 356, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 92 mg/dL, sodium level of 138 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride level of 101 mEq/L, and magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL. 

The patient's imaging studies show stable lipoma but no adrenal adenoma. 

The patient's assessment and plan include malignant hypertension/hyperaldosteronism, type B dissection with dissection flap extending into the left renal artery, anemia with a hematocrit level of 30%, likely left renal infarct, depression, and other conditions. 

The patient's care plan involves monitoring potassium levels, continuing 50 PO BID spironolactone, adding low-dose benzodiazepine (clonazepam 0.5 mg tid) to assist with blood pressure control, considering long-acting anti-anxiety medication such as SSRI if there is a response, weaning off oral agents if there is a response, reducing labetolol to 400 tid, discontinuing aline, and contacting vascular given risk of extravasation if there is a large drop in hematocrit. 

The patient's family is scheduled to visit today, and he may be stable for transfer to the floor if his blood pressure remains within the goal range of 140-160 over the course of the day."

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of depression, poorly controlled hypertension, hyperaldosteronism, and previous type A and type B aortic dissections. The patient was admitted for elective repair of the type B dissection (new graft) +/- left renal artery stent. He presented with uncontrolled hypertension and was initially managed with labetalol drip, labetalol PO, NGT drip, clonidine patch, lisinopril, hydralazine, and HCTZ-triamterene. Despite these interventions, the patient's blood pressure remained above 160 systolic. 

At home, the patient's blood pressure frequently reached 200s with frequent headaches. Due to his history of hyperaldosteronism, it was believed that the hypertension was related to primary hyperaldosteronism. Since transfer, the patient has been off the NGT and hydralazine drip. He was started on spironolactone with IV hydralazine to keep his blood pressure between 140-160.

The patient's medications include heparin sodium, hydralazine, hctz, klonopin, hydralazine 75 q6, ecasa, lisinopril, norvasc, pravachol, labetalol 800 tid, colace, aldactone 50 [**Hospital1**], risperdal 1 qhs, and clonazepam 0.5 tid.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the below-mentioned events. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1Â°C (98.7Â°F), Tcurrent 36.6Â°C (97.9Â°F), heart rate 67 bpm (55-71), blood pressure 178/85mmHg (112/49-195/88mmHg), respiratory rate 8 breaths per minute (0-32), and oxygen saturation 97%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 560 mL and total output of 1350 mL. The patient's labs include a white blood cell count of 10.2-10.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 10.7-32.9 g/dL, platelet count of 356-439 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 1.1-1.3 mg/dL, glucose of 81-92 mg/dL, sodium of 138-140 mEq/L, potassium of 3.8-4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 101-102 mEq/L, and magnesium of 1.1-1.3 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include malignant hypertension/hyperaldosteronism, type B dissection, anemia, left renal infarct, depression, and other conditions. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Malignant hypertension/hyperaldosteronism: This condition can lead to life-threatening complications such as heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and vision loss if not properly managed.

2. Type B dissection: If the dissection extends into vital organs like the renal artery, it can result in organ ischemia or infarction.

3. Anemia: Severe anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

4. Left renal infarct: This can lead to kidney dysfunction and potential loss of kidney function.

5. Depression: Untreated depression can lead to impaired daily functioning, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of suicide.

6. Infection: Prolonged use of indwelling lines and catheters increases the risk of bloodstream infections.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and surgery can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if dislodged.

8. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and stress can increase the risk of developing ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.

9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of developing pneumonia.

10. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's pre-existing conditions and medications may further compromise kidney function, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease."
