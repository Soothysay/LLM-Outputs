","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of COPD, recent pulmonary embolism, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted for shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, dyspnea, and acute renal failure. His vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an increased central venous pressure. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, increased serum creatinine, and abnormal chest X-ray findings. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to an infectious process or decompensated heart failure. Immediate management includes titrating dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and considering a trial of dobutamine with Vigileo to assess cardiac index. A cardiology consult is also recommended to assess for decompensated heart failure.
2. Dyspnea: The patient's difficulty breathing may be multifactorial, including fluid overload in the context of known systolic heart failure and baseline COPD. Management includes Lasix gtt at tolerated levels by BP, ipratropium/albuterol nebs as needed, weaning supplemental O2 to home requirement, and daily weight checks with free water restriction.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The elevated serum creatinine suggests pre"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old gentleman with a history of COPD, recent pulmonary embolism, and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted for symptoms of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU due to persistent hypotension and multi-lumen line placement. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. Physical examination reveals lethargy, bilateral rales, decreased breath sounds at the left base, muffled heart sounds, soft systolic murmur, and 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, elevated blood glucose, and altered electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be due to an infectious process or decompensated heart failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions such as dopamine infusion and fluid restriction should be implemented.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of bilateral rales, decreased breath sounds at the left base, and a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be initiated, and further investigations like sputum culture may be needed.
3. Decompensated Heart Failure: The patient's history of congestive heart failure (CHF"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3453**] is a 79 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD
   on 2-3L home O2, recent PE on coumadin s/p IVF filter placement, and
   recent NSTEMI medically managed admitted for 4-5 days of SOB,
   nonproductive cough, and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential diagnosis at this time includes
   decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock and less likely sepsis.
   Patient with known CHF with EF of 30% now with increased dry weight by
   10 lbs. Potential infectious sources include urosepsis versus
   pneumonia. Patient does have significant pyuria, but is unable to give
   clear urinary symptoms at home including dysuria or polyuria.  Patient
   with CXR in ED consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and
   increased retrocardiac opacity concerning for effusion versus
   pneumonia, although patient with recently treated CAP as outpatient
   with azithromycin.  Patient also has history of PE, but this is less
   likely to be new PE causing cor pulmonale given therapeutic INR and
   recent IVC filter placement.
   - Check mixed venous O2 sat
   - Continue dopamine, add dobutamine.
   - Lasix gtt with goal TBB -1000 liters today
   - Cardiology consult for recommendations regarding decompensated heart
   failure..
   - TTE today
   - Hold off on anti-hypertensives
   - Discontinue vancomycin, continue ceftriaxone.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including fluid overload in patient
   with known systolic heart failure, possibly secondary to ARF from lasix
   and baseline COPD although without signs of exacerbation including
   wheezes.
   - Lasix gtt/dobutamine/dopamine as above.
   - Ipratropium/albuterol nebs prn
   - Wean supplemental O2 to home requirement 2-3L
   - Daily weight check, free water restriction (1L)
   - Hold off on steroids for now.
   .
   # CAD: Recent NSTEMI that was medically managed.  ECG without evidence
   of acute ischemia and patient without chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # ARF: FeUrea 21.3%, suggesting that acute renal failure is due to
   pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion/forward
   flow from decompensated heart failure.  Baseline creatinine 1-1.2.
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # UTI: Continue ceftriaxone for 7 days ([**1-15**]),
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-40, now with hct of 26.4 with MCV 95 with
   unknown etiology to acute decrease.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Hemolysis labs
   - Recheck hct Q12H.  Would consider transfusing for hct<25 given recent
   NSTEMI, but this will be difficult given patient
s volume status.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with multiple PE in [**7-17**] currently on
   coumadin with mildly supratherapeutic INR.
   - Continue coumadin.
   .
   # EtOH abuse: Past history of EtOH use.
   - Continue thiamine, folate

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, recent pulmonary embolism (PE), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted for shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with moderate left ventricular dilatation, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and mild to moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation. He is also experiencing acute renal failure, anemia, and possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and reduced ejection fraction (EF) indicate decompensated heart failure. There is a need for aggressive diuresis, weaning off pressors, and further evaluation by cardiology.
2. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.0 and current creatinine of 2.1. Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.
3. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) of 30-40% has decreased to 27.9%. Further investigation into the cause of anemia is necessary, including checking hemolysis labs and stool for occult blood.
4. UTI: The patient is on ceftriaxone"

   Microbiology: Blood & Urine- P
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3453**] is a 79 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD
   on 2-3L home O2, recent PE on coumadin s/p IVF filter placement, and
   recent NSTEMI medically managed admitted for 4-5 days of SOB,
   nonproductive cough, and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: This most likely represents decompensated heart
   failure/cardiogenic shock and less likely sepsis.  Pt ECHO shows
   reduced EF (20-25%) and severe global hypokinesis.  BNP was >36,000.
   Cards was consulted and recommended diuresis and attempting to wean
   pressors.  Pt negative 400cc yesterday.  Potential infectious sources
   include urosepsis versus pneumonia.  Urine and blood cx pending.
   Patient with worsening CXR showing possible retrocardiac opacity
   concerning for effusion versus pneumonia, although patient with
   recently treated CAP as outpatient with azithromycin.  Patient also has
   history of PE, but this is less likely to be new PE causing cor
   pulmonale given therapeutic INR and recent IVC filter placement.
   - Cont gentle diuresis negative 1-2L as long as BP can tolerate.
   - Continue dobutamine and dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt with goal TBB -1000 liters today
   - f/u Cardiology consult for recommendations regarding decompensated
   heart failure..
   - Hold off on anti-hypertensives and restart BB & ACE when BP tolerate
   and off pressors
   - Change abx to vanco,zosyn, levofloxacin
   ..
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including fluid overload due to
   decompensated systolic heart failure (BNP >36,000), possibly secondary
   to ARF (Cr trending down from 2.1, baseline 1.0) and baseline COPD
   although without signs of exacerbation including wheezes.
   - Lasix gtt/dobutamine/dopamine as above.
   - Ipratropium/albuterol nebs prn
   - Wean supplemental O2 to home requirement 2-3L
   - Daily weight check, free water restriction (1L)
   - Hold off on steroids for now.
   .
   # CAD: Recent NSTEMI that was medically managed.  ECG without evidence
   of acute ischemia and patient without chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # ARF: FeUrea 21.3%, suggesting that acute renal failure is due to
   pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion/forward
   flow from decompensated heart failure.  Baseline creatinine 1-1.2.
   Improving today 2.1 despite lasix gtt
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins

   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-40, now with hct of 27.9 after 1U pRBC
   with unknown etiology to acute decrease.  Pt haptoglobin (230) and
   TBili mildly elevated.  LDH normal.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Recheck hct & hemolysis labs Q12H.  Would consider transfusing for
   hct<25 given recent NSTEMI, but this will be difficult given patient
   volume status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history significant for COPD, recent pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin after inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) medically managed. The patient was admitted for symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB), nonproductive cough, and hypotension.

24-hour events:
- Cardiac: Gentle diuresis with a goal of 1-2 liters, attempting to wean off pressors (dopamine and dobutamine), restarting metoprolol and lisinopril as blood pressure can tolerate, and continuing ASA/Plavix/simvastatin.
- Urine and blood cultures showed no growth.
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed severe global left ventricular (LV) hypokinesis with moderate LV dilatation, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, mild to moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation.
- Lasix infusion rate reduced due to low mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s; dobutamine and dopamine doses unchanged.
- Hemolysis labs showed normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated haptoglobin, and elevated bilirubin.

Arterial line started on 10/25/2181 at 7:00 PM.

Allergies:
- Bacitracin: Rash.

Last dose of antibiotics:
- Ceftriaxone on 10/25/2181 at 5:01 AM.
- Vancomycin on 10/25/2181 at 6:02 AM.

Infusions:
- Dopamine at 2 mcg/kg/min.
- Dobutamine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
- Furosemide (Lasix) at 2 mg/hour.

Other ICU medications:
- Continue ASA, Plavix, and statin.
- Hold off on anti-hypertensives.

Assessment and Plan:
- Hypotension: Most likely represents decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock and less likely sepsis. Patient echo shows reduced ejection fraction (20-25%) and severe global hypokinesis. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was >36,000. Cardiology recommended diuresis and attempting to wean off pressors. Patient negative 400cc yesterday. Potential infectious sources include urosepsis versus pneumonia. Urine and blood cultures pending.
- Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including fluid overload due to decompensated systolic heart failure (BNP >36,000), possibly secondary to acute renal failure (Cr trending down from 2.1, baseline 1.0) and baseline COPD although without signs of exacerbation including wheezes.
- CAD: Recent NSTEMI that was medically managed. ECG without evidence of acute ischemia and patient without chest pain.

- Dispo: ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and reduced ejection fraction indicate a likely decompensation of heart failure. This can lead to further hemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine suggest acute renal failure. If not managed appropriately, it can progress to chronic kidney disease and require renal replacement therapy.
3. Infection: The patient's recent hospitalization and medical interventions put him at an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
4. Hemolysis: The patient's elevated haptoglobin and bilir"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and valvular disease. He was admitted with hypotension and hypoxemia consistent with fluid overload. The patient has been managed by cardiology and has received diuretics and inotropic support. However, his condition has worsened, and he now presents with end-stage heart failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, and possible sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to COPD, possible pneumonia (PNA), and volume overload. He requires immediate attention for bronchospasm, and antibiotics should be administered. If necessary, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be required to manage his respiratory function.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be attributed to cardiogenic shock and possible septic shock. He should continue to receive dobutamine and dopamine to maintain adequate blood pressure. Cardiology should be consulted regarding the significance of the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) findings.

3. Infection: Despite negative cultures, the patient's chest X-ray suggests an infiltrate, and he has a urinary alkaline reaction (UAR) positive. It is important to await urine culture results and continue with appropriate antibiotic coverage, including vancomycin, zosyn, levofloxacin for urinary tract infection"

   Total time spent:  35 minutes
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure and valvular disease. He was admitted with hypotension and hypoxemia consistent with fluid overload. The patient's condition has not changed significantly since admission, except for worsening ejection fraction on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). His vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and heart rate. The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress, as indicated by tachypnea and diffuse wheezing. There is evidence of volume overload and possible pneumonia on a chest X-ray. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is critically ill and remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress, along with the presence of a chest X-ray suggesting pneumonia and volume overload, increases the risk of respiratory failure. Immediate interventions such as adding steroids for bronchospasm, increasing nebulizers, and considering non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to cardiogenic shock or possible septic shock. Continuing dobutamine and dopamine infusions, discussing the significance of the TTE results with cardiology, and further investigating the cause of hypotension (ischemic event or sepsis-induced) are important considerations.

","The patient is a 79-year-old man with a history of pulmonary embolism, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presents with 4-5 days of shortness of breath and nonproductive cough in the setting of fluid overload. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and he is currently unresponsive and unable to provide any history.

The patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO) after withdrawing all interventions and treatments except for those aimed at making the patient comfortable. The family is aware and in agreement with this decision.

Vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 66/39 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate of 103 bpm, and slightly elevated body temperature. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a non-rebreather mask and CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory distress.

Fluid balance reveals a negative balance of -1,289 mL since 12 AM, suggesting ongoing fluid losses. Blood products totaling 1,925 mL have been transfused, which may indicate ongoing bleeding or support for low blood counts.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, indicating possible infection or tissue hypoperfusion. Kidney function appears impaired with elevated creatinine levels. Liver enzymes are within normal range, but electrolyte levels are somewhat imbalanced.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old man with a history of pulmonary embolism, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He presented with 4-5 days of shortness of breath and nonproductive cough in the setting of fluid overload. The patient was made comfort measures only (CMO) yesterday, with all interventions and treatments aimed at making the patient comfortable. The family is aware and agrees with this decision. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can be a sign of shock or inadequate circulation to vital organs.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or worsening of respiratory status.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he is on non-rebreather oxygen with CPAP/PSV ventilation support. This suggests respiratory distress, possibly due to pneumonia or exacerbation of underlying COPD.
4. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT and PTT indicate a coagulopathy, which may be related to sepsis or the use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has low potassium, magnesium, and"
