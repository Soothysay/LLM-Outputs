","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed and a previous episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient has been diagnosed with acute blood loss anemia, likely due to a new ulcerated mass found during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient's Hct level has dropped from 36 to 27, and they received 2 units of blood, with a repeat Hct of 30 this morning. The patient continues to experience diarrhea and has gastric non-bleeding varices, as well as an ulcerated mass proximal to the antrum.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed and a previous episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). He has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed a blood clot in the stomach, gastric non-bleeding varices, and an ulcerated mass proximal to the antrum. The patient has a history of allergies to Zosyn and oxaliplatin. He has received infusions of midazolam and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 112/74 mmHg. His hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance within normal limits. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an oxygen saturation of 100%. He is alert and oriented, with no acute distress or signs of diaphoresis. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hematocrit level of 30.0%. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but his white blood cell count is low at 2.9 K/uL. The assessment and plan include ongoing supportive care, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, and consideration of oncology consultation due to the presence of a new ulcerated mass. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU with potential transfer to the floor later in the day."

","Summary:
The patient underwent an endoscopy at 09:03 AM, which was well-tolerated with stable vital signs. They received fentanyl, versed, and normal saline during the procedure. The patient remains comfortable, free of distress, and with stable vital signs. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is planned to investigate a probable metastasis in the stomach related to colon cancer. The patient has a history of allergies to Zosyn and Oxaliplatin. They are currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent events. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and peripheral vascular examination are all within normal limits. The lab results show normal levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metastatic spread of colon cancer: Given the patient's history of colon cancer and the presence of a probable metastasis in the stomach, there is a potential for further spread of the disease to other organs.
2. Allergic reactions: The patient has a history of allergies to Zosyn and Oxaliplatin. There is a risk of allergic reactions if they are exposed to these medications or similar substances in the future.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of metastatic colon cancer who underwent left hemicolectomy and chemotherapy, presenting with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. He underwent an endoscopy which showed a large ulcerated mass lesion in the stomach, but no active bleeding was observed. The patient is hemodynamically stable but has a decreased hematocrit level. He is being treated with packed red blood cell transfusion, proton pump inhibitor, and will undergo an elective endoscopy in the morning. The patient also has a history of tachycardia, which is currently well controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has already experienced an upper GI bleed, and there is a potential risk of recurrence due to the presence of a mass lesion in the stomach. This could lead to further blood loss and require immediate intervention.

2. Anemia: The patient's decreased hematocrit level indicates acute blood loss anemia. If the bleeding continues or additional blood loss occurs, it can lead to severe anemia and compromise tissue oxygenation.

3. Infection: The patient has a history of allergies to certain antibiotics, including Zosyn and Oxaliplatin. Therefore, caution should be exercised while selecting appropriate antibiotics for any potential infections.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of tachycardia, specifically narrow complex tachycardia with regular rhythm, possibly due to AVRT or AVN"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer who was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and acute blood loss anemia. He underwent an endoscopy that revealed an ulcerated mass in the stomach. The patient continues to experience melena and has required additional blood transfusions. 

During the night, the patient experienced a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) episode, which responded to carotid massage. His allergies include Zosyn and Oxaliplatin. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/61 mmHg to 109/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished but diaphoretic. His cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or irregularities detected. His respiratory system is clear, with symmetric chest expansion and no crackles or wheezes. 

The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. There is no distention or clubbing noted. His extremities are warm and well-perfused, with no cyanosis or edema. 

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, leukocyte count of 135"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer admitted to the ICU for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and acute blood loss anemia. He experienced a sudden ventricular tachycardia (SVT) that responded to carotid massage. The patient has a history of allergies to Zosyn and oxaliplatin. He required additional units of blood transfusion due to ongoing melena and a drop in hemoglobin levels. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, normal heart rate, and respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance within normal limits. The patient is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient who appears diaphoretic. His eyes are clear, and his cardiovascular system is normal with no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. Respiratory system examination shows clear breath sounds without any crackles, wheezes, or bronchial breath sounds. Abdominal examination is unremarkable with soft, non-tender bowel sounds. Extremities are warm and without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

","The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer who underwent a left hemicolectomy and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. He is currently in the ICU due to acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has received a total of three units of blood transfusion since admission and is hemodynamically stable. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has fluctuated throughout the day but remains within a relatively stable range.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/72 mmHg to 111/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently not on respiratory support.

Laboratory results show a low white blood cell count (WBC) of 2.9 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and normal liver function tests (ALT/AST: 23/24). Imaging studies reveal an increase in the size of the pancreatic mass and other metastatic lesions, as well as chronic occlusion of the splenic vein/artery and superior mesenteric vein with extensive varices.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute blood loss anemia secondary to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, tachycardia (narrow complex tachy regular), leukopenia with an ANC of 840, and cold so"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of metastatic colon cancer who presented with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been treated with transfusion and is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient has a known pancreatic mass that may be encroaching on the stomach. Other medical conditions include tachycardia, which is currently well controlled, and cold sores likely due to HSV mucositis. The patient's colon cancer is being managed by the oncology service.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss, leading to a drop in hemoglobin levels. This can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
2. Pancreatic mass complications: The pancreatic mass may cause further bleeding or obstruction, leading to complications such as pancreatitis or intestinal ischemia.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which can be a response to blood loss or an independent arrhythmia. If uncontrolled, it can lead to decreased cardiac output and organ perfusion.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy and invasive procedures.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and malignancy increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if dislodged.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of metastatic colon cancer who underwent a left hemicolectomy and chemotherapy. He presented with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been transfused with three units of blood since admission and is hemodynamically stable. He still has maroon stools.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 101/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on mechanical ventilation but does not require supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.0%, platelet count of 141 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 94 mg/dL, and an international normalized ratio of 1.1. Imaging shows an enlarged pancreatic mass and enlarged lymph nodes.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute blood loss anemia secondary to upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a large ulcerated mass at the angularis and gastric varices. No visible source for intervention. The patient is hemodynamically stable despite a notable drop in hematocrit. He is still experiencing maroon stools. The plan is to monitor his hemodynamic status, continue transfusions if"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of metastatic colon cancer, admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and a gastric mass. The patient has experienced transient supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and acute blood loss anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 99/67 to 111/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds.

Lab results show a low white blood cell count (WBC) of 2.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.8 g/dL, normal platelet count (Plt) of 141,000, and normal liver function tests. Imaging shows an increased pancreatic mass, increased retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV)/varices, and lung lesions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleed: The patient initially presented with a GI bleed, which appears to be decreasing. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to prevent re-bleeding or worsening of the condition.

2. Acute Blood Loss"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer who was admitted to the ICU for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and a gastric mass. The patient's condition has been relatively stable, with no need for blood transfusion over the past 24 hours. The bleeding appears to be decreasing, and the plan is to continue pantoprazole (Protonix) orally for GI protection and proceed with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) tomorrow. The patient also experienced a transient supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), but there have been no further recurrences. The cause of leukopenia is unclear, possibly related to medication. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient initially presented with a significant upper GI bleed, which could lead to continued bleeding, anemia, and hypotension.
2. Colon cancer with metastasis: The presence of metastatic colon cancer increases the risk of further spread to other organs and potential complications such as liver dysfunction or lung embolism.
3. Transient SVT: Although the SVT resolved, there is a potential risk for recurrent arrhythmias or progression to more serious cardiac events.
4. Leukopenia: The low white blood cell count may increase the risk of infections and could be due to medication or an underlying condition.
5. Pancreatic mass: The increased pancreatic mass seen on imaging suggests possible progression of the disease and"
