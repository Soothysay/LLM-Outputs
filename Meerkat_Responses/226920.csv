","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. The 24-hour events, allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications are also not provided. Changes to medical and family history are not documented. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for any noted below.

The flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings. However, specific values and details are not given. Labs, radiology results, WBC count, Hct, Plt, Cr, Troponin T, TCO2, Glucose, ECG, and imaging results are mentioned but not specified.

The assessment and plan section includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, VAP, communication, comments, code status, and disposition. Again, specific details are not provided.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the limited information provided in the progress note, it is challenging to determine specific potential medical complications. Additional details about the patient's condition, test results, and treatments would be necessary to identify potential complications accurately."

   Changes to medical and family history:
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85F with a PMH s/f dementia, atrial fibrillation, and
   chronic UTIS with resistant organisms.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1**]
   on [**2191-11-18**] after an unwitnessed fall at [**Hospital **] Rehab.  Her fall was
   complicated by bilateral humeral fractures and a nasal fracture.  She
   went to the OR on [**2191-11-19**] for bilateral ORIF of both fractures and was
   transfused 3 units pRBCs.  She was transferred to TSICU on [**11-22**] for
   further management of afib with RVR.  In the TSICU the team consulted
   cardiology, who recommended diltiazem 30mg TID with a diltiazem drip-
   to be weaned as tolerated.  She tolerated this well on [**11-23**], and was
   weaned off of the drip.  She was also given two doses of 10mg IV
   furosemide on this day for pulmonary edema (in addition to her home
   dose of 80mg daily), with urine outputs as high as 300cc/hr (-700cc
   today).  Today, the team had more difficulty with her rate control and
   added metoprolol 50mg TID to her diltiazem, and she recieved a total of
   three doses of 5mg IV metoprolol for heart rates in the 160s.
   .
   Of note, on admission the patient had positive urine cultures with an
   ESBL.  Meropenem was started given her history of prior history of
   resistant organisms.  Her cultures confirmed sensitivity to this.  The
   medication was stopped on [**11-21**] given negative urine cultures x 72
   hours.  Since discontinuing the meropenam, the patient's WBC count has
   risen from 6--> 18 with 90% neutrophils and 3% bands.  She is also
   having increasing diarrhea.

   Assessment and Plan
   Worsening aflutter likely from increased adrenergic tone from infection
   (sources include lung, urine, and possibly stool), post op stress, and
   recent diuresis.  Things overall got worse on [**11-22**] when [**Last Name (un) **] was
   stopped, and diuresis started.  Need to treat infections, and manage
   fluid status carefully.
   # Afib/Aflutter:  Likely triggered by diuresis, systemic infection and
   increased adrenergic tone.
   - load dilt and restart gtt
   - d/c metoprolol
   - seems euvolemic v so continue to monitor I/O's for now, would be
   hesistant to give more fluid given tachypnea
   - cards following, may need to be d/c'd with KOH monitor
   - no anticoagulation given fall risk
   .
   # Pulm edema/Chronic left pleural effusion: Pt tachypnea with small O2
   requirement
   - Eval CVP for respiratory variation- if + variation, hold further
   lasix, if no variation, would bolus 10mg IV x1 (responds well to this)
   - Continue meropenem, hold flagyl until stools confirmed C difficile.
   - F/u urine, blood, stool for c. diff
   .
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure - On standing lasix at baseline
   but appears clinically dry right now
   - hold lasix for now
   .
   # Nasal fracture - seen by plastics who recommended dressing changes
   and surgical correction concurrent with humerus fix, however,
   risks/benefits or reduction of nose discussed with family who opt for
   non-operative management due to risk of complications
   - xeroform and DSD to forehead daily x1 week, then bacitracin [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # UTI - Continue meropenem
   - f/u culture data
   - ID following
   .
   # Diarrhea - Pt recently on [**Last Name (un) **] and has been in NH and hospital
   - f/u stool cultures
   .
   #. Osteoporosis - Calcium and Vitamin D
   .
   #. Temporal Arteritis/Polymyalgia Rheumatica  - Continue prednisone
   .
   #. Depression w/ catatonia and confusion assoc w/ dementia - Continue

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and chronic urinary tract infection (UTI) with resistant organisms. She was admitted to the hospital after a fall and subsequent bilateral humeral fractures and nasal fracture. She underwent surgery for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of both fractures and received a transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). She was then transferred to the tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) for further management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). In the ICU, the patient tolerated weaning off the diltiazem drip and received two doses of intravenous furosemide for pulmonary edema. Her urine output has been high, with a maximum of 300cc/hr today. The patient's white blood cell count has risen from 6 to 18 with 90% neutrophils and 3% bands, indicating a possible infection. She is also experiencing increasing diarrhea. Her vital signs are stable, but she is tachypneic and requires supplemental oxygen. Her blood cultures were initially negative but turned positive for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The patient's imaging shows no significant changes, with a slight decrease in the right pleural effusion. The microbiology report indicates sensitivity to meropenem. The patient's assessment and plan involve treating infections, managing fluid status"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with dementia, atrial fibrillation, and chronic multi-drug resistant urinary tract infection (UTI) who presents with bilateral humeral fractures and a nasal fracture after a fall. The patient has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for rapid atrial fibrillation/flutter and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient's medical history includes osteoporosis, temporal arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica, depression with catatonia and confusion associated with dementia, vitamin D deficiency, and chronic pain. The patient is currently on multiple medications including prednisone, seroquel, cymbalta, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium, and pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's urine culture shows resistance to various antibiotics. The patient's imaging reveals persistent large left-sided effusion, moderate right-sided effusion, and cardiomegaly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent rapid atrial fibrillation/flutter may increase the risk of cardiac complications such as stroke, heart failure exacerbation, or arrhythmias.
2. Infection: The patient has a chronic multi-drug resistant UTI and recent yeast infection in the urine. There is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and chronic urinary tract infection (UTI) with resistant organisms. She was admitted to the ICU after falling and sustaining bilateral humeral fractures and a nasal fracture. Her current conditions include worsening atrial fibrillation (afib) likely due to increased adrenergic tone from infection and post-operative stress, pulmonary edema with chronic left pleural effusion, diastolic congestive heart failure, nasal fracture, yeast UTI, Clostridium difficile infection, osteoporosis, temporal arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica, depression with catatonia and confusion associated with dementia, vitamin D deficiency, and chronic pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening atrial fibrillation: The patient's afib may continue to worsen and lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of tachypnea and small O2 requirement indicate possible pulmonary edema. If not managed properly, it can lead to respiratory distress and failure.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's low urine output despite large pleural effusions and stable blood pressure suggest diastolic congestive heart failure. If not treated, it can progress to cardiac dysfunction and complications.
4. Nasal fracture complications: The patient has a nasal fracture that may lead to breathing difficulties or deformities"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of dementia, amyloid angiopathy, CVA, atrial fibrillation, chronic UTIs, diastolic CHF, temporal arteritis, depression, vitamin D deficiency, and other issues. She was admitted to the ICU after an unwitnessed fall and bilateral ORIF surgery. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress with diffuse expiratory wheezes, overt volume overload on chest X-ray, and positive for Clostridium difficile infection. She is also showing signs of delirium and confusion, along with atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PULMONARY EDEMA: The patient's respiratory distress and volume overload indicate a potential complication of pulmonary edema. Immediate measures need to be taken to decrease fluid intake and manage respiratory symptoms.
2. C. DIFFICILE INFECTION: The patient's positive test for Clostridium difficile infection suggests a potential complication of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Treatment should be initiated promptly to prevent further complications.
3. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current symptoms indicate a potential complication of irregular heart rhythm. Cardiac monitoring and management are necessary to control heart rate and prevent associated complications.
4. DELIRIUM/CONFUSION: The patient's baseline dementia and current disorientation suggest a potential complication of delirium or worsening confusion. Close monitoring and appropriate management of"

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and chronic multi-drug resistant urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented after a fall with bilateral humeral fractures and a nasal fracture. She was admitted to the MICU for rapid atrial fibrillation with flutter and volume overload on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current medications include diltiazem uptitrated to 90 mg QID for rate control in atrial fibrillation, heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix) for CHF, and various other medications for her chronic conditions including osteoporosis, temporal arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica, depression with catatonia and confusion associated with dementia, vitamin D deficiency, and chronic pain.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 89 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 115/49 to 132/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula, and a CVP of 9 mmHg. Her weight is currently 78.3 kg, which is an increase from her admission weight of 73.2 kg.

","The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of dementia, amyloid angiopathy, CVA, atrial fibrillation, chronic UTIs, diastolic CHF, temporal arteritis, chronic prednisone use, depression with a history of catatonia, vitamin D deficiency, and other issues. She was admitted to the trauma unit after an unwitnessed fall at a rehabilitation center, where she lives. She had undergone bilateral ORIF on [**11-19**] and is now experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 124/55 mmHg (95/40-132/110 mmHg), respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula, and current CVP of 9 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 15.0 to 20.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level ranging from 27.5% to 30.0 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 359 to 540 K/uL, creatinine level ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 mg/dL, glucose level ranging from 110 to 205 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.02 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment and plan include urinary tract infection (UTI), dementia, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), leukocytosis, pulmonary edema, pain control, atrial fibrillation, delirium/confusion, and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's UTI, development of new infections due to immunosuppression from chronic prednisone use, exacerbation of heart failure symptoms, increased risk of falls due to delirium/confusion, and potential complications related to atrial fibrillation such as stroke or heart rhythm abnormalities."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of dementia, amyloid angiopathy, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 50%, temporal arteritis, chronic prednisone use, depression with a history of catatonia, vitamin D deficiency, and other medical issues. She was admitted to the trauma unit for bilateral orthopedic fixation and developed AFib with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has shown improvement in respiratory distress after diuretic therapy. It is recommended to continue diuretic therapy and aim for an additional 500 cc negative fluid balance today. Additional Lasix may be given as needed for rate control.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has tested positive for C. diff. It is advised to continue Flagyl IV for now and plan a two-week course. Discontinue Flagyl completely after bowel movement (BM) x 24 hours and monitor for any signs of worsening or KUB dilation.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has baseline dementia and is easily redirected. Orientation appears better when with her daughter. Continue home medications including Remeron and Seroquel.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of dementia, amyloid angiopathy, CVA, atrial fibrillation, chronic UTIs, diastolic CHF, temporal arteritis, depression, and vitamin D deficiency. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing an unwitnessed fall at her rehabilitation facility. She has undergone bilateral ORIF on 11/19 and is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient is showing improvement in respiratory distress after diuresis. Further attempts to remove fluid will be made today.
2. Clostridium difficile Infection (C. diff): The patient tested positive for C. diff. Treatment with Flagyl IV will continue for the time being, followed by a two-week course. Stool culture will be checked for any dilations.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's baseline dementia makes her prone to confusion. Orientation seems better with the presence of her daughter. Current medications for delirium will be continued.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): Cardiology is monitoring the patient's AFib, and the dose of Diltia has been increased. The patient is currently adequately controlled, but there was a brief episode of AFib with aberrancy last night.
5. Pain Control: Non-narcotics such as Tylenol will be used for pain management."
