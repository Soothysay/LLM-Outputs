","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of recurrent metastatic uterine cancer.
- She was admitted with pericardial effusion and tamponade, which required a pericardial window and drain placement.
- A total of 500 cc of bloody fluid was removed.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- She is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and morphine sulfate.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 37.9 C (100.2 F), heart rate in the 150s with atrial flutter, blood pressure ranging from 119/49 to 129/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention up to the angle of the jaw, a point of maximal impulse located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, and no murmurs or gallops.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, decreased sodium, and normal other electrolyte levels.
- The patient has a history of recurrent metastatic uterine cancer, pericardial effusion, and tamponade.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: Given the patient's history of pericardial effusion and tamponade, there is a risk of recurrent cardiac tamponade if the effusion reaccumulates.
2. Malignant Pleural Effusion: The patient's history of recurrent metastatic uterine cancer increases the risk of developing malignant pleural effusion, which can compromise respiratory function.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium level could be due to SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) associated with malignancy, and if not addressed, it may lead to further electrolyte imbalances and neurological complications.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and cancer increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent clot formation.
5. Infection: Due to the invasive procedures and hospital stay, the patient is at risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
6. Uremia: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration in renal function.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is often on the lower side, indicating a risk of hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
8. Pulmonary Edema: Given the patient's cardiac status and potential fluid overload, there is a risk of developing"

She is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, morphine sulfate for pain control, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate in the 150s, blood pressure ranging from 119/49 to 129/69 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-33 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is oriented x3 with appropriate mood and affect.

Physical examination findings include a well-nourished female with no jugular venous distention, supple neck, and no peripheral edema. Cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line with regular heart sounds and no murmurs, lifts, or thrills. Lung examination reveals clear lung fields without any wheezes or crackles. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of recurrent metastatic uterine cancer. She was admitted with pericardial effusion and tamponade, and underwent pericardial drain placement. The patient also has a pleural effusion, which is exudative in nature. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 89-104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/49-129/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals jugular venous distention up to the angle of the jaw, a point of maximal impulse located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, and normal S1, S2 heart sounds without murmurs, gallops, or lifts. There are no chest wall deformities or scoliosis. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21200/uL, elevated hemoglobin at 10.5 g/dL, elevated potassium at 5.7 mg/dL, and decreased sodium at 126 mEq/L. The ECG shows atrial flutter, and the echocardiogram shows minimal pericardial fluid with preserved left ventricular systolic function.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of recurrent metastatic uterine cancer.
- She was admitted with pericardial effusion and tamponade, which required a pericardial drain.
- The patient also has a pleural effusion on the right side, which is exudative in nature.
- Her current vital signs show a heart rate in the 150s, likely due to hypovolemia. She has been treated with metoprolol and intravenous fluids.
- The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated glucose levels, and abnormal coagulation profile.
- An echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricular systolic function but did not rule out a focal wall motion abnormality due to suboptimal image quality.
- The patient's general appearance is within normal limits, with no signs of pallor or cyanosis. Her neck is supple, but jugular venous distention is present up to the angle of the jaw.
- The patient's lungs are clear without any abnormal breath sounds. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal bruits.
- Her extremities have good pulses and no edema. There are no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas on her skin.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, with slightly"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of recurrent metastatic uterine cancer admitted to the ICU with pericardial effusion and tamponade. The patient underwent a pericardial drain and had 800cc of fluid removed, which is consistent with an exudative effusion, most likely malignant in nature. The patient also has a pleural effusion on the left side, which is exudative in nature. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, with a heart rate of 104 bpm and low blood pressure of 110/59 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 91%. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and potassium. The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range. The patient is currently on metoprolol for tachycardia and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's physical examination reveals jugular venous distention up to the angle of the jaw, diminished breath sounds to the mid-lung on the left, and no peripheral edema. The patient's abdominal examination is unremarkable.

The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 75.6 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1280 mL, with 780 mL given by PO, 500 mL through IVF, and 800 mL drained from drains. Total output is 2100 mL, consisting of 500 mL blood products and 1300 mL urine output. The patient's respiratory support includes O2 delivery device none,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of recurrent metastatic uterine cancer, admitted to the ICU with pericardial effusion and tamponade. She underwent pericardial drain placement and had 800cc of serosanguineous fluid removed, which was sent for analysis. The fluid is consistent with an exudative effusion, most likely malignant given her cancer history. The patient's pain is being managed with NSAIDs, and the pericardial drain will be pulled today. Fluid cytology and culture will be followed up.

The patient also has a tachycardia, likely atrial flutter, possibly precipitated by hypovolemia. This improved with metoprolol and intravenous fluids. She will be monitored on telemetry once the pericardial drain is pulled.

Additionally, the patient has a pleural effusion on the right side, which is exudative in nature. Thoracentesis will be performed today, and cytology and culture will be followed up.

Her uterine cancer is being managed with palliative chemotherapy. Her left ventricular ejection fraction is normal (55%) with minimal effusion, and there is no history of coronary artery disease.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutritional needs, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"
