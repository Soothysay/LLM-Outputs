","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and recent discharge from hospice. The patient presents with hematemesis and has been admitted to the ICU.

24-hour events:
- The patient has been increasingly hypotensive overnight, with a persistent systolic blood pressure in the 40s.
- The patient appears comfortable, well sedated, and shows no signs of acute distress.
- The family has been notified of the patient's persistent hypotension.
- The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation.
- Pantoprazole (Protonix) was administered at 12:19 AM.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 42/31 to 83/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation, with a total fluid input of 6,113 mL and output of 2,210 mL.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
- Blood gas analysis and other laboratory results are pending.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and renal insufficiency.

Assessment and Plan:
- The patient is comfortable and sedated.
- Goals of care include minimal escalation of care and no aggressive measures.
- The patient is DNR/DNI.
- Family is aware of the patient's critical condition.
- Plan includes continuing fentanyl and midazolam infusions titrated to patient comfort and sedation.
- Mechanical ventilation will be continued for now, with the possibility of discussing extubation with the family in the morning.
- The patient has significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to esophagitis, gastritis, or peptic ulcer disease.
- No plans for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) due to overall goals of care.
- Protonix 40 mg IV BID is being administered, and the patient is NPO (nothing by mouth).
- Positive urine analysis indicates oliguria with multiple prior positive cultures for Klebsiella and colonization.
- Antibiotic treatment is being withheld as the patient is likely colonized with Klebsiella.
- The patient has severe diastolic dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation, with recent admission and aggressive diuresis.
- No diuretics are being given due to hypotension.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is not anticoagulated based on goals"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.
- She presented with hematemesis and was recently discharged from the hospital with hospice care.
- The patient's current condition includes severe diastolic dysfunction, TR (tricuspid regurgitation), oliguria (low urine output), and positive blood cultures for Klebsiella.
- She is on mechanical ventilation and sedation with fentanyl and midazolam infusions.
- Her vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 42/31 mmHg, and her heart rate is 84 bpm.
- The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed, with significant upper GI bleeding and a drop in hematocrit from 25 to 24.2%.
- She has chronic renal insufficiency, with worsening renal function during her last admission.
- The patient's goals of care are minimal escalation of care and comfort, with no aggressive measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially cause organ damage.

2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a significant upper gastrointestinal bleed, which can result in further blood loss and potential shock if not managed properly.

3. Renal insufficiency: The"
