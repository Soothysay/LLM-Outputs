","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyperglycemia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Upon admission, the patient's blood glucose levels were elevated, and they were started on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and their blood glucose levels have been trending downward.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Hypoglycemia: Due to the administration of insulin, there is a risk of hypoglycemia, which can lead to symptoms such as confusion, dizziness, sweating, and even loss of consciousness if not promptly addressed.
2. Infection: Patients with DKA are at an increased risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin should be continued to minimize these risks.
3. Cardiac complications: Elevated cardiac enzymes suggest potential cardiac involvement. Further evaluation may be required to determine the extent of cardiac damage and to guide appropriate management.
4. Nephropathy: Diabetic patients with DKA are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed appropriately.
5. Neuropathy: Prolonged hyperglycemia can lead to"

   Assessment: This is a 55 yo man with DM type 2, insulin dependent ,
   hepatitis C  who presented overnight w/ sx of weakness and polyuria,
   found to have BG >1000, anion gap acidosis, leukocytosis and acute
   renal failure.

   Plan:
   # Diabetic ketoacidosis: CXR clear and U/A without sign of infection.
   However, WBC
s continue to rise. No chest pain to suggestive cardiac
   etiology, EKG without ischemic changes but CE trending up likely [**2-20**]
   tachycardia/ incr demand.
   - Metabolic acidosis/Dehydration: Anion gap 27 on admission. + ketones
   in urine. Venous pH 7.33. Also w/ significant component of dehydration.
   Now, AG resolved to 11.
   - Transition insulin gtt to Lantus at 19 (half dose) plus RISS
   - IVF- cont NS at 200/hr for now
   -Start diabetic regular diet this am
   - rpt labs with CE at 11am- pt is v difficult stick
   - q1hr fingersticks
   - blood, urine cx pending

   # Elevated [**Name (NI) 3146**] Pt with 0.06 trop on admission. Trop now risen to 0.11
   with no EKG changes and pt asymptomatic, likely [**2-20**] tachycardia
   -Rechk CE with lytes and CBC at 11am
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine 2.0 on admission now down to 1.3
   after aggressive hydration (baseline from [**2131**] appears to be 0.8).
   Most likely prerenal secondary to volume depletion, however keep AIN in
   ddx given recent NSAID use.
   - check urine lytes, urine eos
   - IVFs as above
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 123 on admission, now normalized to 136. Most likely
   secondary to volume depletion as improved with IVF.
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 3147**] Pt with WBC continuing to incr to 19.8 this am with no
   signs of symptoms of infection. Afebrile. Will continue to monitor

   # Diabetes mellitus Type II: Followed at [**Last Name (un) 303**]. Overall sounds like pt
   having difficulty with qid fingersticks and insulin administration. It
   may make sense to switch to [**Hospital1 **] regimen of combined short and long
   acting insulin.
   - Will need to arrange close f/u appt.
   - Cont. secondary prevention w/ statin, aspirin. ACE-inhibitor being
   considered as an outpt.
   - Pneumovax and flu shot
 no record of pt having received either. TDAP
   given [**2140-10-19**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hepatitis C, and insulin-dependent diabetes. He presented with symptoms of weakness and polyuria and was found to have a blood glucose level exceeding 1000 mg/dL, anion gap acidosis, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has an elevated cardiac enzyme level, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and signs of acute renal failure. The plan includes transitioning from regular insulin to Lantus at a half dose plus RISS, continuing intravenous fluids, starting a regular diabetic diet, and repeating labs with cardiac enzymes at 11 am.

2. Metabolic acidosis/dehydration: The patient initially had an anion gap of 27 on admission, which has now resolved to 11. The plan includes aggressive hydration and monitoring for any signs of infection.

3. Elevated cardiac enzymes: Although the EKG shows no ischemic changes, the cardiac enzyme levels are trending up, indicating a potential cardiac etiology. The plan includes rechecking cardiac enzymes with electrolytes and CBC at 11 am.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved from 2.0 on admission to 1.3 after aggressive hydration. The most likely cause is pr"

   Assessment: This is a 55 yo man with DM type 2, insulin dependent ,
   hepatitis C  who presented overnight w/ sx of weakness and polyuria,
   found to have BG >1000, anion gap acidosis, leukocytosis and acute
   renal failure.
   .
   Plan:
   # Diabetic ketoacidosis: CXR clear and U/A without sign of infection.
   However, WBC
s continue to rise. No chest pain to suggestive cardiac
   etiology, EKG without ischemic changes but CE trending up likely [**2-20**]
   tachycardia/ incr demand.
   - Metabolic acidosis/Dehydration: Anion gap 27 on admission. + ketones
   in urine. Venous pH 7.33. Also w/ significant component of dehydration.
   Now, AG resolved to 11.
   - Transition insulin gtt to Lantus at 19 (half dose) plus RISS
   - IVF- cont NS at 200/hr for now
   -Start diabetic regular diet this am
   - rpt labs with CE at 11am- pt is v difficult stick
   - q1hr fingersticks
   - blood, urine cx pending
   .
   # Elevated [**Name (NI) 3146**] Pt with 0.06 trop on admission. Trop now risen to 0.11
   with no EKG changes and pt asymptomatic, likely [**2-20**] tachycardia
   -Rechk CE with lytes and CBC at 11am
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine 2.0 on admission now down to 1.3
   after aggressive hydration (baseline from [**2131**] appears to be 0.8).
   Most likely prerenal secondary to volume depletion, however keep AIN in
   ddx given recent NSAID use.
   - check urine lytes, urine eos
   - IVFs as above
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 123 on admission, now normalized to 136. Most likely
   secondary to volume depletion as improved with IVF.
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 3147**] Pt with WBC continuing to incr to 19.8 this am with no
   signs of symptoms of infection. Afebrile. Will continue to monitor
   closely
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus Type II: Followed at [**Last Name (un) 303**]. Overall sounds like pt
   having difficulty with qid fingersticks and insulin administration. It
   may make sense to switch to [**Hospital1 **] regimen of combined short and long
   acting insulin.
   - Will need to arrange close f/u appt.
   - Cont. secondary prevention w/ statin, aspirin. ACE-inhibitor being
   considered as an outpt.
   - Pneumovax and flu shot
 no record of pt having received either. TDAP
   given [**2140-10-19**]
   .
   # Hepatitis C: history of chronic hepatitis C and had initially been
   treated with interferon and ribavirin unsuccessfully.  He does not
   currently follow up with a liver specialist. No active issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, insulin-dependent, and hepatitis C. He presented overnight with weakness and polyuria, and was found to have a blood glucose level >1000, anion gap acidosis, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 140/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on insulin therapy, IV fluids, and has been started on a regular diabetic diet. Laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, and leukocytosis. The patient's condition is improving with aggressive hydration, and the anion gap has resolved. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2, hepatitis C, and acute renal failure. The plan is to continue IVFs, monitor closely, and arrange for follow-up appointments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's initial presentation with hyperglycemia, anion gap acidosis, and ketones in the urine suggests DKA. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The elevated levels of cardiac enzymes indicate possible myocardial injury or ischemia."

 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA) secondary to medicine noncompliance and
   possible infection given worsening leukocytosis.  No complaints
   pointing to where the infection might be.  Surveillance blood culutres
   pending.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) secondary to
   dehydration in setting of DKA. Had recently been on NSAIDS for sciatica
   - doubt this is contributing to renal insufficiency given this has
   improved with hydration.  Continue to trend creatinine.  Will also
   check urine eosinophils.
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY), pseudohyponatremia in
   setting of elevated blood sugars. Resolved.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  WBC increased despite aggressive hydration.  Will
   check repeat differential.
 HEPATITIS OTHER
   Hepatitis C
 CARDIAC:  Small enzyme leak in setting of tachycardia, severe
   dehydration.  Likely rate related.  With underlying diabetes .
   Continue ASA, statin. Echo to evaluate for evidence of wall motion

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 125/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Fluid balance has been managed appropriately, with a total input of 8,592 mL and output of 2,500 mL. The patient has received regular insulin via a sliding scale regimen for glycemic control.

EKG and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) results showed no significant changes. Cardiac enzymes remained flat, and there were no signs of infection or withdrawal. The patient's white blood cell count trended slightly down. The review of systems revealed hyperglycemia and headache, but no other abnormalities.

The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C, and previous treatment for tuberculosis. Laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and hypomagnesemia. The patient's renal function has been monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as fluid resuscitation and medication adjustment, will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hypomagnesemia:"

 HYPERGLYCEMIA
   Assessment: This is a 55 yo man with DM type 2, insulin dependent ,
   hepatitis C  who presented [**11-16**] w/ sx of weakness and polyuria, found
   to have BG >1000, anion gap acidosis, leukocytosis and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   Plan:
   # Diabetic ketoacidosis: CXR clear and U/A without sign of infection.
   However, WBC
s peaked at 23.9 now down to 15. No chest pain to
   suggestive cardiac etiology, EKG without ischemic changes but CE peaked
   at 0.11 likely [**2-20**] tachycardia/ incr demand.
   - Metabolic acidosis/Dehydration: Anion gap 27 on admission. + ketones
   in urine. Venous pH 7.33. Also w/ significant component of dehydration.
   AG closed on [**11-17**] but then opened on 11am labs to 20 and Insulin gtt
   was restarted briefly. Last night at 8p, AG closed to 10, Lantus was
   given and Insulin gtt was stopped. AG currently 10, FS overnight all
   <200.
   -RISS, Lantus 38 u Daily
   - IVF off for now, pt taking PO diabetic diet
   - rpt labs this afternoon
   - may space out FS this afternoon
   - blood, urine cx pending
   .
   # Elevated [**Name (NI) 3146**] Pt with 0.06 trop on admission. Trop  peaked at  0.11
   then down to 0.07 with no EKG changes and pt asymptomatic, likely [**2-20**]
   tachycardia
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine 2.0 on admission now down to 1.0
   after aggressive hydration (baseline from [**2131**] appears to be 0.8).
   Most likely prerenal (Fe NA 0.7%) secondary to volume depletion,
   however keep AIN in ddx given recent NSAID use.
   - IVF now off as pt is getting good PO
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 123 on admission, quickly normalized and now  134.
   Most likely secondary to volume depletion as improved with IVF.
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 3147**] Pt with WBC peak at 23.9 now 15.  no signs of symptoms
   of infection- skin, joints and mouth were all reexamined with no
   evidence of infxn. Afebrile. Will continue to monitor  closely
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus Type II: Followed at [**Last Name (un) 303**]. Overall sounds like pt
   having difficulty with qid fingersticks and insulin administration.
   - Will need to arrange close f/u appt.
   - Cont. secondary prevention w/ statin, aspirin. ACE-inhibitor being
   considered as an outpt.
   - Pneumovax and flu shot given this hospitalization.

   # Hepatitis C: history of chronic hepatitis C and had initially been
   treated with interferon and ribavirin unsuccessfully.  He does not
   currently follow up with a liver specialist. No active issues.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent, hepatitis C, and previous treatment for tuberculosis. He presented with symptoms of weakness and polyuria, and was found to have a blood glucose level over 1000, anion gap acidosis, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current assessment includes the following potential medical complications:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient presented with DKA, which is characterized by hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis. The anion gap initially was 27 but closed on [**11-17**] and then reopened to 20. Insulin therapy was restarted briefly but stopped after giving Lantus at 8 p.m. The anion gap currently stands at 10, and fasting blood sugars overnight were all less than 200.

2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes with a peak value of 0.11 troponin T. However, the troponin T levels decreased to 0.07 and the patient remained asymptomatic, suggesting a likely case of tachycardia rather than a cardiac etiology.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient had a baseline creatinine level of 0.8, which increased to 2.0 on admission but has now"
