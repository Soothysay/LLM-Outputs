   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3605**] is a 37M with a PMH s/f severe alcoholism with several ICU
   admissions for management of airway protection/withdrawl in the past,
   HCV, and HBV, found unresponsive in the setting of alcohol
   intoxication, intubated for airway protection, with incidentally
   diagnosed leukocytosis on routine labs.
   #. Altered mental status: DDX includes ETOH intoxication with level of
   280, other toxic ingestion, intracranial bleed from his fall, seizure
   from ETOH withdrawl vs. trauma. Head CT negative for a bleed, CT Cspine
   pending, and no clear toxic-metabolic abnormalities on initial labs.
   He does have a leukocytosis, however, no fevers or hemodynamic
   instability.  On propofol wean the patient is awake, moving all four
   extremities.
   -Send urine tox, serum osms
   -Follow up final read of CT C-spine and CXR
   #. Hypoxia: In the setting of alcohol intoxication, likely secondary to
   an aspiration event.  CXR is clear by my read.
   -Will follow up final read of CXR
   -STAT ABG on arrival to unit, titrate vent settings prn
   -Will keep intubated overnight, with light sedation, SBT with RISBE in
   AM, plan to extubate early
   #. ETOH intoxication: Patient has a history of withdrawl seizures.
   Also has severe anxiety at baseline, and is difficult to monitor with a
   CIWA scale, as his subjective symptoms have been unreliable
   -Will use vital signs (hyperthermia, HTN, Tachycardia)to monitor ETOH
   withdrawl, and sedate with propofol drip while intubated.
   -Can use diazapam 10mg IV prn ETOH withdrawl once extubated
   -MVI, thiamine, folic acid
   #. Leukocytosis: no current fevers, or signs of sepsis.  CXR and UA
   clear.
   -Will send urine, blood, and sputum cultures if he spikes.
   #. HCV/HBV: previous hx transaminitis, at baseline
   #. Depression/anxiety: No current treatment for this.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of severe alcoholism and previous ICU admissions. He was found unresponsive in the setting of alcohol intoxication and intubated for airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with leukocytosis on routine labs.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 113/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on invasive ventilation and multi-lumen placement.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to alcohol intoxication with a level of 280, other toxic ingestion, intracranial bleed from his fall, or seizure from alcohol withdrawal vs. trauma. A head CT was negative for a bleed, and CT C-spine is pending. The patient does not show any clear toxic-metabolic abnormalities on initial labs. The plan includes sending urine tox and serum osms, following up on final reads of CT C-spine and CXR, and keeping the patient intubated overnight with light sedation.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to an aspiration event in the setting of alcohol intoxication. The CXR is clear by the doctor's read. The plan includes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of severe alcoholism and multiple ICU admissions for airway protection and withdrawal management. He was found unresponsive in the setting of alcohol intoxication and intubated for airway protection. The patient has a history of HCV and HBV infection. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 100/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. He is awake and alert, with normal tone and purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 246 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk for complications associated with alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. Monitoring of vital signs will be used to assess for withdrawal symptoms.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure not associated with ARDS. The plan is to attempt extubation.
3. Leukocytosis: No current signs of infection or sepsis. Cultures will be sent if the patient spikes a fever.
4. Pancreatitis: Lipase levels are elevated, and the patient has abdominal pain."

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of severe alcoholism and previous ICU admissions for airway protection and withdrawal management. He was found unresponsive and intubated for airway protection, and leukocytosis was incidentally diagnosed on routine labs. The patient had altered mental status, which could be due to alcohol intoxication, other toxic ingestion, intracranial bleed, or seizure from alcohol withdrawal. However, head CT and cervical spine CT were negative for any bleeding or fractures. The patient was extubated yesterday and seems to have returned to baseline mental status. He has a history of withdrawal seizures and severe anxiety at baseline, but currently shows no objective signs of withdrawal. The patient is being monitored for signs/symptoms of withdrawal and has received MVI, thiamine, and folic acid orally. Leukocytosis has since resolved, and the patient is expected to continue normal diet and glycemic control. The patient also has a history of HCV and HBV with previous transaminitis at baseline. Pancreatitis was initially suspected due to elevated lipase and abdominal pain but has since resolved. The patient has not received current treatment for depression/anxiety. Social work was consulted, and the possibility of a Section 35 if the patient is still in the ICU on Monday was discussed. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He was successfully extubated and is currently doing well from a respiratory standpoint. The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens, seizures, and is currently on Valium for management. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte levels. There are no significant abnormalities noted in the physical examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, but he has been successfully extubated and is currently doing well from a respiratory standpoint.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to complications such as delirium tremens, seizures, and withdrawal symptoms. He is currently being managed with Valium, but close monitoring for any signs of withdrawal symptoms is necessary.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin or ambulation should be implemented to prevent this complication.
4. Stress Ulcer: Critically ill patients, like the patient in the ICU, are at increased risk for stress ulcers. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or H2 blockers should be continued to prevent the development of stress ulcers.
5. Infection: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or elevated white blood cell count, is important to prevent and manage any potential infections."
