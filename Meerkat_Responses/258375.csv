   24 Hour Events:
   CC: s/p esophageal stent placment admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory
   distress
   .
   HPI: This is a 74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA,
   s/p resection transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal
   stenting, now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory stress.
   The follow history is taken from [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 **] notes. The
   patient underwent EGD in [**2113-9-30**] for w/u anemia. She was found to
   have a gastric mass, poorly differentiated adenocarinoma. On [**11-1**], she
   underwent partial proximal gastrectomy and pylorplasty with J-tube
   placment. She was discharged home on [**11-9**] but returned to the ED later
   that day for hematemasis. EGD was done showing some clots in the
   stomach but no active bleeding. The follwing day she had another
   episode of hematemasis, was transfered to the ICU and electively
   intubated for airway protection.  She underwent repeat endoscopy which
   showed a small separtion in one portion of the esophagastric anatomosis
   with oozing. She then underwent exlap on [**11-11**] where a tear in the
   capusle of the spleen was found, but was not able to be repaired given
   concerns with disrupting the anastomosis. [**Female First Name (un) **] was controlled with
   thombin-soaked Gel foam, bleeding stopped. She then underwent an
   arteriogram showing a 6mm splnic pseuoaneurysm. She was transfussed
   multipe unitls during these few days, HCT around 26. She was on Zosyn
   and fluconazol 200mg IV daily.
   .
   She was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] SICU for treatment on the pseudoaneurysm.
   She was taken to IR for stenting of of splenic artery aneursym. She was
   weaned off the ventilator. However, she was noted to be on 3L NC duirng
   ambulance transport. Lasix was given. There was a question of vomiting
   enroute. She was then reintubated on [**11-18**] for respiratory distress and
   hypotension on [**11-18**]. She was diuresed for the following two days and
   then extubated on [**11-20**]. On [**11-20**], she underwent CT chest, which only
   showed moderate pleural effusions. On [**11-22**], she was switched from
   Zosyn to Cefepime.
   .
   During this time a CT abdomen, demonstrated perforation of the GE
   junction by the NG tube. NGT was pulled back and secured.Gastrografin
   swallow  on [**2113-11-23**] showed a contained anastomotic leak to the left of
   the remaining stomach measuring approx 6x3cm. She was then transfered
   to [**Hospital1 1**] for esophagastric stenting.
   .
   Here she underwent ERCP with placement of esophagastric metal 9cm x10mm
   stent proximal clipping. She stent placement was verified by a
   pediatric scope. She had been electively intubated prior to the
   procedure and was extubated post ERCP. Post proceedure, she was
   ordered125ml/hr NS; she likely received 400cc LR during the procedure.
   She then developed respiratory distress with respiratory rates in 40's,
   no documented hypoxia.  She was then reintubated in the PACU. She was
   given lasix 20mg IV in the PACU. She was transfered to the floor on AC
   500x 14, FI02 50%, PEEP 5.

   # Respiratory distress: Characterized as tachypnea. This is the fourth
   time she has been intubated - 1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3)
   for ERCP 4)respiratory distress. Per the family, she had significant
   anxiety on one extubation to the extent that she needed to be
   reintubated immediately [**2-13**] distress; she was anxious that her husband
   was not present. This level of anxiety may have resulted in
   reintubation today. However, there is also evidence of volume overload
   on CXR and given the rapidity with which she went into distress, she
   may have had flash pulmonary edema. No PNA, no sputum production, fever
   or leukocytosis. No hypoxia on ABG. Of note, she was sat'ing 98% on 3L
   NC prior to ERCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric cancer, who underwent partial proximal gastrectomy and pylorplasty with J-tube placement. She presented to the emergency department with hematemesis and was transferred to the ICU for airway protection. She has a history of multiple surgeries including esophageal stenting, partial thyroidectomy, mastectomy, and transurethral resection of bladder cancer. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. She also has a history of hypertension and splenic artery aneurysm that was previously stented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's repeated episodes of respiratory distress and subsequent intubations indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Anastomotic leak: The patient has a confirmed anastomotic leak at the gastroesophageal junction, which may require ongoing management and monitoring.
3. Infection: Due to the patient's prolonged hospital stay and multiple interventions, she is at risk for developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility, surgery, and cancer increase the risk of DVT/PE. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent these complications.
5. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's history of"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with recently diagnosed gastric cancer, who underwent resection and is now admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. She is intubated and sedated due to anxiety, flash edema/fluid overload, or possible pneumonia/infectious process. The latter is less likely but still a possibility given mild leukocytosis and low-grade fevers. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 81/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has been receiving various medications including propofol, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin, and lasix. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated and sedated but arousable to voice commands. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and there is no jugular venous distention. Her abdomen is soft with a midline healing incision and slight erythema but no edema or drainage. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 465 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 87 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. 

The assessment and plan include several issues: respiratory distress"

   CC: s/p esophageal stent placment admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory
   distress
   .
   HPI: This is a 74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA,
   s/p resection transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal
   stenting, now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory stress.
   The follow history is taken from [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 **] notes. The
   patient underwent EGD in [**2113-9-30**] for w/u anemia. She was found to
   have a gastric mass, poorly differentiated adenocarinoma. On [**11-1**], she
   underwent partial proximal gastrectomy and pylorplasty with J-tube
   placment. She was discharged home on [**11-9**] but returned to the ED later
   that day for hematemasis. EGD was done showing some clots in the
   stomach but no active bleeding. The follwing day she had another
   episode of hematemasis, was transfered to the ICU and electively
   intubated for airway protection.  She underwent repeat endoscopy which
   showed a small separtion in one portion of the esophagastric anatomosis
   with oozing. She then underwent exlap on [**11-11**] where a tear in the
   capusle of the spleen was found, but was not able to be repaired given
   concerns with disrupting the anastomosis. [**Female First Name (un) **] was controlled with
   thombin-soaked Gel foam, bleeding stopped. She then underwent an
   arteriogram showing a 6mm splnic pseuoaneurysm. She was transfussed
   multipe unitls during these few days, HCT around 26. She was on Zosyn
   and fluconazol 200mg IV daily.
   .
   She was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] SICU for treatment on the pseudoaneurysm.
   She was taken to IR for stenting of of splenic artery aneursym. She was
   weaned off the ventilator. However, she was noted to be on 3L NC duirng
   ambulance transport. Lasix was given. There was a question of vomiting
   enroute. She was then reintubated on [**11-18**] for respiratory distress and
   hypotension on [**11-18**]. She was diuresed for the following two days and
   then extubated on [**11-20**]. On [**11-20**], she underwent CT chest, which only
   showed moderate pleural effusions. On [**11-22**], she was switched from
   Zosyn to Cefepime.
   .
   During this time a CT abdomen, demonstrated perforation of the GE
   junction by the NG tube. NGT was pulled back and secured.Gastrografin
   swallow  on [**2113-11-23**] showed a contained anastomotic leak to the left of
   the remaining stomach measuring approx 6x3cm. She was then transfered
   to [**Hospital1 1**] for esophagastric stenting.
   .
   Here she underwent ERCP with placement of esophagastric metal 9cm x10mm
   stent proximal clipping. She stent placement was verified by a
   pediatric scope. She had been electively intubated prior to the
   procedure and was extubated post ERCP. Post proceedure, she was
   ordered125ml/hr NS; she likely received 400cc LR during the procedure.
   She then developed respiratory distress with respiratory rates in 40's,
   no documented hypoxia.  She was then reintubated in the PACU. She was
   given lasix 20mg IV in the PACU. She was transfered to the floor on AC
   500x 14, FI02 50%, PEEP 5.

   # Respiratory distress: Characterized as tachypnea. This is the fourth
   time she has been intubated - 1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3)
   for ERCP 4)respiratory distress. Per the family, she had significant
   anxiety on one extubation to the extent that she needed to be
   reintubated immediately [**2-13**] distress; she was anxious that her husband
   was not present. This level of anxiety may have resulted in
   reintubation today. However, there is also evidence of volume overload
   on CXR and given the rapidity with which she went into distress, she
   may have had flash pulmonary edema. No PNA, no sputum production, fever

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric cancer, who underwent partial proximal gastrectomy and pylorplasty with J-tube placement. She presented to the emergency department with hematemesis and was admitted to the ICU for airway protection. The patient's medical history includes breast cancer, partial thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, bladder cancer, hypertension, and a splenic artery aneurysm that was previously stented.

The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory distress, hematemesis, and for an ERCP procedure. She has evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray and may have had flash pulmonary edema. There are no signs of pneumonia, sputum production, fever, or leukocytosis. The patient's oxygen saturation has been consistently above 95%.

The patient has an anastomotic leak from a previous gastrectomy, which has been stented. She also has a J-tube in place for nutrition. The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with metoprolol and diovan. Prophylactic medications include stress ulcer prophylaxis with a PPI and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further work-up and treatment. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index of 196."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a complicated gastrointestinal history who underwent an ERCP procedure for stent placement. She experienced acute respiratory distress postextubation and required reintubation in the PACU. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, unable to provide a medical history. She has allergies to adhesive tape, Percocet, and cefepime. The patient has been receiving various medications including propofol, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and Lasix.

24-hour events include arterial line and multi-lumen line placement, EKG, and changes in medications. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/46-120/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance of 44.4 cmH2O/mL.

Physical examination reveals crackles at the lung bases, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, attentive behavior, and response to verbal stimuli. Lab results show a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric cancer, who underwent resection and was admitted to the ICU after intubation for respiratory stress. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and is ready for extubation. The patient also has an anastomotic leak following surgery and is scheduled for stenting. She had twinning in leads V5 and V6 on the EKG, but this resolved on the repeat EKG, and cardiac enzymes are negative. The patient has hypertension and is currently on metoprolol and Diovan. She is receiving tube feeds through a J-tube and has a nasogastric tube in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 132/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, and normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient is at risk for pulmonary edema post-extubation. Close monitoring will be necessary.
2. Anastomotic Leak: The patient has an anastomotic leak following surgery. Surgery consult and continued antibiotics are recommended.
3. Gastric Cancer: The patient has recently been diagnosed with gastric cancer and underwent resection"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p
   resection transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting,
   now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory stress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Failure to extubate secondary to anxiety vs.
   flash edema/ fluid overload vs. PNA/infectious process. The latter is
   less likely, but is poss. given mild Leukocytosis and low grade
   fevers.  CXR is still very wet, the pt. may need further diuresis.
   - Intubated, wean propofol and fentanyl
   - Wean sedation and FiO2
   -Another 10mg of IV Lasix, f/u UOP
   - F/u PM Lytes
   -F/u CXR after diuresis
   - nebs
   - may need ativan peri-extubation and family at bedside
   - consider peri-extubation nitro drip
   - echo to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction
   -Continue to follow fever curve, WBC counts.

   # Anastamotic leak: s/p stenting
   - cefepime day 3, fluconazole

","Based on the provided physician's progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a recently diagnosed gastric cancer who underwent resection and is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory stress. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress, which may be secondary to anxiety, flash edema/fluid overload, or pneumonia/infectious process. The note indicates that further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 132/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 365 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 89.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated and sedated but arousable to voice commands. No lesions are noted in the oral cavity, and there is no jugular venous distention observed. The patient's lungs have clear-to-amber bilaterally, and her cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm with normal S1S2 sounds"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure following extubation in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The patient experienced respiratory distress shortly after extubation and was reintubated. A chest X-ray indicated signs of pulmonary edema, likely due to poorly controlled hypertension. The patient's cardiac enzymes do not suggest an ischemic event, but there may be demand ischemia. The plan is to administer Lasix and IV nitroglycerin to reduce preload and anticipate extubation in the morning. The patient also has a history of hypertension and anastomotic leak. They are being treated with cefipime and fluconazole for the anastomotic leak and receiving nutrition through a J-tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory distress after extubation, leading to reintubation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's wet chest X-ray suggests the presence of pulmonary edema. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory function and potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Hypertension: The patient has poorly controlled hypertension, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
4. Anastomotic Leak: The patient is being treated for an anastomotic leak, which is a serious complication that can lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric cancer, who underwent resection and is now in the ICU for respiratory stress. She has been extubated and is complaining of significant nausea, which has improved with medication. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a history of anastomotic leak after surgery and requires ongoing monitoring and treatment. She also has hypertension and is receiving appropriate medications for it. The patient is currently on tube feeds and has a J-tube in place. Her lab results show mild abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and potassium levels, but all other values are within normal range. The patient's EKG showed transient changes in leads V5 and V6, which resolved on repeat EKG and with no elevation in cardiac enzymes. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema post-extubation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early intervention if needed.
2. Anastomotic Leak: Although the patient has undergone stenting, there is still a risk of anastomotic leak. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms. Surgery consult and follow-up GI recommendations should be followed.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed with ongoing use of metoprolol and diovan. Regular blood pressure monitoring and adjustment of medications as needed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with recently diagnosed gastric cancer, who underwent a resection and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory stress and subsequent intubation. The patient has been extubated and is currently alert and responsive. She is experiencing nausea and has been prescribed antiemetic medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,871 mL since midnight. The patient has ongoing respiratory support with nasal cannula and PSV/SBT ventilation. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, normal heart sounds, and a midline healing incision with slight erythema. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count and platelet levels, with slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pulmonary edema post-extubation: As the patient was intubated for respiratory stress, there is a risk of developing pulmonary edema after extubation. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and early intervention if necessary would be important.

2. Anastamotic leak: The patient underwent gastrectomy and has had an esophageal stent placed. There remains a risk of anastomotic leak, which would require surgical consultation and further management.

3. Infection: Given the patient's recent surgery and prolonged hospital stay, she is at risk for developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or surgical site infections"

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Secondary to volume overload, possible
   component of flash pulmonary edema postoperatively given poorly
   controlled hypertension. Extubated yesterday following diuresis and
   doing well.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN:  Valsartan and metoprolol.  Still not well
   controlled, don't think there is a significant pain component
   contributing at this time.  Increase [**Last Name (un) 9344**].
 ANASTAMOTIC LEAK:  Continuing antibiotics and fluconazole.  Tube
   feeds held per surgery, need to followup with them to see when these
   can be restarted.  Surgery to touch base with surgeons at [**Hospital1 **] to
   see when transfer can be arranged.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for postoperative respiratory failure. She has a history of adhesive tape allergy and itching with Percocet. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but has now been extubated and continues to receive respiratory support through a nasal cannula. She is currently on diuretics and experiencing nausea, which improved with zofran/compazine. The patient also received 1 mg of morphine for pain overnight and reported feeling tired.

The patient's allergies include adhesive tape, causing itching, and Percocet, also causing itching. She received cefipime as her last dose of antibiotics on November 27th at 12:00 AM. Her current infusions include pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Review of systems reveals constitutional fatigue, gastrointestinal nausea, genitourinary Foley, and no pain. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), current temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/79 mmHg to 122/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

 HYPOTENSION:  Patient pancultured for possibility of infectious
   etiology.  Hct dropping and abdominal exam shows increased distention,
   patient grimacing to palpation left upper quadrant, no obvious rebound
   albeit paitent sedated/ventilated.  Blood hanging.  Plan for stat CT
   neck/chest/abdomen when hemodynamically stable.  Surgery and GI service
   aware.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Intubated more for aiway
   protection in setting of cardiac arrest.  Now has been aggressively
   volume resusitated with IV NS and blood and given her known reduced
   EF/MR will likely have component of volume overload.
   Met with family for extended meeting to update them on the days

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who experienced a cardiac arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. They have undergone several procedures, including right internal jugular (IJ) placement and trans thoracic echo. The patient's labs show hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, which have been repleted. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are at risk for torsades de pointes due to fluconazole and a slightly prolonged QT interval. The patient's abdominal examination shows increased distention, and there is a possibility of intra-abdominal bleeding. A stat CT scan of the neck/chest/abdomen is planned when the patient is hemodynamically stable. The patient is also at risk for volume overload due to reduced ejection fraction (EF) and mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient's family has been informed of the situation and is aware that surgery may be required. The patient's code status is full code, and their ICU care includes glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's overall condition remains critical. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Torsades de pointes: The patient's slightly prolonged QT interval increases the risk for this type of ventricular tachycardia, especially with the use of flu"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection
   transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, intitially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory distress from
   pulmonary edema, resolved, now re-admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after pulsless
   VT/VF arrest.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest -- now with return to sinus ryhthm. No known
   cardiac history but echo with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there
   is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Rpt EKG now shows no evidence of new ischemia
   -- cycle enzymes, ROMI (expect some elevations given chest
   compressions)
   -- cardiology consult re: heparinization and further w/u
   -- cardiac monitoring, keep [**Hospital1 **] pads on
   -- continue medical management with ASA daily. Of note, received
   metoprolol and valsartan this AM, but will hold for now given
   borderline BPs. Would restart if BPs stable
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation/Resp Failure: Pt has now been intubated 5
   times (1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory
   distress following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Prior to today, the most recent respiratory distress was
   [**2-13**] flash pulmonary edema, but this is not evident on post-intubation
   CXR. She had no fever or secretions to suggest new PNA, although her
   WBC count remains elevated. CXR without new infiltrate. Her agonal
   respirations could have simply been due to associated resolved VT/VF
   arrest and shock - doubt there is a primary respiratory failure.
   -- ABG shows good oxygenation, now switched over to PSV. Wean to [**5-16**]
   today with goal of extubation in next 24 hours
   -- received about 1-1.5 liters peri-code. Would diurese with goal -1L
   today
   -- have nitro gtt available for extubation, keep BPs <150
   -- nebs standing and prn
   .
   # Probable CAD
   [**Hospital **] medical management with ASA, statin, hold BB and [**Last Name (un) 284**] as above
   -- cards c/s
   -- cycle enyzmes as above
   -- serial EKGs
   .
   # CHF - The patient was noted on Echo to have both systolic and
   diastolic CHF.
   -- fluid management as above, would diurese with lasix for goal -1L
   today
   -- holding [**Last Name (un) 284**] and BB for the moment, restart post extubation when BPs
   are stable
   .
   # Anastamotic leak: s/p stenting. Surgery has been following with no
   specific recommendations. Per them, the patient is to remain NPO, but
   may have tube feeds via J-tube.
   -- continue on cefepime, fluconazole

   return of patient to [**Hospital3 4838**]. Consider giving anxiolytics
   for the ambulance ride to decrease anxiety. Make sure blood pressure is

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a recently diagnosed gastric cancer who underwent a resection and transfer from another hospital for esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress from pulmonary edema, but has since been readmitted after experiencing a pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Return to sinus rhythm following the cardiac arrest.
- No known cardiac history, but an echocardiogram showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD), raising concerns about an ischemic event as the cause of the arrest.
- EKG now shows no evidence of new ischemia.
- Cardiac enzymes are expected to show some elevations given the chest compressions.
- Cardiology consult is recommended for further evaluation and management, including heparinization and additional workup.
- Cardiac monitoring should continue, with [Hospital1] pads remaining in place.
- Continue medical management with daily aspirin. Metoprolol and valsartan were initiated but are being held for now due to borderline blood pressures. They may be restarted if blood pressures stabilize.

The patient has been intubated multiple times: once for hematemesis, twice for respiratory distress, once for ERCP, once following extubation, and during the recent cardiac arrest with feeble respirations. Prior to today, the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed gastric cancer, who underwent resection and was transferred from another hospital for esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted to the medical floor for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then readmitted to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless VT/VF arrest. She was diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

Medical Complications:
1. Splenic artery laceration: The patient had an old splenic laceration that recently re-bleeded, leading to massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization. The cause of the re-bleed is unclear, but it could have started before the arrest or during CPR.
   - Follow-up with interventional radiology (IR) and surgery recommendations.
   - Monitor hemoglobin concentration (Hct) every 4 hours.
   - Closely monitor vitals and transfuse for any drop in Hct.
   - Maintain active transfusion with multiple units crossed.

2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and returned to sinus rhythm. There is no known cardiac history, but an echo showed LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. This raises concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
   - Repeat EKG this morning.
   - Repeat echo.
   - Check cardiac enzymes.
   - Follow up with cardiology recommendations.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration: s/p embolization by IR with recently
   stable Hcts. Patient had known old splenic laceration, but reason for
   re-bleed is unclear.  It is possible that the bleeding was exacerbated
   by CPR, but the patient had abdominal pain prior to her arrest,
   suggesting that the bleed could have begun before the arrest.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q4H
   -- Monitor vitals closely
   -- Transfuse for any drop in Hct
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest -- now with return to sinus rhythm. No known
   cardiac history but echo with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there
   is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Repeat EKG this a.m.
   -- Repeat echo
   -- Cycle enzymes
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- holding metoprolol in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- echocardiogram to further characterize and evaluate hemodynamic
   significance.
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation/Airway protection: Pt has now been intubated 5
   times (1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory
   distress following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently the patient is at high risk of aspiration given
   secretions in esophagus and requires airway protection.
   -- Most recent ABG shows good oxygenation and ventilation. Continue
   current vent settings
   .
   # Probable CAD
   [**Hospital **] medical management with statin.
   -- Hold ASA, BB, and [**Last Name (un) 284**] as above
   -- f/u cards c/s
   -- cycle enyzmes as above
   -- serial EKGs
   -- repeat echo as above
   .
   # CHF: No role for diuresis in setting of recent massive bleeding.
   .
   # Tachycardia: DDx includes hypovolemia ([**2-13**] hemorrhage), pain, sepsis.
   -- pull central venous line placed at outside hospital
   -- treat pain adequately
   -- low threshold for blood transfusion
   .
   # Anastamotic leak: s/p stenting. Prior to the patient
s recent
   bleeding, the plan was for the patient to remain NPO, with feeds via
   J-tube. Currently patient has massively distended abdomen and fluid in
   esophagus.
   -- d/c antibiotics
   -- hold TFs given massive abdominal distending and fluid in esophagus
   .
   # S/p gastrectomy:
   -- holding tube feeds
   -- Pain meds prn
   -- f/u surgery recs
   .
   # Benign HTN:
   -- holding metoprolol and diovan
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: holding tube feeds, replete lytes aggressively to maintain

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric cancer who underwent resection. She was transferred from another hospital for esophageal stenting and initially admitted to the medical floor for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. The patient was later readmitted to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest, and was diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient had known old splenic laceration, but the reason for the re-bleed is unclear. It is possible that the bleeding was exacerbated by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but the patient had abdominal pain prior to her arrest, suggesting that the bleed could have begun before the arrest.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Splenic artery laceration: The patient had a splenic laceration that required embolization. She is currently stable with recent Hcts. However, there is a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the cause is not identified. Monitoring vital signs closely, checking Hct every four hours, transfusing for any drop in Hct, maintaining active T+S with multiple units crossed, and following up with interventional radiology (IR) and surgery recommendations are important.

2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and returned to"

   Assessment and Plan
 SPLENIC HEMORRHAGE:  Now s/p emoblization by IR, serial hcts this
   morning have been stable, last transfused around [**2-14**] am.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to massive abdominal hemorrhage,
   hypotension, poor renal perfusion.  Making urine this am following
   aggressive volume resusitation with blood products and IV NS.  Cr
   slightly increased this morning. Anuric overnight up to 7 am, now

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with hypotension and intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The patient underwent embolization of the splenic artery and received blood transfusions. They are currently experiencing acute renal failure secondary to massive abdominal hemorrhage, cardiac arrest triggered by acute hemorrhage, respiratory failure due to volume overload, leukocytosis likely related to stress, benign hypertension, and other medical conditions. The patient remains intubated and sedated. They have a history of allergies, previous surgeries, and medications. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and they have been receiving aggressive volume resuscitation with blood products and IV fluids. The patient's renal function is impaired, and there are concerns about potential complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. The patient has been placed on a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Due to the patient's respiratory failure and the presence of crackles in the lungs, there is a risk of developing ARDS. This condition can lead to severe lung dysfunction and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's intra-abdominal hemorrhage and subsequent blood transfusions increase the risk of DIC. DIC is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting, leading to both bleeding and clotting"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection,
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, the patient appears to be volume-overloaded
   and would likely not tolerate extubation without further diruesis.
   -- Diurese with goal net negative 1L today
   -- Continue mechanical ventilation
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct generally
   stable although slowly trending down.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q6H
   -- Transfuse for Hct<30
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: frequent ectopy but no other events
   -- Cardiac enzymes unchanged
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- restart metoprolol
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- Echocardiogram shows fat pad but not effusion
   .
   # CHF: Volume overload
   -- Diurese slowly with goal net negative 1 L today
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 22.2.  Could be reaction to acute stress of
   bleed, but also concerning for infection. Have already pulled femoral
   line placed during code.
   -- pan culture
   -- check differential
 shows 88 neutrophils and 5 bands
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), consider adding
   gram positive coverage pending culture results
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN,
   obstruction, intraabdominal compartment syndrome.
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   -- check bladder pressure
   -- renal U/S
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Followed by surgery and GI
   -- restart tube feeding via J-tube
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN
   .
   # HTN:
   -- restart metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration: s/p embolization by IR with recently
   stable Hcts. Patient had known old splenic laceration, but reason for
   re-bleed is unclear.  It is possible that the bleeding was exacerbated
   by CPR, but the patient had abdominal pain prior to her arrest,
   suggesting that the bleed could have begun before the arrest.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q4H
   -- Monitor vitals closely
   -- Transfuse for any drop in Hct
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest -- now with return to sinus rhythm. No known
   cardiac history but echo with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there
   is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Repeat EKG this a.m.
   -- Repeat echo
   -- Cycle enzymes
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- holding metoprolol in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- echocardiogram to further characterize and evaluate hemodynamic
   significance.
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation/Airway protection: Pt has now been intubated 5
   times (1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory
   distress following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently the patient is at high risk of aspiration given
   secretions in esophagus and requires airway protection.
   -- Most recent ABG shows good oxygenation and ventilation. Continue
   current vent settings

   -- Hold ASA, BB, and [**Last Name (un) 284**] as above
   -- f/u cards c/s
   -- cycle enyzmes as above
   -- serial EKGs

   # CHF: No role for diuresis in setting of recent massive bleeding.
   .
   # Tachycardia: DDx includes hypovolemia ([**2-13**] hemorrhage), pain, sepsis.
   -- pull central venous line placed at outside hospital
   -- treat pain adequately
   -- low threshold for blood transfusion
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely [**2-13**] hypoperfusion in the setting of
   cardiac arrest and hemorrhage from splenic lac.
   -- monitor urine output and BP
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # Anastamotic leak: s/p stenting. Prior to the patient
s recent
   bleeding, the plan was for the patient to remain NPO, with feeds via
   J-tube. Currently patient has massively distended abdomen and fluid in
   esophagus.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 74-year-old female with recently diagnosed gastric cancer, who underwent resection and was transferred from another hospital for esophageal stenting.
- She was initially admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then extubated and called out to the medical floor.
- She was readmitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless VT/VF arrest and was diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
- The patient had known old splenic laceration, but the reason for the re-bleed is unclear. It is possible that the bleeding was exacerbated by CPR, but the patient had abdominal pain prior to her arrest, suggesting that the bleed could have begun before the arrest.
- The patient had cardiac arrest and is now in sinus rhythm. No known cardiac history but had an echo showing LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD, so there is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
- The patient also has a pericardial effusion found on CT chest, and an echocardiogram is needed to further characterize and evaluate hemodynamic significance.
- The patient has been intubated multiple times due to various reasons, including hematemesis, respiratory distress, ERCP, and respiratory distress following extubation.
- She is at high risk of aspiration given secretions in the esophagus and requires airway"

","Based on the provided physician's progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed gastric cancer, who underwent resection and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. She was extubated and later readmitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT/VF) arrest, followed by a diagnosis of splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions that require close monitoring and management. These include:

1. Splenic artery laceration: The patient had an old splenic laceration that re-bleed, leading to a massive transfusion and embolization. There is a need for ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin levels, vital signs, and further follow-up with interventional radiology (IR) and surgery recommendations.

2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, and her return to sinus rhythm is being monitored. There is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology. Repeat EKG, echocardiogram, and cardiac enzyme studies are recommended to evaluate the cause of the arrest. Medications such as aspirin and metoprolol are held in the setting of recent massive bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):
   Splenic hemorrhage s/p IR intervention.  Last transfused last night.
   Hct stable today, BP stable.  Following serial CBCs.
 HYPOVOLEMIA (VOLUME DEPLETION - WITHOUT SHOCK): Secondary to
   hemorrhage as above. Has been intravascularly volume repleted with
   blood products.
 CARDIAC ARREST:  PVCs on the monitor. Following electrolytes and
   repleting as needed.  Restart beta blocker.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]): Still component of volume
   overload.  Now that she is hemodaynamically stable will diurese.
   Lighten sedation.  Continue PSV.  Will reassess this afternoon
   regarding possibility of extubation.
 CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Main factor limiting her from coming off
   the vent.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  [**Month (only) 11**] be stress related in setting of massive hemorrhage
   but also need to consider infection.  Will send blood, urine cultures.
   If this continues to increase and she has fevers consider abdominal CT
   scan as the splen bleed/thrombus may become infected. Continue current
   antibiotics/antifungal therapy.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased, probable ATN secondary to bleed,
   hypotension, hypoperfusion and she did received some contrast in IR.
   Examine urine sediment, urine lytes prior to lasix, check bladder
   pressure.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Repeat labs this afternoon, consider free water
   replacement.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of volume overload and congestive heart failure. The patient also has acute anemia secondary to splenic hemorrhage and ongoing blood loss. Additionally, the patient has leukocytosis, which may be stress-related or potentially indicative of an infection. There are concerns about acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by volume overload. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and diuretic therapy may help improve the patient's respiratory status.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's congestive heart failure is limiting their ability to be extubated. Management of fluid balance and diuretic therapy may be necessary to alleviate symptoms and improve cardiac function.
3. Acute Anemia: The patient has acute anemia due to splenic hemorrhage. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and transfusing blood products as needed are essential to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count could be stress-related or due to infection. Blood and urine cultures should be sent to rule out"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric cancer, who has undergone surgical resection and esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then readmitted to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless VT/VF arrest and diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to various reasons, including hematemesis, respiratory distress, ERCP, and cardiac arrest with feeble respirations. Currently, she appears to be volume-overloaded and is on mechanical ventilation. Her hematocrit (Hct) is trending down, indicating ongoing blood loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure, leading to repeated intubation. Continuous monitoring and mechanical ventilation are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Splenic Artery Laceration: The patient has a splenic artery laceration that was treated with embolization. Close follow-up with interventional radiology (IR) and surgery is recommended. Frequent monitoring of Hct is essential, and transfusion should be considered when Hct falls below 30. Maintaining an active transfusion service with multiple units crossed is crucial.
3. Cardiac Arrest/Probable CAD: The patient had a cardiac arrest, which may be related to coronary artery disease (CAD). Monitoring on"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection,
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, the patient continues to be volume-overloaded
   on physical exam and CXR and would likely not tolerate extubation
   without further diruesis.
   - Diurese with goal net negative 2L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears stable
   at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q8H
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: frequent ectopy but no other events
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- Echocardiogram shows fat pad but not effusion
   .
   # CHF: Volume overload
   -- Diurese slowly with goal net negative 2L today
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC stable at 21.6 today.  Latest differential from
   yesterday  shows 88 neutrophils and 5 bands.  The patient continues to
   be afebrile with no localized evidence of infectious process, although
   abdomen is the most likely source.
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), consider adding
   gram positive coverage pending culture results
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN,
   obstruction, intraabdominal compartment syndrome.  Kidney U/S
   unremarkable.
   -- Send urine Eos
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   -- continuing to check bladder pressures

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed gastric cancer, who has undergone surgical resection and esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted to the medical floor for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, but was later readmitted to the MICU due to a pulseless VT/VF arrest and diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient has been intubated five times due to various reasons including hematemesis, respiratory distress, ERCP, post-extubation respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest with feeble respirations. Currently, she is mechanically ventilated and continues to be volume-overloaded on physical examination and chest X-ray. The goal is to diurese her with a net negative fluid balance of 2 liters today.

The patient's Hct levels appear stable at this point, but will be monitored closely. She has a history of probable CAD, and an echocardiogram showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. Cardiac recommendations will be followed, including monitoring on telemetry, holding aspirin, continuing metoprolol and atorvastatin, and maintaining potassium and magnesium levels.

A pericardial effusion was found on CT chest, but an echocardiogram showed no evidence of effusion. The patient is also diagnosed with CHF, leukocytosis, acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):  Hct
   has stablized following IR intervention to splenic artery.  Bladder
   pressures elevated overnight, now down to 18.  Appreciate surgical
   evaluation overnight.  If hct decreases consider repeat abdominal CT
   and/or tagged RBC scan.  INR 1.5 today, will give vitamin K.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Continues to be volume
   overloaded, requires further diuresis.  Replete electrolytes as
   needed.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely secondary to hypoperfusion in setting of
   abdominal hemmorhage and dye load in IR procedure.  Renal US
   unremarkable.  Dosing meds accordingly.  Good reponse to lasix despite
   rising Cr.  Check urine eosinophils.
 CARDIAC:  Back on the beta blocker.  Repeat echo not significantly
   changed.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Continues with only low grade fevers.  Level stable to
   slightly down this morning.  No change in antibiotics/antifungal
   therapy at this time.  Low threshold to broaden if she is clinically
   unstable.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 151/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.2 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 184 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals tenderness and distention, with grimacing during palpation. The patient has right lower extremity edema, which is more pronounced than the left lower extremity edema. The patient's neurologic examination is not fully assessed due to sedation.

The patient's assessment and plan include anemia secondary to blood loss, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, cardiac issues, leukocytosis, and ICU care. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving sed"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection,
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, the patient continues to be volume-overloaded
   on physical exam and CXR and would likely not tolerate extubation
   without further diruesis.
   - Diurese with goal net negative 2L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears stable
   at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q8H
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: frequent ectopy but no other events
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- Echocardiogram shows fat pad but not effusion
   .
   # CHF: Volume overload
   -- Diurese slowly with goal net negative 2L today
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC stable at 21.6 today.  Latest differential from
   yesterday  shows 88 neutrophils and 5 bands.  The patient continues to
   be afebrile with no localized evidence of infectious process, although
   abdomen is the most likely source.
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), consider adding
   gram positive coverage pending culture results
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN,
   obstruction, intraabdominal compartment syndrome.  Kidney U/S
   unremarkable.
   -- Send urine Eos
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   -- continuing to check bladder pressures
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds yesterday.
   -- Add IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- hold tube feeding for now
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN
   .
   # HTN:
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA
   -- continue Arimidex

   Code status: DNR
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric cancer, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications. The current admission is due to respiratory failure and volume overload. The patient has undergone several interventions including esophageal stenting, pulseless VT/VF arrest, splenic laceration with embolization, and gastrectomy with anastomotic leak.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, splenic artery laceration, probable CAD with LV systolic dysfunction, pericardial effusion, CHF with volume overload, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and anastomotic leak post gastrectomy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient is also showing signs of infection with positive neutrophils and bands in the differential count. 

The plan for the patient includes diuresis to relieve volume overload, checking electrolytes regularly and correcting imbalances, continuing mechanical ventilation, and monitoring hemoglobin levels closely due to the history of massive transfusion. The patient's cardiac status should be further evaluated, and appropriate medications should be continued or adjusted as per cardiology recommendations. The patient's abdominal symptoms and leukocytosis suggest a possible intra-abdominal infection, so blood and urine cultures should be obtained, and antibiotics should be adjusted accordingly."

   relatively clear respiratory exam)
   - Diurese with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5
   - ct wean sedation (propofol)

   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- can start checking HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- due to free water deficit. Will give 1L D5W
   maintenance
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.

   5. Leukocytosis: WBC improved to 19.0 from 21.6 .  The patient
   continues to be afebrile with no localized evidence of infectious
   process, although abdomen is the most likely source.
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), consider adding
   gram positive coverage pending culture results
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various reasons. The most recent admission was due to respiratory failure, and she has now been intubated five times. The patient also has a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory distress leading to intubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a goal to wean sedation (propofol) and decrease the pressure support (PS) to 5/5.
2. Splenic Artery Laceration: The patient had a splenic artery laceration that was treated with embolization by interventional radiology (IR). Her hematocrit (Hct) is stable at this point, but further follow-up with IR and surgery recommendations is needed.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia due to a free water deficit. She will be given 1L D5W maintenance to address this issue.
4. Possible Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): There is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology for the patient's cardiac arrest. The patient is being monitored on telemetry, and if ectopy occurs, metoprolol IV will be given. Cardiology recommendations will be followed.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has improved, but she continues to have leukocytosis. Blood and urine cultures have been sent, and antibiotics have been continued. Additional gram-positive coverage may be considered pending culture results.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a differential diagnosis including acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypoperfusion, obstruction, and intraabdominal compartment syndrome. Kidney ultrasound was unremarkable, and further investigations such as urine eosinophils, monitoring urine output, and checking bladder pressures will be done.
7. Gastrectomy Complications: The patient had a gastrectomy complicated by anastomotic leak that was treated with stenting. She has episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds, so IV Reglan has been added, and tube feeding has been held for now.
8. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and metoprolol will continue to be used. Diovan has been held due to acute renal failure and recent bleeding.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note, and the actual medical complications and management may require further evaluation and treatment."

The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of anemia, acute secondary to blood loss from the spleen, fever on antibiotics, cardiac ectopy, and anastomosis leak. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 130/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 384 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 21.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 0.8 mmol/L. The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. The patient's chest X-ray shows improved bilateral infiltrates, likely atelectasis versus effusion at the left base.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of hypertension, and his medical history is significant for anemia, acute secondary to blood loss. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 130/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 384 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to hemodynamic instability. The patient's blood cultures were obtained at 09:09 PM on 2113-11-30 and again at 03:01 AM on 2113-12-1. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 86 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 96%. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, pt is 2 L negative O/N with marked improvement
   in exam and CXR (improvement of b/l LE and UE (hand) edema and
   relatively clear respiratory exam)
   - Diurese with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5
   - ct wean sedation (propofol)
   .
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- can start checking HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- due to free water deficit. Will give 1L D5W
   maintenance
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: frequent ectopy but no other events, if ectopy
   give metoprolol IV.
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: WBC improved to 19.0 from 21.6 .  The patient
   continues to be afebrile with no localized evidence of infectious
   process, although abdomen is the most likely source.
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), consider adding
   gram positive coverage pending culture results
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN from
   hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, obstruction, intraabdominal
   compartment syndrome.  Kidney U/S unremarkable.
   -- Send urine Eos
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   -- continuing to check bladder pressures
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds yesterday.
   -- Add IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- hold tube feeding for now
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN

   # HTN:
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and was transferred from another hospital for esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted to the medical floor for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then readmitted to the MICU after a pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest, diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient has been intubated five times due to various reasons. Currently, she is showing improvement with a marked decrease in edema and relatively clear respiratory exam. The plan includes diuresis with a goal of net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today, checking electrolytes regularly and repleting potassium and magnesium levels, continuing mechanical ventilation, and trying a pressure support level of 5/5. The weaning of sedation with propofol is also being considered.

2. SPLenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) appears stable at this point. The plan includes following up with interventional radiology (IR) and surgery recommendations, checking Hct regularly, transfusing for Hct<26, maintaining active transfusion service with multiple units crossed, and considering a repeat tagged red blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Diurese with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5
   - ct wean sedation (propofol)
   .
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol, increase dosing to tid
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: WBC continuing to trend down, however concern for new
   infiltrates on CXR.  Low grade fevers.
   --Trend WBCs, fever curves
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), low threshold to
   add gram positive coverage and additional Pseudomonal coverage
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   --f/u final CXR read from today
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN from
   hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, contrast-induced
   nephropathy.  Kidney U/S unremarkable.  Bladder pressures improving,
   intraabd. Compartment syndrome unlikely.  Renal function improving
   slightly today.
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- consider re-start tube feeding today
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN
   .
   # HTN:
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA
   -- continue Arimidex

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various reasons. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated five times due to different causes, including hematemesis, respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest. Currently, the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV. The ABG results show a pH of 7.46, indicating respiratory alkalosis.

2. Splenic Artery Laceration: The patient has a splenic artery laceration that was treated with embolization. The patient's hematocrit levels appear stable, but further follow-up with interventional radiology (IR) and surgery recommendations is needed. The patient should be transfused for hematocrit levels less than 26 and maintain active temperature surveillance with multiple units crossed.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient previously had hypernatremia, which has since resolved. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's sodium levels.

4. Cardiac Arrest/Probable Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient had a cardiac arrest, which may have been related to CAD. There is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology. The patient should be monitored on telemetry and receive cardiology recommendations. Aspirin should be withheld"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl and propofol. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/75 mmHg to 104/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, fluid balance showing an input of 2,163 mL and output of 3,370 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,207 mL. The patient's urine output is 3,350 mL, and they are receiving fluids through intravenous (IV) lines.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 220, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 26 mEq/L.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 26.9% to 29.0%, platelet (Plt) count of 202, creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 1.6 to 1.7 mg/dL, glucose level of 123 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 0.8 mmol/L. Other lab values such as electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac markers are within normal range or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fever possibly due to infection, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), cardiac arrest with ventricular ectopy, and anastomosis leak. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and other supportive measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of anemia leading to hypoxia, progression of infection causing sepsis, deterioration of respiratory function, further decline in kidney function, cardiac arrhythmias, and complications related to the anastomosis leak such as abscess formation or worsening of the leak itself.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details from the patient's medical history or further examination may be necessary for a more comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including anemia, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), and anastomosis leak. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. Vital signs show elevated blood pressure and heart rate. The patient has ongoing fluid balance issues, with a negative fluid balance of 1,207 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and altered electrolyte levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening infiltrates compared to yesterday. The patient remains febrile and has a new review CXR with right-sided infiltrates, prompting concern for potential pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss from the spleen: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Monitoring hematocrit levels and joint pain output will help assess the patient's condition.
2. Fever: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient continues to have a fever. There is concern for a new infection, possibly pneumonia, as evidenced by the worsening infiltrates on the CXR. Broadening the antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin and considering gram-negative coverage may be necessary.
3. Cardiac arrest, ventricular ectopy: The patient is being continued on metoprolol to manage cardiac rhythm disturbances.
4. Respiratory failure:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient underwent surgery for a splenectomy and was found to have an anastomosis leak. He is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 152/75 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient has been receiving IV antibiotics and is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anastomosis leak: The presence of an anastomosis leak is a concerning complication that can lead to further infection and sepsis. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to manage this condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings may be required to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating possible kidney dysfunction. This could be due to factors such as hypoperfusion, medication use, or sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate measures to maintain adequate hydration and urine output should be taken."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Hold Lasix today in the setting of preparation for CT scan
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation at PS 10/5
   -Pull back ETT tube
   .
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue Metoprolol at tid dosing with holding parameters
   -- continue Atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis, Fevers: WBC continuing to trend down, however concern
   for new febrile episodes.  No clear source of infection, likely
   abdominal source vs. VAP vs. line infection vs. thromboembolic event
   --Trend WBCs, fever curves
   -- F/u Sputum, Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue broad coverage with Cefepime, Fluconazole, Flagyl and
   Vancomycin for now pending culture data
   --CT chest / abdomen and pelvis with PO and IV contrast after
   pre-hydration, Mucomyst, bicarb to look for evidence of infection.
   --Needs PIV access for contrast injection

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has been admitted multiple times due to various complications. Currently, she is in the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated five times and has experienced episodes of hematemesis, respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest. She also has a splenic laceration that required embolization, hypernatremia, probable CAD with LV systolic dysfunction, leukocytosis, fevers, acute renal failure, anastomotic leak after gastrectomy, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's repeated intubations and respiratory distress indicate ongoing respiratory issues. There are concerns about new infiltrates on the chest X-ray, suggesting a possible infection or worsening of pulmonary edema.
2. Splenic Artery Laceration: The patient has a stable hematocrit level, but there is a concern for further bleeding or complications related to the splenic laceration. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and blood counts is essential.
3. Hypernatremia: Although the patient's sodium levels have resolved, it is important to continue monitoring her electrolyte balance and consult with nephrology as needed.
4. Possible Cardiac Arrest due to CAD: The patient had a probable cardiac arrest, which may be attributed to coronary artery disease (CAD). She has LV systolic dysfunction, and there is"

   5. Leukocytosis: WBC continuing to trend down, however concern for new
   infiltrates on CXR.  Low grade fevers.
   --Trend WBCs, fever curves
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), low threshold to
   add gram positive coverage and additional Pseudomonal coverage

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has been admitted multiple times due to respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, a pulseless ventricular tachycardia/arrest, and a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, splenic artery laceration, hypernatremia (resolved), possible cardiac arrest/probable coronary artery disease (CAD), leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and complications from a gastrectomy including anastomotic leak and vomiting.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. They are being diuresed with a goal of net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today. Their electrolytes are being monitored and repleted as needed. Propofol is being weaned off for sedation.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is stable at this point, but there is concern for ongoing bleeding. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is trending down, but they have low-grade fevers and new infiltrates on chest X-ray, raising concern for pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, and cultures are being obtained.

The patient's renal function is improving slightly today, but they remain in acute renal failure. Differential diagnosis includes ATN from hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes and contrast-induced nephropathy. Kidney ultrasound was un"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with gastric CA now s/p resection with esophageal stent
   [**Hospital 9460**] hospital course has been complicated by splenic artery
   bleed, VT/VF arrest on the floor, she has had persistent issues of
   pulmonary edema driving need for continued ventilatory support.  She
   has had recurrent fever and has had a modest decrease in SBP across
   time.  This is in the absence of bandemia but is concerning for new
   source of infection with skin source suspected based on exam but
   cultures are pending.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with concern for new source of infection
   with fever and hypotension.  We will have to continue full support  in
   the itnerim with PSV now showing adequate support but with substantial
   increase in RR to maintain effective tidal volume.
   -Move to A/C support today
   -Follow ABG
   -Will use minimum of sedation at this time
   -Add MDI
s for bronchospasm noted on exam this morning
   2)Sepsis-With recurrent fevers we have abdominal source, VAP, Skin
   source, possible DVT, sinusitis and of course fungal infection
   resistant to fluconazole.  Given the above concerns we will
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Fluconazole
   -Send sputum culture and will continue to follow CXR
   -Will have to evaluate for DVT with UE and LE non-invasive studies
   -Will pursue CT scan for evaluation of abdominal source and further
   evaluate for pulmonary source as well and will move to
 contrast
   through the feeding tube and IV contrast is possible as we have
   improvement in creatinine today.
   -Wil move to pre-treat with bicarb and mucormyst
   -Will send urine for culture
   -Will check C-Diff today
   3-Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improvement in creatinine noted through today
   -Will continue to assure adequate hydration

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with gastric cancer who has undergone resection and esophageal stent placement. She has a complex medical history, including a splenic artery bleed, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest on the floor, persistent issues of pulmonary edema requiring continued ventilatory support, recurrent fevers, and hypotension. 

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a recent increase in respiratory rate to maintain effective tidal volume. The plan is to move to assisted control (A/C) support today, follow an arterial blood gas (ABG), use minimal sedation, and add MDI for bronchospasm noted on examination.

Additionally, the patient is suspected of having sepsis with multiple potential sources, including abdominal, venous catheter-associated pneumonia (VAP), skin, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), sinusitis, and fungal infection resistant to fluconazole. The plan is to continue with the current antibiotic regimen of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, and fluconazole. Sputum culture and chest X-ray will be sent for evaluation, and non-invasive studies for DVT will be pursued. A CT scan will be performed to evaluate for an abdominal source and further assess for pulmonary source. The patient may receive contrast through the feeding tube and intravenous contrast,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then extubated and transferred to the medical floor. She was readmitted to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless VT/VF arrest, diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure, requiring intubation five times. She is currently on mechanical ventilation at a pressure support of 10/5. There are concerns about new infiltrates on the chest X-ray, and a diagnostic thoracentesis is planned to evaluate worsening leukocytosis, large fluid collection on CT scan, and potential emphysema/parapneumonic effusion. The source of leukocytosis is unclear, with possibilities including intra-abdominal infection, empyema, or aspiration pneumonia. Surgery is recommended for J-tube evaluation due to bilious drainage and vomiting, and further evaluation of the esophageal stenting is needed.

The patient's splenic artery laceration has been treated with embolization, and her Hct appears stable. However, there is concern for ongoing blood loss and the need for repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, but she is at risk"

   74 yo female with gastric CA now s/p resection with esophageal stent
   [**Hospital 9460**] hospital course has been complicated by splenic artery
   bleed, VT/VF arrest on the floor, she has had persistent issues of
   pulmonary edema driving need for continued ventilatory support.  She
   has had recurrent fever and has had a modest decrease in SBP across
   time.  This is in the absence of bandemia but is concerning for new
   source of infection with skin source suspected based on exam but
   cultures are pending.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with concern for new source of infection
   with fever and hypotension.  We will have to continue full support  in
   the itnerim with PSV now showing adequate support but with substantial
   increase in RR to maintain effective tidal volume.
   -Move to A/C support today
   -Follow ABG
   -Will use minimum of sedation at this time
   -Add MDI
s for bronchospasm noted on exam this morning
   2)Sepsis-With recurrent fevers we have abdominal source, VAP, Skin
   source, possible DVT, sinusitis and of course fungal infection
   resistant to fluconazole.  Given the above concerns we will
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Fluconazole
   -Send sputum culture and will continue to follow CXR
   -Will have to evaluate for DVT with UE and LE non-invasive studies
   -Will pursue CT scan for evaluation of abdominal source and further
   evaluate for pulmonary source as well and will move to
 contrast
   through the feeding tube and IV contrast is possible as we have
   improvement in creatinine today.
   -Wil move to pre-treat with bicarb and mucormyst
   -Will send urine for culture
   -Will check C-Diff today
   3-Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improvement in creatinine noted through today
   -Will continue to assure adequate hydration

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She has had multiple complications during her hospital course, including a splenic artery laceration requiring embolization, hypernatremia, cardiac arrest with probable coronary artery disease (CAD), leukocytosis, fevers, acute renal failure, and episodes of vomiting after initiation of tube feeds.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of PS 10/5. She has a fever and hypotension, indicating a potential new source of infection. The plan is to continue full support and move to assist-control (A/C) ventilation today, follow arterial blood gas (ABG) trends, use minimum sedation, and add MDI for bronchospasm.

There are concerns about sepsis due to recurrent fevers and multiple potential sources of infection, including abdominal, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), skin, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), sinusitis, and fungal infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and a CT scan with contrast will be performed to evaluate for abdominal and pulmonary sources of infection.

Acute renal failure has shown improvement, and the patient's renal function will continue to be monitored with attention to urine output and creatinine levels. The patient's blood pressure remains a concern, and antihyp"

   74 yo female with gastric CA now s/p resection with esophageal stent
   [**Hospital 9460**] hospital course has been complicated by splenic artery
   bleed, VT/VF arrest on the floor, she has had persistent issues of
   pulmonary edema driving need for continued ventilatory support.  She
   has had recurrent fever and has had a modest decrease in SBP across
   time.  This is in the absence of bandemia but is concerning for new
   source of infection with skin source suspected based on exam but
   cultures are pending.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with concern for new source of infection
   with fever and hypotension.  We will have to continue full support  in
   the itnerim with PSV now showing adequate support but with substantial
   increase in RR to maintain effective tidal volume.
   -Move to A/C support today
   -Follow ABG
   -Will use minimum of sedation at this time
   -Add MDI
s for bronchospasm noted on exam this morning
   2)Sepsis-With recurrent fevers we have abdominal source, VAP, Skin
   source, possible DVT, sinusitis and of course fungal infection
   resistant to fluconazole.  Given the above concerns we will
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Fluconazole
   -Send sputum culture and will continue to follow CXR
   -Will have to evaluate for DVT with UE and LE non-invasive studies
   -Will pursue CT scan for evaluation of abdominal source and further
   evaluate for pulmonary source as well and will move to
 contrast
   through the feeding tube and IV contrast is possible as we have
   improvement in creatinine today.
   -Wil move to pre-treat with bicarb and mucormyst
   -Will send urine for culture
   -Will check C-Diff today
   3-Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improvement in creatinine noted through today
   -Will continue to assure adequate hydration

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, post resection, and esophageal stenting.
- She has been admitted multiple times due to respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, hematemesis, and cardiac arrest.
- The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, splenic artery laceration, hypernatremia, probable CAD, leukocytosis, and fevers.
- She has had several complications including anastomotic leak, acute renal failure, and hypertension.
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment.
- Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/53 mmHg to 161/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of multiple intubations and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation indicates a persistent respiratory failure. New infiltrates on chest X-ray raise concern for a possible new source of infection.
2. Sepsis: Recurrent fevers, leukocytosis, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis, with potential sources including the abdomen, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), skin"

   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation at PS 10/5
   -continue to autodiurese, goal euvolemia
   -Will need diagnostic thoracentesis to evaluate worsening leukocytosis,
   large fluid collection on CT scan, concerning for
   emphyema/parapneumonic effusion-> will send cytology (r/o malignant
   effusion), glucose, LDH, pH etc..

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma who has undergone multiple surgeries and interventions. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis, and other complications. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated five times due to various reasons such as hematemesis, respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest. She is currently on mechanical ventilation at PS 10/5. New infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggest possible pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient presents with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, indicating sepsis. The source of infection is unclear but could be intra-abdominal, possibly related to the recent surgery or an infected central venous line.

3. Splenic Artery Laceration: The patient had a splenic artery laceration that required embolization. Her hematocrit (Hct) appears stable, but further monitoring and management are needed.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient previously had hypernatremia, which has resolved. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is required.

5. Possible Cardiac Arrest/Probable Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient experienced a probable cardiac event during her cardiac arrest. She should be monitored on telemetry, and cardiology recommendations should be followed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and diagnosis of a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure, necessitating five intubations, and is currently intubated due to respiratory distress. She also has signs of sepsis, with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, likely originating from an intra-abdominal source. Other potential sources, such as infected central venous lines and sinuses, are less likely.

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues. She has acute renal failure, possibly due to sepsis/hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy, as well as hypernatremia, which has resolved. There is concern for an ischemic event related to possible coronary artery disease (CAD), especially given the recent cardiac arrest and evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography. Additionally, the patient has an acute worsening of renal function, and her splenic artery laceration has been managed with embolization.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications. The current admission is due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension. The patient has undergone several surgeries, including resection of the gastric cancer, esophageal stenting, and splenic embolization. She also has a history of breast cancer and is on Arimidex. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been diagnosed with an exudative pleural effusion. Her abdomen is tense and distended, with bilious fluid drainage from the J-tube site, which appears erythematous with puckered skin, raising concern for skin infection. The patient has hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory distress, hematemesis, and other reasons. There are new infiltrates on the chest X-ray, indicating a possible new respiratory issue.
2. Sepsis: The patient has fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, suggesting sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but intra-abdominal sources are suspected. Other possible sources include infected central venous lines and sinuses.
3. Splenic artery laceration: The patient"

   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has been admitted multiple times for various reasons including respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, splenic laceration, and cardiac arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU and is intubated due to respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with leukocytosis, likely due to an intra-abdominal source or empyema versus aspiration pneumonia. Other medical complications include hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and possible CAD with LV systolic dysfunction. The patient also has a history of breast cancer and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated five times, indicating recurrent respiratory distress. There are concerns about new infiltrates on the chest X-ray, suggesting possible pneumonia or worsening of the existing lung condition.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with an unclear source. It could be due to an intra-abdominal infection, empyema, or aspiration pneumonia. Diagnostic thoracentesis is planned to evaluate the leukocytosis and rule out malignant effusion.
3. Splenic Artery Laceration: The patient had a splenic artery laceration that required embolization. Hct levels are being monitored to ensure stability.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient previously had hypernatremia, which has now resolved. It is important to continue monitoring"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then readmitted to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless VT/VF arrest, diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient has been intubated five times due to various reasons, including hematemesis, respiratory distress, ERCP, respiratory distress following extubation, and cardiac arrest with feeble respirations. Currently, she is on mechanical ventilation and showing signs of hypotension.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with concerns for new infiltrates on chest X-ray. It is crucial to monitor her closely and ensure that she meets diuresis goals while maintaining volume-controlled mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient exhibits signs of sepsis, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. The source of infection is unclear but may be intra-abdominal. Other potential sources, such as an infected central venous line or sinus infection, should also be considered. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further investigations, including urine, blood, sputum, and pleural fluid cultures, are necessary. Close monitoring of the patient's response to antibiotics"

   74 yo female with metastatic colon cancer now with evolution of
   persistent sepsis in the setting of multiple intra-abdominal fluid
   collections which have been addressed with drainage but with persistent
   respiratory failure and fever despite antibiotic therapy in the setting
   of hospital course complicated by V-Fib arrest.  This is in the setting
   of continued rising WBC count and we have pursued repeat imaging and
   drainage of pleural fluid without obvious evidence of acute infection
   to provide a unifying new insult to be addressed.  This leaves us with
   persistent insult of colon cancer with intra-abdominal fluid collection
   and with worsening of renal failure and persistent respiratory failure
   all making and reasonable expectation of meaningful recovery [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9499**]
   with time.
   1)SEPSIS-This appears to be continued insult with intra-abdominal
   process and we do not have any further findings to suggest alternative
   source at this time.  Of the list of possible alternative sources the
   sinuses, central line remain possible but less likely.  Pleural
   effusion was drained and does not seem to be a primary source.  We do
   have concern for persistent collection driving picture and will have to
   consider any possible further investigations.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who has been experiencing persistent sepsis, respiratory failure, and fever despite antibiotic therapy. She has also had complications such as a V-Fib arrest and worsening renal function. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and malignancy. The patient is critically ill and on full A/C support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to have persistent sepsis, which is likely due to intra-abdominal fluid collections. Despite antibiotic therapy, there is no obvious evidence of acute infection in the pleural fluid. The ongoing insult of colon cancer with intra-abdominal fluid collection is contributing to the sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires full A/C support due to persistent respiratory failure. There is a need to maintain favorable blood gas findings and acceptable PIP levels.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening. It is important to monitor urine lytes, perform a renal ultrasound, follow creatinine levels, and check bladder pressure.

4. Malignancy: The patient has metastatic colon cancer, which is considered an ongoing insult. Further discussions are needed regarding possible treatments for the malignancy.

5. Cardiac Arrest: Although the patient had a V-Fib arrest, her rhythm has been stable since then. Ongoing monitoring is necessary to maintain stability.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting.
- She was initially admitted for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then readmitted after a pulseless VT/VF arrest and diagnosis of splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
- The patient has been intubated five times due to hematemesis, respiratory distress, and other complications.
- She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, hypertension, and a history of breast cancer.
- The patient's vital signs are unstable with hypotension and tachycardia, and she is on mechanical ventilation.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and signs of organ dysfunction.
- The patient's family has expressed their desire to stop treatment if the patient will not be able to return home independently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of multiple intubations due to respiratory distress, indicating a high risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient exhibits signs of systemic infection with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, suggesting the possibility of sepsis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has been admitted multiple times due to respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest, and splenic laceration.
- The patient has undergone several procedures including esophageal stenting, resection of gastric cancer, and splenic artery embolization.
- Current conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis, splenic artery laceration, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, hypertension, and a history of breast cancer.
- The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with current settings including Vt (Set) of 450 mL, RR (Set) of 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 169.
- Vital signs include Tcurrent of 37.7°C, HR of 123 bpm, BP of 90/47 mmHg, RR of 18 breaths/min, and SpO2 of 90%.
- Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, elevated LDH levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests.
- The patient's abdomen is tense and distended, with a midline incision, a Jackson-Pratt drain in place, and warmth and erythema around the J-tube site.
- The patient has a history of bleeding, including hematemesis and massive transfusion.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNAR (do not attempt resuscitation).
- The patient's goals of care include ongoing discussion with the family, pain management, and limitation of further aggressive interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's repeated intubations and respiratory distress indicate ongoing respiratory compromise.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, and positive cultures suggest a systemic infection, possibly originating from an intra-abdominal source or other sources such as infected central venous lines or sinuses.
3. Splenic artery laceration: The patient's history of splenic laceration and embolization may lead to ongoing bleeding or further complications related to the spleen.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and elevated creatinine levels indicate possible acute kidney injury, which can be attributed to sepsis, hypotension, or contrast-induced nephropathy.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels require careful monitoring and management to prevent complications related to fluid balance and electrolyte disturbances.
6. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate organ perfusion and could contribute to further complications such as organ dysfunction and sepsis.
7. History of breast cancer: The patient's history of breast cancer may influence treatment decisions"

          complicated intra-abdominal pathology (partial gastrectomy

   coiling, etc.)
   She continues to spike fevers and have relatively high-grade
   leucocytosis in spite of rx with vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Although
   non-infectious causes are possible, abdominal sites of infection seem
   most likely.  It therefore seems reasonable to expand coverage to
   include VRE, ESBL, and fluconazole-resistant [**Female First Name (un) **].  Have discussed
   with surgery and they feel no anatomic intervention is needed at this
   point.  We will check urine lytes and CVP, then bolus fluid, then
   reassess.  Suspect some of the ARF may be responsive to this maneuver.

She has a history of complications including a partial gastrectomy with a nastomic leak, splenic hemorrhage, and other intra-abdominal pathologies.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics but continues to spike fevers and has high-grade leucocytosis. This suggests that the current antibiotic regimen may not be effectively treating her infection. The most likely source of infection appears to be an abdominal site.

To address this, it is recommended to expand the coverage of antibiotics to include Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria, and fluconazole-resistant fungi. This broader spectrum of antibiotics should help target the suspected pathogens.

Additionally, the patient's hypotension is being managed with fluid boluses. The plan is to check urine electrolytes and central venous pressure (CVP), administer fluid boluses, and reassess the patient. It is suspected that some of the acute renal failure may respond to this fluid management approach.

Overall, the patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment for her multiple organ dysfunction syndrome."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old woman with
          Respiratory failure
          Acute renal failure
          Hypotension
          Fever and ?sepsis
          s/p VF arrest
          complicated intra-abdominal pathology
   74 yo female with metastatic colon cancer now with evolution of
   persistent sepsis in the setting of multiple intra-abdominal fluid
   collections which have been addressed with drainage but with persistent
   respiratory failure and fever despite antibiotic therapy in the setting
   of hospital course complicated by V-Fib arrest.  This is in the setting
   of continued rising WBC count and we have pursued repeat imaging and
   drainage of pleural fluid without obvious evidence of acute infection
   to provide a unifying new insult to be addressed.  This leaves us with
   persistent insult of colon cancer with intra-abdominal fluid collection
   and with worsening of renal failure and persistent respiratory failure
   all making and reasonable expectation of meaningful recovery [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9499**]
   with time.
   1)SEPSIS-This appears to be continued insult with intra-abdominal
   process and we do not have any further findings to suggest alternative
   source at this time.  Of the list of possible alternative sources the
   sinuses, central line remain possible but less likely.  Pleural
   effusion was drained and does not seem to be a primary source.  We do
   have concern for persistent collection driving picture and will have to
   consider any possible further investigations.
   -Will discuss with surgery
Gold service
   -Flagyl/Cefepime/Vanco/Fluconazole
we have > 2 weeks on Cefepime/Fluc,
   we have day #3 of Vancomycin, and we have D #6 of Flagyl
   -Will follow cultures going forward
   -In regards to CVL
site appears clean, do not have positive blood
   cultures and will maintain ongoing support pending positive blood
   cultures from the line itself.  Do not have any evidence of drainge
   from above.
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE-Patient with continued need for full A/C support
   and will maintain based upon favorable blood gas findings and
   acceptable PIP=26
   -Continue with A/C
   3)RENAL FAILURE-The patient has worsening renal function-
   -Will need urine lytes
   -Will need renal ultrasound
   -Will need for follow creatinine
   -Will check bladder pressure
   4) CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), STOMACH
   -Simply need to discuss current role of malignancy and what if any
   further treatments would be possible.
   5) CARDIAC ARREST

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of metastatic colon cancer. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, fever, and possible sepsis. The patient has had complications during her hospital course, including a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 64-133 mmHg, heart rate between 106-134 bpm, respiratory rate of 15-28 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 92%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. Her blood glucose level is also elevated. 

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications for her conditions. 

The assessment and plan include addressing the patient's sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, malignancy, and cardiac arrest. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, further deterioration of respiratory function, progression of renal failure, and complications related to the patient's underlying malignancy."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma who has been admitted multiple times due to various complications. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis, a splenic laceration, and acute renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory distress and other factors. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings.

2. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, indicating a possible infection. The source of the infection is unclear but could be intra-abdominal, infected central venous line, or sinus infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued to cover potential pathogens such as ESBL Klebsiella, VRE, and fungi.

3. Splenic Artery Laceration: The patient had a splenic artery laceration that required embolization. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) appears stable after transfusion, but further monitoring and consultation with the hospital where the embolization was performed are necessary.

4. Cardiac Arrest/Probable CAD: The patient had a cardiac arrest, which may be related to underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). Monitoring on telemetry and following cardiology recommendations are important.

   1. D/C'd Vanc and added Linezolid to cover VRE
   2. D/C'd Ceftriaxone and added Meropenem (pseudomonal coverage)
   3. D/C'd fluconazole and added micafungin for broader intra-abdominal
   fungal coverage (ie C.glabrada)
   4. Kept flagyl the same for anaerobe coverage
   - [**Location (un) 906**] wants ID consult tomorrow to figure out why they didn't really
   want micafungin instead of fluconazole
   - Checked urine lytes and urine sodium was 25, CVP was 2. Then gave 1L
   fluid, urine output didn't pick up and CVP still 2.  Then gave 1 unit
   blood plus 1L NS and rechecked urine lytes.  After 1L NS, CVP was 8 but
   PEEP was 5.  Gave another 500cc NS.  CVP increased to 12.
   - As she isn't taking po meds, dc'ed metoprolol, arimidex, and
   atorvastatin - will need to be added back if she can ever take po

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. She underwent a gastrectomy but developed an anastomotic leak requiring stenting. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. She is also experiencing sepsis with an unclear source, likely intra-abdominal. The patient has splenic laceration with successful embolization, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and possible coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory distress, which indicates a significant risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of sepsis with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. The source of infection is unclear, but it is likely intra-abdominal. This increases the risk of septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and there is a risk of further kidney damage due to sepsis, hypotension, or contrast-induced nephropathy. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hypernatremia: Although resolved for now, the patient previously had hypernatremia, which needs to be closely monitored to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old woman with
          Respiratory failure
          Acute renal failure
          Hypotension
          Fever and ?sepsis
          s/p VF arrest
          complicated intra-abdominal pathology (partial gastrectomy
   with a nastomic leak s/p esophageal stent, splenic hemorrhage s/p
   coiling, etc.)
   She continues to spike fevers and have relatively high-grade
   leucocytosis in spite of rx with vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  We switched
   yesterday to cover VRE, ESBL, and fluconazole-resistant [**Female First Name (un) **].  Have
   discussed with surgery and they feel no anatomic intervention is needed
   at this point.  Oliguria remains significant and creatinine remains
   quite abnormal.  Although non-infectious causes are possible, infection
   seems most likely except potentially for splenic hematoma.  Other
   issues as per ICU team note today.
   Prognosis is dire.  Will meet with family today.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 40 min
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. She has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, fever, and possible sepsis. The patient underwent various surgical procedures, including a partial gastrectomy with a nastomic leak and splenic hemorrhage treated with coiling. She is currently on multiple antibiotics to cover different types of bacteria, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient's prognosis is dire, and she is being provided with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and other ICU care measures. She has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of acute renal failure, further decline in hemodynamic status leading to shock, development of new infections due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines, and potential complications from ongoing surgical issues such as the nastomic leak or splenic hematoma."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2113-12-7**]
   -as per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 906**], we changed antibiotic regimen as follows:
   1. D/C'd Vanc and added Linezolid to cover VRE
   2. D/C'd Ceftriaxone and added Meropenem (pseudomonal coverage)
   3. D/C'd fluconazole and added micafungin for broader intra-abdominal
   fungal coverage (ie C.glabrada)
   4. Kept flagyl the same for anaerobe coverage
   - [**Location (un) 906**] wants ID consult tomorrow to figure out why they didn't really
   want micafungin instead of fluconazole
   - Checked urine lytes and urine sodium was 25, CVP was 2. Then gave 1L
   fluid, urine output didn't pick up and CVP still 2.  Then gave 1 unit
   blood plus 1L NS and rechecked urine lytes.  After 1L NS, CVP was 8 but
   PEEP was 5.  Gave another 500cc NS.  CVP increased to 12.
   - As she isn't taking po meds, dc'ed metoprolol, arimidex, and
   atorvastatin - will need to be added back if she can ever take po
   - PM Hct stable at 27.2

   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations.
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings,
   pt cannot tolerate PS
   -Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   -Re-assess meds that may make contribute to patient agitaion and
   discomfort. D/C

   intra-abdominal source, however other sources like infected CVL and
   sinuses are possible, but much less likely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who underwent resection and esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then readmitted after experiencing a pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest, diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure, necessitating intubation five times. She is currently intubated and on volume-controlled mechanical ventilation. There is concern for sepsis with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, potentially from an intra-abdominal source. The patient's Hct appears stable after transfusion.

There are several medical complications and concerns, including respiratory failure, sepsis, splenic artery laceration, cardiac arrest, acute renal failure, anastomotic leak, and glycemic control. The patient is also on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: There are signs of systemic infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. The source of sepsis is unclear but may be intra-abdominal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma who has undergone resection and is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to various reasons including hematemesis, respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest. The patient also has a splenic laceration that required massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis with an unclear source, a history of cardiac arrest possibly related to coronary artery disease (CAD), acute renal failure, and anastomotic leak following gastrectomy.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated multiple times and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The main concern is maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation while minimizing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of sepsis, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. The source of infection is unclear but is likely intra-abdominal. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but ongoing monitoring and assessment of blood cultures are necessary to guide further treatment.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis/hypotension or contrast"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with gastic CA and s/p partial gastrectomy who now has
   persistent respiratory failure, sepsis and renal failure.  We have had
   ongoing discussions with family and have considered maintaining full
   aggressive measures as long as chance of meaningful recovery persists.
   We have had full change in antibiotic therapy 48 hours ago with
   persistent fevers noted.  In this setting we have continued and
   worsening renal function noted with creatinine now approaching 4.0
   despite aggressive fluid support and she remains oliguric.
   1)RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
Patient with
   continued rise in Cr despite volume support, although, we do have both
   sepsis and hypotension contributing.  This has appearance of ATN based
   upon clinical picture with dye load required with CT scan to evaluate
   for definative treatment approach for intra-abdominal source of
   infection perhaps providing transient insult.
   -Will continue to support blood pressure
   -HCO3- as needed
   -Bladder pressure to be checked today although interventions are
   limited
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue with A/C support
   -Follow ABG for titration of treatment
current settings acceptable
   3)Sepsis-Likely persistent intra-abdominal source.  Antibiotics broadly
   expanded further 2 days ago.  Do have continued slow drainage.  ID
   consulted and agreement with antibiotics provided.  Will continue with
   current course of treatment.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric cancer and partial gastrectomy. She is currently in the ICU with persistent respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. The patient has been experiencing ongoing fevers despite changes in antibiotic therapy, and her renal function is worsening despite aggressive fluid support. She remains oliguric with a creatinine level approaching 4.0. The patient also has a large right-sided pleural effusion and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Renal Failure: The patient's continued rise in creatinine levels indicates ongoing renal failure. This may be due to sepsis, hypotension, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation and treatment are needed to support kidney function and prevent further deterioration.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing persistent respiratory failure, likely due to severe pneumonia and sepsis. Continued support with mechanical ventilation and titration of treatment based on ABG results are necessary to manage her respiratory status.
3) Sepsis: The patient has likely persistent intra-abdominal sources of infection, as indicated by slow drainage and fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. ID consultation and continued treatment with current antibiotics are recommended.
4) Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to overwhelming sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and rate control measures are necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, previously admitted for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then readmitted due to a pulseless ventricular tachycardia/arrest, and subsequently diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
- The patient has been intubated five times, most recently for respiratory distress following extubation.
- She is currently experiencing sepsis with an unclear source, likely intra-abdominal, but other sources are also possible.
- The patient has acute renal failure, possibly secondary to sepsis/hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy.
- She has a history of gastrectomy complicated by anastomotic leak, and is experiencing episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's repeated intubations indicate ongoing respiratory distress. She may require continued volume-controlled mechanical ventilation and careful monitoring.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension suggest sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but intra-abdominal sources are likely. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage should be continued, along with monitoring outstanding cultures. Consider switching"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations.
   - Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current
   settings, pt cannot tolerate PS
   - Continue to hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   - Re-assess meds that may make contribute to patient agitaion and
   discomfort. D/C
d Reglan
   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension) - JP fluid culture with 4+
   GNRs.  Continues to have sepsis-like picture and most likely due to
   intra-abdominal source.  Also could consider infected central venous
   lines, DVT, sinuses, aspiration pneumonitis.
   -- f/u all outstanding Urine, Blood, Sputum,JP drain  fluid Cx
   --continue  Meropenem, and Micofungin for broad coverage including ESBL
   Klebsiella, VRE and antifungal coverage, now have switched to
   Vancomycin (no longer on Linezolid)
   -- continue Flagyl
   -- IVF boluses as needed for MAP>65, consider giving blood as Hct 26.5
   -- Trend CVP
   -- f/u ID recs
   -- will switch IJ to subclavian line
   -- add C Diff
   -- consider lower extremity ultrasound to r/o DVT although less likely
   to cause hypotension/leukocytosis
   3.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- trend Hct
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD but most likely events were due to
   underlying disease.  Telemetry with episodes of atrial trigeminy and
   bigeminy.
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- Holding Metoprolol in the setting of hypotension
   -- holding Atorvastatin due to NPO status
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   6. Acute renal failure: Renal function stable at this time, likely ATN
   secondary to sepsis/ hypotension vs. contrast-induced nephropathy
   --Monitor bladder pressures
   -- monitor urine output, trend Cr
   -- maintain renal perfusion with IVF as necessary
   -- Follow lytes, ABG.  Consider bicarb if more acidotic.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and is now presenting with multiple medical complications. The patient has been intubated five times due to various reasons such as hematemesis, respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest.

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with the following assessments and plans:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on volume-controlled mechanical ventilation and will continue at the current settings. Medications that may contribute to agitation and discomfort should be reassessed and discontinued if necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of sepsis, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. The source of infection appears to be intra-abdominal, as indicated by the presence of Gram-negative rods in the joint fluid culture. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including meropenem and micafungin are being continued for coverage against ESBL Klebsiella, VRE, and antifungal coverage. Vancomycin has been switched from linezolid.

3. Splenic Artery Laceration: The patient had a splenic artery laceration that required embolization. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) appears stable at this point, but should be trended and transfused if it falls below 26.

4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, likely due to underlying coronary artery"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with gastic CA and s/p partial gastrectomy who now has
   persistent respiratory failure and renal failure and hypotension with
   likely persistence of intra-abdominal source but with continued
   drainage.  Concern for aspiration in the setting of continued absence
   of significant movement of GI tract forward is of substantial concern
   as well.  With continued fevers will have to consider line changes for
   persistent fevers at this time as well.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Albuterol/Atrovent
   -Continue with A/C support and FIO2 at current levels
   -Concerning for pulmonary edema
   -Will return to diuresis as blood pressure stabilizes
   -Patient now on day #9 of intubation
   2)Sepsis-
   -Micafungin/Meropenem/Vancomycin in place
   -Will re-site CVL today given persistent fevers and absence of new
   source seen
   -Appreciate all the input from ID consultants
   -GNR
s from JP drain are of concern but we do have ongoing drainage
   -Will work to minimize aspiration of GI contents
   3)Renal Failure-We have creatinine improving modestly but urine output
   has remained minimal.  With volume support we do have concern for
   volume overload at this time which would lead to need for consideration
   of dialysis.
   -Follow urine output
   -Follow creatinine
