   Assessment and Plan
   #. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Patient without a clear etiology
   including no history of significant alcohol use, other ingestions, CNS
   masses, or traumatic brain injury. Urine and serum tox screens
   negative, including a negative ETOH level. Osmolal gap WNL (3.5). LP
   performed in the ED did not show evidence of infection. ?Hypoxia in
   setting of SVT, unclear if arrhythmia prior to or subsequent to
   seizure. Given murmur ?embolism but suspect would have shown on head
   CT.
   -Appreciate neurology and toxicology recommendations
   -EEG and MRI today
   -Follow up CNS fluid cultures
   -Seizure precautions
   -Start Keppra 1000 mg load, 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per neurology recommendations.
   .
   #. Altered mental status. S/p intubation for airway protection in
   setting of tonic-clonic seizures. No evidence of respiratory failure.
   -Wean to pressure support in AM, will likely be extubated in the AM.
   -HOB>30 degrees, chlorhexidine swabs
   -Propofol gtt for sedation while intubated
   .
   #. AVNRT. Patient with episode of AVNRT requiring adenosine while
   having a tonic-clonic seizure. Likely developed arrhythmia in setting
   of stress.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who presented with a new onset seizure. Neurology assessment revealed no focal deficits and recommended an MRI and EEG. The patient was started on Keppra, an antiepileptic medication. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications, nausea/vomiting, and no significant alcohol use. An EKG showed no further episodes of SVT (supraventricular tachycardia). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/63 mmHg to 144/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently receiving propofol for sedation, SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reoccurrence of seizures: Given the patient's recent seizure episode, there is a potential risk for reoccurrence. Close monitoring and adherence to antiepileptic medication regimen are crucial in preventing future seizures.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections due to prolonged intubation. Implementing measures to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who presented with a new onset seizure. He has been evaluated by neurology and recommended an MRI, EEG, and starting on Keppra. The patient has allergies to sulfa medications and has a history of nausea/vomiting. He is currently on propofol infusion, famotidine (Pepcid), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the new seizure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/63 mmHg to 144/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,340 mL and output of 1,078 mL since midnight. The patient's weight remains the same at 78.2 kg. The respiratory support mode is CMV/ASSIST with set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% and ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, HCO3- of 24 mEq/L, and SaO2 of 97%.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with endotracheal tube in place. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmurs. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory/chest examination shows clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show absent pulses in both right and left upper and lower limbs. Skin is warm, and neurologic examination shows sedation with absent responses, movement, tone, and not assessed further.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL, glucose of 97 mg/dL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, and total CO2 of 23 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include seizure without status epilepticus, altered mental status (not delirium), and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient is receiving ICU care with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the floor once stabilized."

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male with a new onset seizure. He has been seen by neurology, who recommended an MRI and EEG, as well as loading Keppra. The patient has allergies to sulfa, nausea/vomiting, and a history of antibiotic use. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/63 mmHg to 144/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving propofol, Keppra, SQ heparin, and famotidine. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,340 mL, with 403 mL given through the NG tube. The total output is 1,078 mL, with 370 mL via the drain. Urine output is 278 mL. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 78.2 kg. 

Respiratory support is being provided through mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 680, and a ventilation rate of 9.5 L/min. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished, with clear breath sounds and warm skin. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation. Laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, glucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.4 mg/dL. 

Assessment and plan include generalized tonic-clonic seizures with no clear etiology, altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection, and an episode of AVNRT during the seizure. The patient is planned for an EEG and MRI, follow-up CNS fluid cultures, seizure precautions, and initiation of Keppra. He will be weaned off pressure support in the morning and likely extubated. The patient will continue to be monitored on telemetry and have a repeat EKG done. An echo is also recommended due to the presence of a murmur, and further outpatient evaluation for potential EP study may be necessary. 

ICU care includes regular diet when off the vent, adequate glycemic control, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and measures to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is planned for transfer to the floor."

   MRI brain
   MR BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS GADOLINIUM:  There is no evidence
   of
   hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.  The ventricles
   and
   sulci are normal in caliber and configuration.  No diffusion
   abnormalities are
   detected.  The hippocampi are symmetric in morphology, signal
   intensity,
   enhancement characteristics.  There are no foci of abnormal enhancement
   post
   contrast.
   A moderately large air- fluid level is seen within the right sphenoid
   air
   cell. There is moderate mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air
   cells.
   Slow flow within the right jugular bulb is incidentally noted.  The
   remaining
   vascular flow patterns are within normla limits.  A small Thornwaldt
   cyst
   measures 5 mm.
   IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable MRI brain.
   TTE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no left
   ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. There is no systolic anterior motion of the
   mitral valve leaflets. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with low normal
   systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Tonic-clonic seizures: No futher seizure activity, EEG done this
   morning, awaiting read
   -MRI showing no focal lesions
   -neuro recommends continue Keppra until discharge
   -follow up EEG results
   -will get seizure service consult and patient will need outpatient
   follow up
   2.  Arrythmia:  Bradycardic to 40's intermittantly with a dropped beat
   and subesquent ventricular escape beat.  Patient asymptomatic
   -unclear relation to seizure activity
   -will curbside EP to determine need to inpatient consult and
   possibility
   -will need outpatient EP follow up
   3.  Elevated CK's:  Likely rhabdomyolysis [**3-13**] to seziure.  Has been on
   250cc/hr NS for aggressive hydration overnight, now able to take po's.
   Cr decreasing, 1.2 today down from 1.4.
   -d/c fluids and encourage increased po intake
   -monitor CK and lytes [**Hospital1 **]

   Mr. [**Known lastname 657**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] yesterday, still no clear explanation for his
   seizures
 no structural abnormalities on CT or MRI, no evidence of CNS
   infection, tox screen negative. ?Hypoperfusion in setting of
   arrhythmia. Plan for EEG today continuing Keppra with further workup
   per neuro. No further episodes of SVT but telemetry does show sinus
   arrhythmia with PVCs
 had been bradycardic to 40
s this AM. Will
   curbside EP further regarding recommendations. TTE essentially
   unremarkable without significant valvular disease or evidence of HOCM.
   Will monitor on telemetry for now. Patient
s CKs have been elevated,
   likely seizure-related, will trend and continue hydration. Cr trending
   back down with adequate urine output, Cr likely bumped in setting of
   rhabdo.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 29-year-old male admitted with a first episode seizure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/68 mmHg to 142/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is currently on Keppra for seizure management.

The patient has a history of rhabdomyolysis, as indicated by elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. Aggressive hydration has been initiated with normal saline, and the patient's creatinine level is decreasing.

Neurological examination reveals no acute distress, attentive and with intact cranial nerves. The patient's strength in upper and lower extremities is full. An MRI of the brain shows no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, or infarction. There is moderate mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air cells and a small Thornwaldt cyst.

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reveals normal left and right atrium cavity sizes, normal left ventricular wall thicknesses, and normal regional left ventricular wall motion. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is low normal at 50-55%. The mitral and aortic valves appear structurally normal, and there is no pericardial effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was admitted with a first episode of seizure. He has a history of rhabdomyolysis, as indicated by rising creatine kinase (CK) levels. The patient received a 1 L bolus and continuous normal saline (NS) infusion, but developed hypernatremia, so the infusion was switched to D51/2NS at 250cc/hr. An EEG is planned for the patient, and he is continuing on Keppra. His head MRI came back normal, and other tests such as EKG, transthoracic echo, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were also conducted. The patient has allergies to sulfa medications and experiences nausea/vomiting. He is currently receiving Famotidine (Pepcid) and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for pain, which he does not have.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 29-year-old male, was admitted with a first episode of seizure.
- The patient was extubated successfully but remained groggy.
- He had a history of rhabdomyolysis, indicated by rising CK (creatine kinase) levels and rising creatinine levels.
- The patient received a 1 L bolus of normal saline (NS) and continued with 250 cc/hr NS. However, he developed hypernatremia, so the infusion was switched to D51/2NS at 250 cc/hr.
- Neurological evaluation revealed no acute distress, with PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), clear breath sounds, and warm skin.
- The patient was attentive, followed simple commands, responded to verbal stimuli, and had purposeful movement.
- Laboratory results showed elevated WBC (white blood cell) count, slightly low Hct (hematocrit), and elevated platelet count.
- MRI brain was unremarkable, and TTE (transthoracic echo) revealed a trivial mitral regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 50%.
- CSF gram-negative culture was positive.
- Other lab results showed elevated levels of CK, troponin-T, ALT/AST, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), and slightly elevated calcium levels.
- The patient was diagnosed with seizure, supraventricular tachycardia (SV"

   MRI brain
   MR BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS GADOLINIUM:  There is no evidence
   of
   hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.  The ventricles
   and
   sulci are normal in caliber and configuration.  No diffusion
   abnormalities are
   detected.  The hippocampi are symmetric in morphology, signal
   intensity,
   enhancement characteristics.  There are no foci of abnormal enhancement
   post
   contrast.
   A moderately large air- fluid level is seen within the right sphenoid
   air
   cell. There is moderate mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air
   cells.
   Slow flow within the right jugular bulb is incidentally noted.  The
   remaining
   vascular flow patterns are within normla limits.  A small Thornwaldt
   cyst
   measures 5 mm.
   IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable MRI brain.
   TTE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no left
   ventricular [**Year (4 digits) 692**] obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. There is no systolic anterior motion of the
   mitral valve leaflets. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with low normal
   systolic function.
