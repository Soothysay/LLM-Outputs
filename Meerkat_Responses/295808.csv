   Assessment and Plan
   66M with h/o refractory multiple myeloma s/p autologous SCT and h/o
   GERD with h/o esophagitis and dilation for esophageal ring in [**2150**],
   thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and uremia admitted for GIB associated
   with hypotension.
   .
   #. GIB: Patient with history of gastritis, without h/o GIB in past.
   High risk for bleed as is s/p defibrotide (per notes, 21 day course
   finished [**3-17**]), thrombocytopenic, coagulopathic, uremic.  Patient was
   resuscitated with  pRBCs 8 units, platelets 1 unit, FFP 4 units, ddAVP,
   cryo, and 10 L NS. Bedside EGD showed large clot in stomach up to mid
   esophagus indicating large old bleed. Ddx includes [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 331**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear,
   bleeding gastric ulcer, espophagitis, etc. No evidence of active bleed
   currently however, status still tenuous.
   - GI following, plan to reattempt EGD today and requests dose of
   azithromycin prior
   - Surgery was consulted but pt not surgical candidate
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Erythromycin 250mg IV Q6hr per GI recs to help old clot pass
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - IR for tagged RBC scan if new active bleeding
   - Check CBC Q4hrs, transfuse to keep Hct>21 or for any significant drop
   in HCT or apparent bleeding, transfuse 4 units
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50 in case pt needs procedure
   - Maintain active type and cross
   - Access: RIJ HD catheter, right femoral cordis line, R wrist 22g PIV
   - DIC workup appears negative
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely [**1-15**] volume loss from GIB. Blood pressure
   initially fluid responsive but requiring pressors prior to intubation.
   Patient on neosynephrine.  Etiology of hypotension could include
   continue bleeding, sub sufficient EF, intubation, sepsis, or sedating
   medications.
   - continue resuscitation with pRBCs and IVF
   - wean down neosynephrine as tolerated, keeping MAP>65 and CVP 10-12
   - a line placed this AM
   - hold all BP meds
   .
   #. s/p Intubation: On fentanyl and midazolam. Pt may have aspirated
   during intubation, high risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   - wean versed, shut off for now
   - continue intubated for now
   - monitor for signs of PNA
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma: admitted for chemotherapy this admission. Not
   neutropenic currently. Concern that rash represents GVHD and pt could
   have GVHD in GI track.
   - BMT team following
   - Continue neural
   - appreciate BMT recs will follow up recs in chart and likely start
   high dose steroids for subadequate cyclosporin levels and tx of GVHD
   which may be causing new rash
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Per renal, acute renal failure c/w ATN [**1-15**] CSA
   vs VOD. Undergoing HD with RIJ HD line in place. Underwent HD on [**3-23**]
   with UF of 5kg w/o problem. [**Name (NI) **] was originally due for HD [**3-26**]. Was
   given ddAVP for uremic bleeding.
   - nephrology following, no need to start CVVH today
   - monitor Cr, fluid status
   .
   #. h/o VOD: s/p defibrotide.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #. FUO workup: Patient with extensive course of multiple possible
   infections, unclear etiology for prior FUO. No fever since arrival to
   floor
   - continue daptomycin, cefepime, anidulafungin for now
   - discuss with BMT team regarding infectious workup to date
   - f/u cultures

   [**Name (NI) 129**] status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma, post autologous stem cell transplant, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) associated with hypotension. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring resuscitation with packed red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, and normal saline. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB and is currently being treated for a large clot in the stomach. There is a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing bleeding, which may require further interventions such as endoscopy or surgery.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. The patient has already received platelet transfusion, but ongoing monitoring and transfusion support may be necessary.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, including prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). This increases the risk of bleeding, especially if the patient requires surgical intervention.

4. Uremia: The patient has acute renal failure and is undergoing hemodialysis. Uremia can contribute to the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma who was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) associated with hypotension. He has undergone several interventions including dialysis catheter placement, endoscopy, and invasive ventilation. The patient's allergies include penicillins and adhesive tape, and he has a last dose of antibiotics at 06:30 AM. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 166/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with assisted ventilation. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and potassium levels, while his platelet count is low.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GIB: The patient is at high risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and uremia. He underwent a bedside esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed a large clot in the stomach up to the mid-esophagus, indicating an old bleed. Differential diagnosis includes Mallory-Weiss tear, bleeding gastric ulcer, esophagitis, etc. There is no evidence of active bleeding currently, but the patient's status remains tenuous. Plan includes consulting a gastroenterology"

   Assessment and Plan
   66M with h/o refractory multiple myeloma s/p autologous SCT and h/o
   GERD with h/o esophagitis and dilation for esophageal ring in [**2150**],
   thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and uremia admitted for GIB associated
   with hypotension.
   .
   #. GIB: Patient with history of gastritis, without h/o GIB in past.
   High risk for bleed as is s/p defibrotide (per notes, 21 day course
   finished [**3-17**]), thrombocytopenic, coagulopathic, uremic.  Patient was
   resuscitated with  pRBCs 8 units, platelets 1 unit, FFP 4 units, ddAVP,
   cryo, and 10 L NS. Bedside EGD showed large clot in stomach up to mid
   esophagus indicating large old bleed. Ddx includes [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 331**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear,
   bleeding gastric ulcer, espophagitis, etc. No evidence of active bleed
   currently however, status still tenuous.
   - GI following, plan to reattempt EGD today and requests dose of
   azithromycin prior
   - Surgery was consulted but pt not surgical candidate
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Erythromycin 250mg IV Q6hr per GI recs to help old clot pass
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - IR for tagged RBC scan if new active bleeding
   - Check CBC Q4hrs, transfuse to keep Hct>21 or for any significant drop
   in HCT or apparent bleeding, transfuse 4 units
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50 in case pt needs procedure
   - Maintain active type and cross
   - Access: RIJ HD catheter, right femoral cordis line, R wrist 22g PIV
   - DIC workup appears negative
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely [**1-15**] volume loss from GIB. Blood pressure
   initially fluid responsive but requiring pressors prior to intubation.
   Patient on neosynephrine.  Etiology of hypotension could include
   continue bleeding, sub sufficient EF, intubation, sepsis, or sedating
   medications.
   - continue resuscitation with pRBCs and IVF
   - wean down neosynephrine as tolerated, keeping MAP>65 and CVP 10-12
   - a line placed this AM
   - hold all BP meds
   .
   #. s/p Intubation: On fentanyl and midazolam. Pt may have aspirated
   during intubation, high risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   - wean versed, shut off for now
   - continue intubated for now
   - monitor for signs of PNA
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma: admitted for chemotherapy this admission. Not
   neutropenic currently. Concern that rash represents GVHD and pt could
   have GVHD in GI track.
   - BMT team following
   - Continue neural
   - appreciate BMT recs will follow up recs in chart and likely start
   high dose steroids for subadequate cyclosporin levels and tx of GVHD
   which may be causing new rash
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Per renal, acute renal failure c/w ATN [**1-15**] CSA
   vs VOD. Undergoing HD with RIJ HD line in place. Underwent HD on [**3-23**]
   with UF of 5kg w/o problem. [**Name (NI) **] was originally due for HD [**3-26**]. Was
   given ddAVP for uremic bleeding.
   - nephrology following, no need to start CVVH today
   - monitor Cr, fluid status
   .
   #. h/o VOD: s/p defibrotide.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #. FUO workup: Patient with extensive course of multiple possible
   infections, unclear etiology for prior FUO. No fever since arrival to
   floor
   - continue daptomycin, cefepime, anidulafungin for now
   - discuss with BMT team regarding infectious workup to date

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma, post autologous stem cell transplantation, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with previous esophagitis and dilation for esophageal ring. The patient was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) associated with hypotension. The patient's condition is described as high risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and uremia. The patient received 8 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 1 unit of platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), desmopressin (ddAVP), cryoprecipitate, and 10 liters of normal saline (NS) resuscitation.

The bedside esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a large clot in the stomach up to the mid-esophagus, indicating an old bleed. Differential diagnosis includes Mallory-Weiss tear, bleeding gastric ulcer, esophagitis, among others. There is no evidence of active bleeding currently; however, the patient's status remains tenuous. The plan is to repeat EGD today and request a dose of azithromycin prior. Surgery was consulted but the patient is not a surgical candidate.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, and possible graft-versus"

The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and found to have erythematous lesions in the stomach, which were clipped. However, a large clot/blood blister could not be unroofed, and the procedure will be repeated.

The patient's Hct levels have been stable, ranging from 25.8 to 28.8. The patient has been weaned off sedation and neosynephrine. The mixed venous oxygen (MVO2) level is at 78%, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is around 20.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and adhesive tape. The last dose of antibiotics given was erythromycin at 05:56 AM.

The patient is currently on several infusions, including fentanyl and midazolam. Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), which was started on 03/26/20XX at 08:29 PM, and erythromycin, which was started on 03/27/20XX at 05:55 AM.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support.

   Assessment and Plan
   66M with h/o refractory multiple myeloma s/p autologous SCT and h/o
   GERD with h/o esophagitis and dilation for esophageal ring in [**2150**],
   thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and uremia admitted for GIB associated
   with hypotension.
   .
   #. GIB: Patient with history of gastritis, without h/o GIB in past.
   High risk for bleed as is s/p defibrotide (per notes, 21 day course
   finished [**3-17**]), thrombocytopenic, coagulopathic, uremic.  Patient was
   resuscitated with  pRBCs 8 units, platelets 1 unit, FFP 4 units, ddAVP,
   cryo, and 10 L NS. Bedside EGD showed large clot in stomach up to mid
   esophagus indicating large old bleed. Ddx includes [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 331**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear,
   bleeding gastric ulcer, espophagitis, etc. No evidence of active bleed
   currently however, status still tenuous.
   - GI following, plan to reattempt EGD today and requests dose of
   azithromycin prior
   - Surgery was consulted but pt not surgical candidate
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Erythromycin 250mg IV Q6hr per GI recs to help old clot pass
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - IR for tagged RBC scan if new active bleeding
   - Check CBC Q4hrs, transfuse to keep Hct>21 or for any significant drop
   in HCT or apparent bleeding, transfuse 4 units
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50 in case pt needs procedure
   - Maintain active type and cross
   - Access: RIJ HD catheter, right femoral cordis line, R wrist 22g PIV
   - DIC workup appears negative
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely [**1-15**] volume loss from GIB. Blood pressure
   initially fluid responsive but requiring pressors prior to intubation.
   Patient on neosynephrine.  Etiology of hypotension could include
   continue bleeding, sub sufficient EF, intubation, sepsis, or sedating
   medications.
   - continue resuscitation with pRBCs and IVF
   - wean down neosynephrine as tolerated, keeping MAP>65 and CVP 10-12
   - a line placed this AM
   - hold all BP meds
   .
   #. s/p Intubation: On fentanyl and midazolam. Pt may have aspirated
   during intubation, high risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   - wean versed, shut off for now
   - continue intubated for now
   - monitor for signs of PNA
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma: admitted for chemotherapy this admission. Not
   neutropenic currently. Concern that rash represents GVHD and pt could
   have GVHD in GI track.
   - BMT team following
   - Continue neural
   - appreciate BMT recs will follow up recs in chart and likely start
   high dose steroids for subadequate cyclosporin levels and tx of GVHD
   which may be causing new rash
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Per renal, acute renal failure c/w ATN [**1-15**] CSA
   vs VOD. Undergoing HD with RIJ HD line in place. Underwent HD on [**3-23**]
   with UF of 5kg w/o problem. [**Name (NI) **] was originally due for HD [**3-26**]. Was
   given ddAVP for uremic bleeding.
   - nephrology following, no need to start CVVH today
   - monitor Cr, fluid status
   .
   #. h/o VOD: s/p defibrotide.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #. FUO workup: Patient with extensive course of multiple possible
   infections, unclear etiology for prior FUO. No fever since arrival to
   floor
   - continue daptomycin, cefepime, anidulafungin for now
   - discuss with BMT team regarding infectious workup to date
   - f/u cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma who has undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). He also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophagitis, for which he underwent dilation for an esophageal ring in [**2150**]. The patient presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) associated with hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a high risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and uremia. He was resuscitated with packed red blood cells (pRBCs), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), desmopressin (ddAVP), cryoprecipitate, and normal saline (NS). A bedside esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a large clot in the stomach extending up to the mid-esophagus, indicating an old bleed. Differential diagnoses include Mallory-Weiss tear, bleeding gastric ulcer, esophagitis, etc. No evidence of active bleeding was found currently, but the patient's status remains tenuous. The plan is to reattempt EGD today and request a dose of azithromycin prior to the procedure. Surgery was consulted but the patient is not a surgical candidate. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma, post autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He was admitted for GIB associated with hypotension and is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including fever, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, uremia, pneumonia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to his history of pneumonia and recent extubation. There is a possibility of pneumonitis or worsening respiratory distress. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support may be required.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and uremia. Active bleeding has been identified in the stomach, indicating a potential source of GIB. Ongoing monitoring and management of coagulation parameters are essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but careful monitoring is necessary to prevent any further episodes. Adjustments in fluid and medication management may be required based on the patient's vital signs.
4. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's underlying multiple myeloma requires ongoing management. Chemotherapy treatment may be planned, and the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) needs"

   with hypotension.
   .
   #. GIB: HCT stable overnight.   High risk for bleed as is s/p
   defibrotide (per notes, 21 day course finished [**3-17**]), thrombocytopenic,
   coagulopathic, uremic.  Patient was resuscitated with  pRBCs 8 units,
   platelets 1 unit, FFP 4 units, ddAVP, cryo, and 10 L NS. Bedside EGD
   showed large clot in stomach up to mid esophagus indicating large old
   bleed. But no foal bleeding lesion was identified.  Patient is to have
   another EGD today with biopsies as there is concern for GVHD in this
   patient.  Patient remains intubated.  Patient is also thrombocytopenic,
   s/p 2u PLTs.
   - GI following, plan to reattempt EGD today
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Erythromycin 250mg IV Q6hr per GI recs to help old clot pass
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - Check CBC Q6hrs, transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50
   - Maintain active type and cross
   - Access: RIJ HD catheter, right femoral cordis line, R wrist 22g PIV
   - DDAVP
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Resolved, off pressors.
   - Monitor
   .
   #. s/p Intubation: On fentanyl and midazolam. Pt may have aspirated
   during intubation, high risk for aspiration pneumonitis.
   -          Keep patient intubated for now until EGD done.
   -          Switch to propofol boluses as pt is HD stable.
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma: admitted for chemotherapy this admission. Not
   neutropenic currently. Concern that rash represents GVHD and pt could
   have GVHD in GI track.
   - BMT team following

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma, post autologous stem cell transplantation, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with esophagitis and dilation for esophageal ring. He was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) associated with hypotension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 145/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has received various medications including vancomycin, erythromycin, pantoprazole, midazolam, fentanyl, meperidine, and morphine sulfate. He also received blood products including 8 units of packed red blood cells, 1 unit of platelets, and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 5.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 25 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 5.4 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L. Other lab results include elevated D-dimer level of 8371 ng/mL, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.05.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, unassessed skin condition, and unassessed neurologic status. An endoscopic examination showed a large clot in the stomach up to the mid-esophagus indicating a large old bleed, but no active bleeding lesion was identified. The patient remains intubated and is scheduled for another endoscopy today with biopsies due to concern for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

The patient's current medical plan includes continuing pantoprazole, erythromycin, and monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding. He will undergo another endoscopy today, and his blood pressure and tachycardia will be monitored for stability. The patient is advised to keep hematocrit (Hct) >25, platelets >50, and maintain active type and cross. He has multiple lines in place including a radial arterial line and central venous lines.

The patient has a history of hypotension, which has resolved, and he is off pressors. He also has a history of multiple myeloma and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. There is concern that the patient's rash represents GVHD and that he could have GVHD in the gastrointestinal tract. The patient is being closely monitored by the BMT team.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is being managed with hemodialysis (HD) through a right internal jugular (RIJ) HD catheter. He has undergone HD on [**3-23**] with ultrafiltration (UF) of 5 kg without any problems. The patient was initially due for HD on [**3-26**] but was given ddAVP for uremic bleeding.

The patient has a history of veno-occlusive disease (V"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma post autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and uremia. The patient was admitted for GIB associated with hypotension. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. GIB: The patient has stable hemoglobin overnight. He is at high risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and uremia. The patient received 8 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 1 unit of platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), desmopressin (ddAVP), cryoprecipitate, and 10 liters of normal saline (NS). A bedside esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a large clot in the stomach up to the mid-esophagus indicating an old bleed, but no active bleeding lesion was identified. Another EGD today with biopsies will be performed due to concern for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in this patient. The patient remains intubated. Protonix 40mg IV BID, erythromycin 250mg IV Q6hr, and monitoring of blood pressure and tachycardia for stability will be continued. CBC will be checked every 6 hours, and transfusions"

   GERD with h/o esophagitis and dilation for esophageal ring in [**2150**],
   thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and uremia admitted for GIB associated
   with hypotension.
   .
   #. GIB: High risk for bleed as is s/p defibrotide (per notes, 21 day
   course finished [**3-17**]), thrombocytopenic, coagulopathic, uremic.  Patient
   was resuscitated on   pRBCs 8 units, platelets 1 unit, FFP 4 units,
   ddAVP, cryo, and 10 L NS. Bedside EGD showed large clot in stomach up
   to mid esophagus indicating large old bleed. But no foal bleeding
   lesion was identified.  Patient is to have another EGD today with
   biopsies as there is concern for GVHD in this patient.  Patient remains
   intubated.  Patient is also thrombocytopenic, s/p 2u PLTs.
   - GI following, plan to reattempt EGD today
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Erythromycin 250mg IV Q6hr per GI recs to help old clot pass
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - Check CBC Q6hrs, transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50
   - Maintain active type and cross
   - Access: RIJ HD catheter, right femoral cordis line, R wrist 22g PIV
   - DDAVP
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Resolved, off pressors.
   - Monitor
   .
   #. s/p Intubation: On fentanyl and midazolam. Pt may have aspirated
   during intubation, high risk for aspiration pneumonitis.
   -          Keep patient intubated for now until EGD done.
   -          Switch to propofol boluses as pt is HD stable.
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma: admitted for chemotherapy this admission. Not
   neutropenic currently. Concern that rash represents GVHD and pt could
   have GVHD in GI track.
   - BMT team following
   - Continue neural
   - Cont Cyclosporine 75mg IB [**Hospital1 **], check level

   #. Acute renal failure: Per renal, acute renal failure c/w ATN [**1-15**] CSA
   vs VOD. Undergoing HD with RIJ HD line in place. Underwent HD on [**3-23**]
   with UF of 5kg w/o problem. [**Name (NI) **] was originally due for HD [**3-26**]. Was
   given ddAVP for uremic bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplantation (SCT) on cyclosporine presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fevers, and rigors. The patient has been resuscitated with packed red blood cells (pRBCs), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), desmopressin (ddAVP), cryoprecipitate, and 10 liters of normal saline (NS). Bedside esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a large clot in the stomach extending up to the mid-esophagus, indicating an old bleed. Repeat EGD revealed friable lesions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/68 mmHg to 183/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool delivery device. The patient is lethargic, follows commands, oriented to the hospital and month, tachypneic, and rigoring.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 4.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 62 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL, elevated lactate de"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). He also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with esophagitis and dilation for an esophageal ring. The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), hypotension, and was admitted for further evaluation and management.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory issues, with recent extubation and potential pneumonitis. He is at high risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and uremia. The patient received a blood transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and desmopressin (DDAVP). An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) revealed a large clot in the stomach extending up to the mid-esophagus, indicating an old bleed. The patient is being monitored closely, and appropriate measures are being taken to manage his condition.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he is no longer on pressors. However, he requires ongoing monitoring. The patient is undergoing hemodialysis (HD) for acute renal failure, which is complicated by thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or vascular"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). The patient also has a history of GERD with esophagitis and dilation for esophageal ring, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and uremia. The patient was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) associated with hypotension.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:

1. Respiratory: The patient is working to breathe today and may have pneumonitis. The plan is to keep the patient approximately 2 liters negative and concentrate antibiotics.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient is at high risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and uremia. The patient received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), desmopressin (ddAVP), cryoprecipitate, and normal saline. Bedside esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a large clot in the stomach up to the mid-esophagus, indicating a large old bleed. Repeat EGD revealed friable lesions. The plan is to continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, monitor blood pressure and tachycardia for stability, hold beta blocker, check complete blood count (CBC)"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with h/o multiple myeloma and now admitted to ICU with
   significnat GI bleed now with improved hematocrit stability.  He has
   continued good tolerance of wean of O2 but has intermittent fevers and
   tachypnea across last night. This has been recurrent following
   extubation and is concerning for persistent or evolving infection.
   1)Altered Mental Status-Has significant variation in mental status
   across time consistent with delirium
this is variable across time and
   is clearly worsening in the setting of fevers and dialysis which would
   suggest metabolic insult with multi-factorial insult driving changes.
   -Continue to follow exam across time
   -No findings on head imaging from weeks ago but exam has not
   demonstrated persistent change from that time
   2)GI Bleed-Gastic level insult
source remains to be defined with
   biopsies pending.
   -Patient with persistent stability of HCT
   -Will need F/U of biopsy
   -Continue with PPI
   -HCT q 12 hours given stability seen
   -Has P-IV and will move to PICC placement
   3)Fever
Unknown Origin
has been maintained on extensive antibiotic
   regimen and is maintaining extensive antibiotic regimen
   -Daptomycin/Cefepime/Nystatin/Clotimazole/Antifungal
   -CXR to be repeated following continued negative fluid balance to view
   lungs in optimal fluid balance state
   -Will suction for sputum  sample if convincing infiltrate seen on CXR
   with fluid status optimized
   -[**Month (only) 11**] be related to GVHD and will defer to BMT team for Rx in that case
   -Medications driving fever are possible.
   -Urine Legionella pending
   -Derm to eval for possible rash source

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

- The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, admitted to the ICU for significant GI bleed.
- Hematocrit stability has improved, but there are recurrent fevers and tachypnea across the night.
- The patient is tolerating negative fluid balance during dialysis.
- The source of the GI bleed is still undetermined, with biopsies pending.
- The patient is on an extensive antibiotic regimen and maintaining it.
- There is an ongoing assessment of altered mental status, likely due to delirium, possibly exacerbated by metabolic insults and dialysis.
- The patient has chronic end-stage renal disease and is on maintenance dialysis.
- Other medical conditions include acute anemia secondary to blood loss, rash, chronic renal failure, hypotension, acute respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, pneumonia, and bone marrow transplant.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has intermittent fevers and tachypnea, suggesting a persistent or evolving infection. This could be due to pneumonia or another source of infection.

2. Delirium: The patient's mental status varies across time and is worsening, indicating delirium. This could be caused by multiple factors such as metabolic insults, medications, or underlying medical conditions.

3. GI bleed: The patient has a significant GI bleed, and the source has not yet been identified."

   Rigoring and tachypnic
   ID consulted, CMV viral load barely positive. Abx switched to
   vancomycin (for better lung penetration) and meropenem, started on
   gancyclovir. ID also suggested sending galactomannan and beta-glucan.
   Had large melanotic stool and Hct dropped after recieving one unit.
   Continued to have maroon stools so GI scoped again with elective

   66M with h/o  SCT on CSA p/w upper GIB, fevers and rigors.
   .
   #Hypotension: Transient. Resolved with decreasing propofol and recurred
   with restarting propofol. Not related to changes in HR and no beta
   blockers present. Most likely represents propofol induced vasodilation,
   doubt sepsis, cardiogenic shock or hemorrhage given that it improved
   with decreasing propofol.
   - follow BP
   - minimize sedation
   .
   #. GIB: EGD last night showed diffuse oozing lesions that were injected
   with epinephrine. Hct now stable from last check.
   - GI following appreciate recs
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - Check CBC Q4-6hrs, transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50
   - Maintain active type and cross
   - Access: RIJ HD catheter, R wrist 22g PIV, R arm 20 gauge
   .
   # Respiratory: New infiltrate appearing on CXR this am. Per ID switched
   Abx yesterday.   Still massively volume overloaded. Has not had any
   respiratory changes since being intubated.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial and extubate if remains HD stable
   -diuresing with dialysis
   - concentrate antibiotics
   - vancomycin/meropenem

   #Fevers: Still spiking fevers w/ rigors, not responding to Abx. Gastric
   Bx negative for GVHD
   - f/u gastric Bx for CMV
   - F/u ID reccomendations

   #. Multiple myeloma: admitted for chemotherapy this admission. Not
   neutropenic currently. Per derm, unlikely that rash represents GVHD and
   gastric Bx negative for GVHD.
   - BMT team following, follow up recommendations
   - check cyclosporine trough today dose accordingly
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Does not appear to be improving. Pt. stated
   wishes previously that he would not want to be on dialysis long term.
   Will continue to try to remove fluid w/ dialysis and UF.
   - family meeting re: goals of care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplant (SCT) on cyclosporine presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fevers, and rigors. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma and admitted for chemotherapy. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, GIB, respiratory issues, fevers, acute renal failure, and a history of veno-occlusive disease (VOD).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has diffuse oozing lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to further bleeding and require close monitoring and management.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has new infiltrates on chest X-ray and is massively volume overloaded. This can increase the risk of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring aggressive diuresis and concentration of antibiotics.

3. Fevers and Rigors: Despite changes in antibiotics, the patient continues to have spiking fevers with rigors. This suggests an ongoing infection, potentially due to resistant organisms or inadequate dosing of current antibiotics. Further evaluation and consultation with infectious disease specialists may be necessary.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is not improving, indicating possible acute kidney injury. Continued monitoring of renal parameters and management of fluid balance through dialysis and ultrafiltration are crucial.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma and stem cell transplantation (SCT) who presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fevers, and rigors. The patient has been admitted multiple times and has several ongoing medical complications.

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient is at high risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), coagulopathy (abnormal blood clotting), and uremia (kidney failure). He has received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 10 liters of normal saline (NS). A bedside esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a large clot in the stomach extending up to the mid-esophagus, indicating an old bleed. The patient also has friable lesions in the GI tract.

Plan:
- Continue pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
- Discontinue erythromycin 250mg IV Q6hr
- Monitor blood pressure and tachycardia for stability, hold beta blocker
- Check complete blood count (CBC) every 8-12 hours, transfuse to keep hematocrit (Hct) >25
- Transfuse platelets to keep platelet count >20, received one unit of platelets this morning

   #. GIB: EGD overnight [**Date range (1) 5469**] showed diffuse oozing lesions that were
   injected with epinephrine. Hct stable since.
   - GI following appreciate recs
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - Check CBC at 3pm and MN transfuse for HCT<25
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50, got 2 units overnight, and
   getting 2 units today
   - Maintain active type and cross
   - Access: RIJ HD catheter, R wrist 22g PIV, R arm 20 gauge
   -Try to get IR guided PICC

   # Respiratory: New infiltrate appearing on CXR [**3-30**]. Per ID switched
   Abx yesterday.   Still massively volume overloaded. Has not had any
   respiratory changes since being intubated.  CXR on [**3-31**] no change.
   - no SBT today, plan for SBT in the AM and then possible extubation

   #. Multiple myeloma: admitted for chemotherapy this admission. Per
   derm, unlikely that rash represents GVHD and gastric Bx negative for
   GVHD.  Got IVIG yesterday.
   - BMT team following, follow up recommendations
   - check cyclosporine trough today dose accordingly
 blood sent in wrong
   tube had them add it on to AM labs but concerned that could have been
   drawn through line that pt has received cyclosporine through.  Will
   continue current dosing of cyclosporine for now.
   -pt continuing to receive steroids
   -f/u UPEP checked to see if multiple myeloma is returning as this could
   change overall management and goals of care

   #. Acute renal failure: Does not appear to be improving. Pt. stated
   wishes previously that he would not want to be on dialysis long term.
   Will continue to try to remove fluid w/ dialysis and UF.

   -took 4.3L off with dialysis today, goal by end of day -2.5L
   .
   #L eye pupil less reactive today: is still reactive but less reactive
   than right eye likely due to optho examining pt in middle of the

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplantation on chemotherapy presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, fevers, and rigors. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed diffuse oozing lesions. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and is undergoing chemotherapy. He also has acute renal failure and is on dialysis. The patient's mental status is altered, and there is a concern for possible central nervous system involvement. There is a suspicion of infection, with ongoing fevers despite antibiotic therapy. The patient has a rash that is being evaluated for possible graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Other issues include potential volume overload, respiratory distress, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the findings from the esophagogastroduodenoscopy raise concerns about ongoing bleeding.
2. Infection: Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient continues to have fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is on dialysis. There is concern about the lack of improvement in renal function.
4. Volume overload: The patient may be volume overloaded, as indicated by the fluid balance chart. This could lead"

   #Hypotension: Transient. Resolved with decreasing propofol and recurred
   with restarting propofol. Not related to changes in HR and no beta
   blockers present. Most likely represents propofol induced vasodilation,
   doubt sepsis, cardiogenic shock or hemorrhage given that it improved
   with decreasing propofol.
   - follow BP
   - minimize sedation
   .
   #. GIB: EGD last night showed diffuse oozing lesions that were injected
   with epinephrine. Hct now stable from last check.
   - GI following appreciate recs
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - Check CBC Q4-6hrs, transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50
   - Maintain active type and cross

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplantation (SCT) on cyclosporine presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fevers, and rigors. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has received 2 units of platelets and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG). His blood pressure is fluctuating, and he has tachycardia. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he has new infiltrates on chest X-ray. He is massively volume overloaded. His fevers and rigors are not responding to antibiotics, and he has a negative gastric biopsy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. He also has acute renal failure and a history of veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and a plan for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, and there is a possibility of hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary, and minimizing sedation may help improve hemodynamic stability.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has diffuse oozing lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to upper GIB. Continued monitoring of hemodynamic status, transfusion of blood products as needed, and maintaining a high"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a bone marrow transplant. He presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding, fever, and rigors. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which resolved with decreasing propofol and recurred when propofol was restarted. This suggests propofol-induced vasodilation rather than sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or hemorrhage. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has stabilized, but he continues to have tachycardia. He requires close monitoring of blood pressure and should be given proton pump inhibitor therapy. The patient's platelet count is low, so he should be transfused with platelets to keep the platelet count above 50,000. He also needs an active type and crossmatch.

The patient has a new infiltrate on his chest X-ray this morning, indicating a possible respiratory infection. He is currently volume overloaded, but diuresis should be initiated. The patient's fever and rigors persist despite antibiotic therapy. Gastric biopsy results are negative for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but further evaluation for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended. The patient's multiple myeloma is being treated with chemotherapy, and he is not currently neutropenic. His rash does not appear to be GVHD, and the gastric biopsy is negative for GVHD.

   #. GIB: EGD overnight [**Date range (1) 5469**] showed diffuse oozing lesions that were
   injected with epinephrine. Hct stable since.
   - GI following appreciate recs
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - Check  Hct Q12
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50,
   - Maintain active type and cross
   - Access: RIJ HD catheter, R wrist 22g PIV, R arm 20 gauge

   # Respiratory: New infiltrate appearing on CXR [**3-30**]. Per ID switched
   Abx yesterday.   Still massively volume overloaded. Has not had any
   respiratory changes since being intubated.  CXR on [**3-31**] no change.
   - no SBT today, plan for SBT in the AM and then possible extubation

   derm, unlikely that rash represents GVHD and gastric Bx negative for
   GVHD.  Got IVIG yesterday.
   - BMT team following, follow up recommendations
   - check cyclosporine trough today dose accordingly
 blood sent in wrong
   tube had them add it on to AM labs but concerned that could have been
   drawn through line that pt has received cyclosporine through.  Will
   continue current dosing of cyclosporine for now.
   -pt continuing to receive steroids
   -f/u UPEP checked to see if multiple myeloma is returning as this could
   change overall management and goals of care

   #. Acute renal failure: Does not appear to be improving. Pt. stated
   wishes previously that he would not want to be on dialysis long term.
   Will continue to try to remove fluid w/ dialysis and UF.

   #L eye pupil less reactive today: is still reactive but less reactive
   than right eye likely due to optho examining pt in middle of the
   night.  Optho saw no evidence of CMV in eye.  Felt eye was extremely
   dry.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplantation (SCT) on cyclosporine presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fevers, and rigors. He has been admitted for multiple myeloma chemotherapy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. He has acute renal failure and is undergoing hemodialysis. The patient also has a history of vascular occlusive disease (VOD) treated with defibrotide. His mental status is altered, and he is not arousable. The patient has multiple comorbidities including GIB, fevers, acute renal failure, and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has diffuse oozing lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, which could lead to continued bleeding and potential hypotension or shock.
2. Infection: The patient is experiencing fevers and rigors, indicating a possible infection. With impaired immune function due to chemotherapy and SCT, the patient is at high risk for infections, including bacterial, viral, or fungal.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure. The presence of new infiltrates on chest X-ray suggests a possible pneumonia or worsening of the patient's underlying lung condition.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, and there is no"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplantation (SCT) on cyclosporine who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fevers, and rigors. The patient's current conditions include gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory infection, fever of unknown origin (FUO), multiple myeloma, renal failure, and mental status changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper GIB, which may continue to be a concern. Close monitoring of hemodynamic stability and continued use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be necessary.

2. Respiratory infection: The patient has been treated for pneumonia, and there is ongoing sputum culture monitoring. The patient may require continued respiratory support, diuresis with dialysis, and concentrated antibiotics to manage the infection.

3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): Although the patient has been afebrile for more than 24 hours, the underlying cause of the FUO needs further investigation. Antibiotic regimen changes may be considered based on the ID recommendations.

4. Multiple myeloma: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for multiple myeloma. Monitoring of UPEP levels and follow-up with the BMT team are important to assess the disease progression and overall management.

5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and ongoing hemodialysis is necessary. Re"

   Assessment and Plan
   66M with h/o  SCT on CSA p/w upper GIB, fevers and rigors.
   .
   #Bradycardia: during dialysis
   -will monitor
   .
   #. GIB: EGD overnight [**Date range (1) 5469**] showed diffuse oozing lesions that were
   injected with epinephrine. Hct stable since.
   - GI following appreciate recs
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - Check CBC at 3pm and MN transfuse for HCT<25
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50, got 2 units overnight, and
   getting 2 units today
   - Maintain active type and cross
   - Access: RIJ HD catheter, R wrist 22g PIV, R arm 20 gauge
   -Try to get IR guided PICC
   .
   # Respiratory: New infiltrate appearing on CXR [**3-30**]. Per ID switched
   Abx yesterday.   Still massively volume overloaded. Has not had any
   respiratory changes since being intubated.  CXR on [**3-31**] no change.
   - no SBT today, plan for SBT in the AM and then possible extubation
   -diuresing with dialysis today 4.3L taken off
   - concentrate antibiotics
   - continue vancomycin/meropenem
   -f/u sputum cx
   .
   #Fevers: Still spiking fevers, not responding to Abx. Gastric Bx
   negative for GVHD
   - f/u gastric Bx for CMV
   - ID recommendations not to change current antibiotic regimen
   - tylenol PR prn fever
   -ativan prn rigors, would not use demerol
   .
   #. Multiple myeloma: admitted for chemotherapy this admission. Per
   derm, unlikely that rash represents GVHD and gastric Bx negative for
   GVHD.  Got IVIG yesterday.
   - BMT team following, follow up recommendations
   - check cyclosporine trough today dose accordingly
 blood sent in wrong
   tube had them add it on to AM labs but concerned that could have been
   drawn through line that pt has received cyclosporine through.  Will
   continue current dosing of cyclosporine for now.
   -pt continuing to receive steroids
   -f/u UPEP checked to see if multiple myeloma is returning as this could
   change overall management and goals of care
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Does not appear to be improving. Pt. stated
   wishes previously that he would not want to be on dialysis long term.
   Will continue to try to remove fluid w/ dialysis and UF.
   - family meeting re: goals of care.
   -took 4.3L off with dialysis today, goal by end of day -2.5L
   .
   #L eye pupil less reactive today: is still reactive but less reactive
   than right eye likely due to optho examining pt in middle of the
   night.  Optho saw no evidence of CMV in eye.  Felt eye was extremely
   dry.
   -continue eye ointment
   -start vitamin to left eye, will call pharmacy to discuss what options
   there are
   .
   #Mental staus: pt not arousable today but is on propofol
   -recheck urine benzos
   -no plan for LP as risk outweigh the benefits and already on broad
   spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #. h/o VOD: s/p defibrotide.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #Nutrition: Not currently getting any nutrition. Plan for TPN
   - Nutrition consult for TPN
   - PICC line placement with IR guidance for TPN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplant (SCT) on cyclosporine presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fevers, and rigors. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Bradycardia: The patient experiences bradycardia during dialysis. This will be monitored closely.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): An upper endoscopy showed diffuse oozing lesions that were injected with epinephrine. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been stable since. The plan is to continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, monitor blood pressure and tachycardia for stability, hold beta-blockers, check CBC at 3 pm, and transfuse platelets to maintain a platelet count >50,000/mm3.

3. Respiratory: A new infiltrate appeared on the chest X-ray (CXR) on 3/30. The patient is massively volume overloaded but has not shown any respiratory changes since being intubated. The CXR on 3/31 showed no change. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the morning and then consider possible extubation. Diuresis with dialysis is being continued, and concentrated antibiotics will be used.

4. Fevers: The patient continues to have fevers that are not"

   #Hypotension: Transient. Resolved with decreasing propofol and recurred
   with restarting propofol. Not related to changes in HR and no beta
   blockers present. Most likely represents propofol induced vasodilation,
   doubt sepsis, cardiogenic shock or hemorrhage given that it improved
   with decreasing propofol.
   - follow BP
   - minimize sedation
    #. GIB: Hct now stable from last check.
   - GI following appreciate recs
   - Continue protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Monitor BP and tachycardia for stablity, hold beta blocker
   - Check CBC Q4-6hrs, transfuse to keep Hct>25
   - transfuse platelets to keep Plt>50
   - Maintain active type and cross
    - Access: RIJ HD catheter, R wrist 22g PIV, R arm 20 gauge
    # Respiratory: New infiltrate appearing on CXR this am. Per ID
   switched Abx yesterday.   Volume overloaded but improved. Has not had
   any respiratory changes since being intubated.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial successful
    -diuresing with dialysis
    - vancomycin/meropenem
   -Will extubate this afternoon.

    #. Multiple myeloma: admitted for chemotherapy this admission. Not
   neutropenic currently. Per derm, unlikely that rash represents GVHD and
   gastric Bx negative for GVHD.
   - BMT team following, follow up recommendations. Full body CT per BMT
   to look for other sources of infection.
   - check cyclosporine trough today dose accordingly
    #. Acute renal failure: Does not appear to be improving. Pt. stated
   wishes previously that he would not want to be on dialysis long term.
   Will continue to try to remove fluid w/ dialysis and UF. Resp status
   will improve with diuresis

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplantation (SCT) on cyclosporine presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fevers, and rigors. The patient has multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory issues with pneumonia concerns, fever of unknown origin (FUO), multiple myeloma, renal failure, mental status improvement, and a history of veno-occlusive disease (VOD).

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
- Heart rate: 62 bpm (normal range: 50-90 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 162/89 mmHg (previous readings: 150/82 mmHg and 177/113 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-32 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on nasal cannula

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 3.2 K/uL (previous readings: 2.8 K/uL and 3.0 K/uL)
- Hematocrit: 25.3% (previous readings: 25.6%, 25.4%, 26.5%, and 25.7%)
- Platelet count: 56 (previous readings: 43, 34, 44, 51, and 41)
- Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL (previous reading: 4.6 mg/dL)
- Blood glucose: 159 mg/dL (previous reading: 145 mg/dL)

The patient's physical examination reveals:
- General: Sedated on the vent, not responding to commands or withdrawing from painful stimuli
- HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive to light, less erythema of face
- Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs or gallops
- Lungs: Coarse breath sounds in right upper lobe
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present
- Extremities: Trace lower extremity edema

The patient's plan includes avoiding placement of a nasogastric tube due to friable mucosa, continuing proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, monitoring blood pressure and tachycardia for stability, holding beta blocker, checking hemoglobin (Hct) every 12 hours, maintaining active temperature control, and transfusing platelets to keep platelet count above 20,000/uL. The patient also requires respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and a FiO2 of 40%. Further management includes treating for presumed pneumonia, diuresing with ultrafiltration, continuing vancomycin and meropenem, and following up"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplant on chemotherapy presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and fevers. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently extubated. The patient has multiple medical conditions including multiple myeloma, acute renal failure, and a history of VOD (veno-occlusive disease). He is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are concerns about his gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid overload, and potential respiratory issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper gastrointestinal bleeding needs to be closely monitored for any signs of re-bleeding or worsening condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient's transient hypotension should be continuously monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to maintain stable blood pressure.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating fluid overload. This needs to be managed to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening renal function.
4. Respiratory issues: The presence of new infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggests a possible respiratory infection or worsening of the patient's underlying lung condition. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is no improvement in acute renal failure. Continued monitoring and management of renal function are crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplantation on cyclosporine presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fever, and unknown origin. The patient is currently in the ICU for multiple reasons including gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, renal failure, and multiple myeloma. The patient's current vital signs show stable blood pressure, slightly elevated heart rate, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is massively fluid overloaded but does not appear to have any new blistering. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving various medications including proton pump inhibitors, diuretics, and antibiotics. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and plans are in place for further evaluation and treatment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper gastrointestinal bleeding needs to be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent further bleeding. 
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and the non-functioning hemodialysis (HD) catheter needs to be replaced as soon as possible. 
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and fever of unknown origin raise concerns about potential infections. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and imaging studies will help identify and manage any infectious complications. 
4. Multiple myeloma: The"
