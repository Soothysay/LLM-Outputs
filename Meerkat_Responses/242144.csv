","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. She has undergone cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant stenosis in multiple coronary vessels. The patient was scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on September 26th but is currently in the ICU due to NSTEMI and suspected sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/56 to 92/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The patient's general appearance is pleasant, and she is oriented x3 with appropriate mood and affect.

The physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the head, neck, cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal systems. Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, and pulses are bilaterally present and equal in strength. Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, troponin T, and troponin I, as well as mildly elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures are pending, and urine and sputum cultures have been ordered.

The patient's current plan includes continuing heparin infusion, holding nitro patch, and monitoring for potential catheterization. She is also receiving levofloxacin and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and sepsis. She has been diagnosed with triple vessel disease (3VD) and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypercalcemia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and hypertension. She is currently being treated with various medications and has ongoing infections that require antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiovascular Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, previous MI, and 3VD, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as unstable angina, recurrent MI, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and is receiving antibiotic treatment. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of new infections, especially with prolonged ICU stay.
3. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation included sepsis, and there is a possibility of recurrence due to ongoing infections or inadequate response to antibiotic therapy.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, which can have various implications, including renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone demineralization.
5. Liver Dysfunction:"

   ECHO [**2125-9-12**]:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   hypokinesis of the distal septum. The remaining segments contract
   normally (LVEF = 50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-9-3**], the mild
   septal wall motion abnormality is new.

   ECHO [**2125-9-12**]:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   hypokinesis of the distal septum. The remaining segments contract
   normally (LVEF = 50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-9-3**], the mild
   septal wall motion abnormality is new.
   CXR [**2125-9-12**]:
   Comparisons with a study of [**9-11**], the patient has taken a much
   better inspiration. Cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal
   limits
   and there is no vascular congestion. Blunting of the left costophrenic
   angle
   could reflect pleural fluid or thickening.
   No evidence of acute focal pneumonia at this time.

   ECHO [**2125-9-12**]:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   hypokinesis of the distal septum. The remaining segments contract
   normally (LVEF = 50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-9-3**], the mild
   septal wall motion abnormality is new.

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), who is currently awaiting five-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on September 26th. She was transferred from another hospital with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome/sepsis (SIRS/sepsis) from presumed pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals mild anxiety, oriented to time, place, and person, with appropriate mood and affect. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are crackles in the right lung base, and the abdomen is soft with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis, and the skin is intact without rashes or ulcers.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, mild leukocytosis, and slightly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Blood cultures are pending. The ECG shows ST segment depression in leads II, III, AVF, and V4"

   ECHO [**2125-9-12**]:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   hypokinesis of the distal septum. The remaining segments contract
   normally (LVEF = 50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-9-3**], the mild
   septal wall motion abnormality is new.
   CXR [**2125-9-12**]:
   Comparisons with a study of [**9-11**], the patient has taken a much
   better inspiration. Cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal
   limits
   and there is no vascular congestion. Blunting of the left costophrenic
   angle
   could reflect pleural fluid or thickening.
   No evidence of acute focal pneumonia at this time.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has been admitted to the ICU for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and sepsis. She was initially transferred from another hospital with pneumonia and suspected sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 115/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. She is in sinus rhythm and her physical examination reveals mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal septum, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and trace aortic regurgitation. There is also a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion noted.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and troponin levels, consistent with an acute cardiac event. Her blood cultures are pending. The ECG shows ST-segment depression in leads II, III, and AVF, as well as V4-V6, indicating ischemia.

The patient's previous echocardiogram from September 3rd showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (>60%), but the most recent echo from yesterday showed a decrease in ejection fraction to 50% and a new mild septal wall motion abnormality."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), coronary artery disease (CAD), and anxiety. She was admitted to the ICU due to activity intolerance and fever. The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin) for an infection. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 130/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight is currently 75 kg, and she has received a total of 1,840 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 840 mL given intravenously. The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T levels, but otherwise, most values are within normal range. The patient's activity intolerance and anxiety have been managed appropriately. The patient's liver function abnormalities and fever have improved. The patient is expected to undergo a CT abdomen examination for pre-operative clearance before her upcoming CABG surgery on [**9-26**].

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and recent antibiotic use suggest the possibility of an ongoing or recent infection."

The patient's mood and affect are appropriate, and she is oriented x3. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general, HEENT, neck, cardiac, or abdominal areas. There are crackles heard in the right > left lung bases. Extremities show no clubbing, edema, or femoral bruits. Skin examination is also unremarkable. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin-T levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin for prophylaxis, antibiotics, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) - The patient's history of SLE may lead to complications such as kidney involvement, heart involvement (e.g., pericarditis), or central nervous system involvement.
2. Liver Function Abnormalities - The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) indicate potential liver dysfunction. This could be due to various reasons, including medication side effects or underlying liver disease.

- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and triple vessel disease (3VD) confirmed by cardiac catheterization. She is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on 9/26.
- The patient was transferred from another hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome/sepsis (SIRS/sepsis) likely due to pneumonia (PNA).
- She has been loaded with Plavix but will hold it given the potential CABG.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and troponin) have peaked and are declining.
- She is currently on aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, and isosorbide dinitrate.
- Imaging revealed apical hypokinesis, evidence of reversible anteroseptal and anteroapical perfusion abnormality. A recent echo showed a new mild septal wall motion abnormality with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50%.
- The patient's rhythm has been sinus tachycardic initially but is now normal sinus rhythm (NSR).
- She had a fever and leukocytosis, but is now afebrile with a stable white blood cell count.
- She received Levofloxacin and Vancomycin at the previous hospital for healthcare-associated pneumonia ("

She has been diagnosed with triple vessel disease (3VD) and is awaiting a scheduled coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on September 26th. The patient was transferred from another hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and sepsis secondary to presumed pneumonia (PNA).

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.4Â°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/68 to 133/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in the heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, or skin. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal creatinine levels. Electrolytes show mild hypokalemia and hypercalcemia, which has since resolved.

The patient has several medical conditions and plans, including coronary artery disease with 3VD, previous MI, NSTEMI, sepsis, hypercalcemia, elevated liver enzymes, suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and anxiety. She is currently being treated with"
