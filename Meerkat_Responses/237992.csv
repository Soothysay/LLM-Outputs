   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old man with Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer and
   history of GI bleeding, presenting with new episode of hematemesis, in
   fair condition.
   # Hematemesis: Likely due to an ulcer versus radiation esophagitis
   versus a variceal bleed. Given the pt's history of GE jxn bleeding in
   the past, suspect another lesion at this site to be the source of the
   bleeding. Per the patient's HCP and daughter [**Name (NI) 5324**], the pt is Jehovah
   Witness and would not want blood products.
   - Confirmed JW status with patient
   - PPI gtt per GI recs
   - Maintain two 18 gauge antecubital IVs
   - Telemetry to monitor tachycardia
   - surgery following
   # Anemia: The pt's baseline hct is 33-34, but the pt may have had acute
   blood loss secondary to bleed which may not be reflected in the CBC.
   There may also be a component of ACD secondary to malignancy.
   - Trend hct q8h
   - See above treatment plan for evaluation of likely source of bleeding
   # Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia: Likely myelosuppression secondary to
   metastatic prostate cancer, but counts are at the pt's recent baseline
   (since 5/[**2160**]).
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypertension: Hold home regimen (toprol, lasix) in order to follow
   tachycardia. Hold lisinopril as the pt may develop hypotension in the
   setting of bleeding.
   - Restart lisinopril, metoprolol, lasix as the pt stabilizes.
   # CAD: Hold aspirin.
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: Currently s/p XRT to spine.
   - Outpatient f/u
   - Management per primary oncologist
   - Continue BPH meds
   # Depression: Continue home celexa and trazodone.
   # Hepatitis C: Not active currently. Unclear if pt has a physician who
   manages his Hep C.
   - Outpatient follow up.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Not anticoagulated.
   - Given GI bleed agree with plan no to start anticoagulation.
   FEN: NPO for now until GI clearance
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen per home regimen
   -Pain management with tylenol per home regimen
   ACCESS: PIV's
   CODE STATUS: full; however per daughter pt is Jehovah Witness and does
   not was blood products.
   EMERGENCY CONTACT: Daughter (and HCP) [**Name (NI) 5324**]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5325**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented with a new episode of hematemesis and is currently in fair condition. He has a known allergy to drug allergies. The patient is a Jehovah Witness and does not want to receive blood products. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding and the presence of hematemesis suggest ongoing bleeding. It is important to identify the source of the bleeding and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) is 33-34, but there may have been acute blood loss due to the bleeding episode. The anemia could worsen if the patient continues to bleed or if he refuses blood transfusions due to his religious beliefs.
3. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia: These conditions are likely related to myelosuppression secondary to metastatic prostate cancer. Close monitoring of these values is necessary to detect any further decline.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which needs to be managed appropriately. Holding certain medications and monitoring the patient's response to treatment is important.
5. Metastatic prostate cancer: The patient has ongoing management for his metastatic prostate cancer, including outpatient follow-up and medication for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old man with Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer and
   history of GI bleeding, presenting with new episode of hematemesis, in
   fair condition.
   # Hematemesis: Likely due to an ulcer versus radiation esophagitis
   versus a variceal bleed. Given the pt's history of GE jxn bleeding in
   the past, suspect another lesion at this site to be the source of the
   bleeding. Per the patient's HCP and daughter [**Name (NI) 5324**], the pt is Jehovah
   Witness and would not want blood products.
   - Confirm JW status with patient
   - PPI gtt per GI recs
   - D/w GI octreotide
   - Maintain two 18 gauge antecubital IVs
   - Telemetry to monitor tachycardia
   - Surgery aware of patient, if stable o/n will see in am
   # Anemia: The pt's baseline hct is 33-34, but the pt may have had acute
   blood loss secondary to bleed which may not be reflected in the CBC.
   There may also be a component of ACD secondary to malignancy.
   - Trend hct q8h
   - See above treatment plan for evaluation of likely source of bleeding
   # Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia: Likely myelosuppression secondary to
   metastatic prostate cancer, but counts are at the pt's recent baseline
   (since 5/[**2160**]).
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypertension: Hold home regimen (toprol, lasix) in order to follow
   tachycardia. Hold lisinopril as the pt may develop hypotension in the
   setting of bleeding.
   - Restart lisinopril, metoprolol, lasix as the pt stabilizes.
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: Currently s/p XRT to spine.
   - Outpatient f/u
   - Management per primary oncologist
   - Continue BPH meds
   # Depression: Continue home celexa and trazodone.
   # Hepatitis C: Not active currently. Unclear if pt has a physician who
   manages his Hep C.
   - Outpatient follow up.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Not anticoagulated.
   - Given GI bleed agree with plan no to start anticoagulation.
   FEN: NPO for now until GI clearance
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen per home regimen
   -Pain management with tylenol per home regimen
   ACCESS: PIV's
   CODE STATUS: full; however per daughter pt is Jehovah Witness and does
   not was blood products.
   EMERGENCY CONTACT: Daughter (and HCP) [**Name (NI) 5324**]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5325**].

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer, and a previous gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He presented with a new episode of hematemesis and is currently in fair condition.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions and is receiving treatment for them. These conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient likely has an ulcer, radiation esophagitis, or variceal bleeding as the source of his current hematemesis. Given his history of GI bleeding, it is suspected that another lesion at the same site may be causing the bleeding.

2. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) level is 33-34, but there may be acute blood loss due to the bleeding, which is not reflected in the current CBC. There may also be a component of anemia of chronic disease (ACD) secondary to malignancy.

3. Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia: These are likely due to myelosuppression secondary to metastatic prostate cancer, but the counts are at the patient's recent baseline.

4. Hypertension: The patient's home regimen of toprol, lasix, and lisinopril needs to be held for now due to tachycardia. Lisinopril should be restarted when the patient stabilizes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a chief complaint of hematemesis. He has multiple comorbidities including hepatitis C, diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, pancytopenia, and metastatic prostate cancer. The patient is a Jehovah's Witness and refuses blood products. He presented to the ICU with ongoing hematemesis and a non-clearing NGT lavage. His hemoglobin level is 31.

24-hour events include an endoscopy that revealed blood in the stomach with a clot at the gastroesophageal junction, as well as active bleeding at the cardia. Epinephrine was injected to achieve hemostasis. The patient remains NPO and is receiving maintenance fluids. His vital signs are stable, but he has a history of fatigue, anemia, and no pain. 

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a slight increase in blood pressure. Fluid balance is positive due to IVF. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and has an ABG showing pH 7.26. Physical examination reveals a thin appearance, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurologic examination is not fully assessed.

Lab results show low white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. ECG shows nonspecific changes. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding has been controlled with"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented with a new episode of hematemesis and is currently in fair condition. The patient has a documented history of Jehovah's Witness beliefs, indicating he would not want to receive blood products. The patient's current vital signs show hypertension, and his hemoglobin levels have been trending downward, likely due to acute blood loss from the bleeding episode. The source of bleeding is suspected to be either an ulcer or variceal bleed. The patient's leukocyte and platelet counts are low, likely due to myelosuppression from chemotherapy. Other medical conditions include hypertension, depression, atrial fibrillation, and metastatic prostate cancer. The patient is currently being managed with proton pump inhibitors, telemetry monitoring, and plans for endoscopic evaluation to determine the source of bleeding. The patient is also being closely monitored for anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old man with Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer and
   history of GI bleeding, presenting with new episode of hematemesis, in
   fair condition.
   # Hematemesis: Likely due to ulcer seen on re-scope. Hct stable now
   x24h.
   - Confirmed JW status with patient
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **] per GI recs
   - Maintain two 18 gauge antecubital IVs
   - Telemetry to monitor tachycardia
   - surgery following
   # Anemia: Stable ~25 for 24h.
   - Trend hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - See above treatment plan for likely source of bleeding
   # Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia: Likely myelosuppression secondary to
   metastatic prostate cancer, but counts are at the pt's recent baseline
   (since 5/[**2160**]).
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypertension: Hold home regimen (toprol, lasix) in order to follow
   tachycardia. Hold lisinopril as the pt may develop hypotension in the
   setting of bleeding.
   - Restart lisinopril, metoprolol, lasix as the pt stabilizes.
   # CAD: Hold aspirin.
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: Currently s/p XRT to spine.
   - Outpatient f/u
   - Management per primary oncologist
   - Continue BPH meds
   # Depression: Continue home celexa and trazodone.
   # Hepatitis C: Not active currently. Unclear if pt has a physician who
   manages his Hep C.
   - Outpatient follow up.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Not anticoagulated.
   - Given GI bleed agree with plan no to start anticoagulation.
   FEN: NPO for now until GI clearance
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen per home regimen
   -Pain management with tylenol per home regimen

","The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented with a new episode of hematemesis and is currently in fair condition. The patient has undergone an endoscopy which revealed an ulcer at the cardia, a clot or nodule at the squamocolumnar junction, and esophagitis. The findings are compatible with esophagitis, and the ulcer may be the likely source of bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/63 to 180/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on telemetry to monitor for tachycardia and has two 18-gauge antecubital IVs.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL, platelet count of 93 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 106 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

   86 year old man with Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer and
   history of GI bleeding, presenting with new episode of hematemesis, in
   fair condition.
   # Hematemesis: Likely due to an ulcer versus radiation esophagitis
   versus a variceal bleed. Given the pt's history of GE jxn bleeding in
   the past, suspect another lesion at this site to be the source of the
   bleeding. Per the patient's HCP and daughter [**Name (NI) 5324**], the pt is Jehovah
   Witness and would not want [**Name (NI) 1056**] products.
   - Confirmed JW status with patient
   - PPI gtt per GI recs
   - Maintain two 18 gauge antecubital IVs
   - Telemetry to monitor tachycardia
   - surgery following
   - plan for re-scope per GI at 2:30p
   # Anemia: The pt's baseline hct is 33-34, but the pt may have had acute
   [**Name (NI) 1056**] loss secondary to bleed which may not be reflected in the CBC.
   There may also be a component of ACD secondary to malignancy.
   - Trend hct q8h
   - See above treatment plan for evaluation of likely source of bleeding
   # Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia: Likely myelosuppression secondary to
   metastatic prostate cancer, but counts are at the pt's recent baseline
   (since 5/[**2160**]).
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypertension: Hold home regimen (toprol, lasix) in order to follow
   tachycardia. Hold lisinopril as the pt may develop hypotension in the
   setting of bleeding.
   - Restart lisinopril, metoprolol, lasix as the pt stabilizes.
   # CAD: Hold aspirin.
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: Currently s/p XRT to spine.
   - Outpatient f/u
   - Management per primary oncologist
   - Continue BPH meds
   # Depression: Continue home celexa and trazodone.
   # Hepatitis C: Not active currently. Unclear if pt has a physician who
   manages his Hep C.
   - Outpatient follow up.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Not anticoagulated.
   - Given GI bleed agree with plan no to start anticoagulation.
   FEN: NPO for now until GI clearance
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen per home regimen
   -Pain management with tylenol per home regimen
   ACCESS: PIV's
   CODE STATUS: full; however per daughter pt is Jehovah Witness and does
   not want [**Year (4 digits) 1056**] products.
   EMERGENCY CONTACT: Daughter (and HCP) [**Name (NI) 5324**]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5325**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with a new episode of hematemesis and is currently in fair condition. The patient is a Jehovah's Witness and does not want blood transfusions. He has been started on pantoprazole (PPI) and carafate slurry as recommended by the GI specialist. An endoscopy was performed, revealing an esophageal nodule, esophageal ulcer, and erythema, erosion, and congestion at the gastroesophageal junction consistent with esophagitis. The source of bleeding is likely an ulcer or radiation esophagitis, with a possibility of a variceal bleed. The patient's baseline hemoglobin concentration is 33-34%, but there may have been acute blood loss secondary to the bleed that is not reflected in the CBC. There is also a component of anemia of chronic disease (ACD) secondary to malignancy. The patient's white blood cell count and platelet count are at his recent baseline since 5/ [**2160**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding from the esophageal ulcer or varices.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his compromised immune system from malignancy and cirrhosis.
3. Hepatic enceph"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's hemodynamic status remained stable overnight, with a drop in hematocrit (Hct) to 20 but later confirmed to be spurious at 25. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with mild hypertension. The patient is currently comfortable in bed at a 20-degree elevation, and chest pain was noted. The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs, last dose of antibiotics, midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole infusions. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for fatigue, constipation, anemia, and no reported pain. The patient has been receiving nutritional support through nasogastric (NG) tube and is currently on a clear diet. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 4,191 mL and output of 1,900 mL, with a total balance of 2,291 mL. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with normal blood gas values. The patient's physical examination reveals normal vital signs, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and soft, non-tender abdomen. Neurological assessment is pending due to the patient's critical condition. Lab results show low platelet count and slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, while other lab values are within normal limits"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old man with Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer and
   history of GI bleeding, presenting with new episode of hematemesis, in
   fair condition.
   # Hematemesis: Likely due to ulcer seen on re-scope. Hct stable
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **] per GI recs
   - Maintain two 18g PIVs BUT NO BLOOD
   - Telemetry to monitor tachycardia
   - surgery, GI, IR following
   - plan for urgent scope by GI if rebleeds as surgery not good option
   given JW.
   # Parkinsons: Acute flair yest likely in setting of holding meds for
   NPO, discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5393**] and Neuro.
   - given benztropine for ? dystonic reaction with mild improvement but
   may have been improving anyway.
   # Anemia: Stable ~25 (20 likely lab error). Due to bleeding
   - Trend hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - See above treatment plan for likely source of bleeding
   # Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia: Likely myelosuppression secondary to
   metastatic prostate cancer, but counts are at the pt's recent baseline
   (since 5/[**2160**]).
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypertension: Hold home regimen (toprol, lasix, lisinopril) in order
   to follow tachycardia.
   - Restart lisinopril, metoprolol, lasix as the pt stabilizes.
   # CAD: Hold aspirin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of Hep C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented with a new episode of hematemesis and is currently in fair condition. The patient has been diagnosed with an esophageal nodule, esophageal ulcer, and esophagitis. He also has Parkinson's disease and is experiencing acute worsening of his symptoms. The patient's blood counts show anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, which are likely due to myelosuppression secondary to metastatic prostate cancer. He has hypertension and a history of atrial fibrillation but is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient is also being treated for depression and hepatitis C.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and presents with hematemesis. There is a risk of rebleeding, especially if the underlying cause is not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to metastatic prostate cancer increases the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, such as DVT.
4. Hypotension: The patient's history of cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding may predispose him to hypotension, especially if there is ongoing bleeding"

","The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, metastatic prostate cancer, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented with a new episode of hematemesis and is currently in fair condition. The patient has multiple medical complications, including Parkinson's disease, anemia, fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, depression, hepatitis C, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's recent events include worsening of Parkinson's symptoms, development of rigidity, and mild improvement after administration of cogentin. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, for which an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. The EGD revealed an esophageal nodule, esophageal ulcer, erythema, erosion, and congestion in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with esophagitis. The differential diagnosis includes pill esophagitis, peptic esophagitis, and neoplasm or metastatic prostate cancer.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 170/84 to 174/135 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His blood glucose levels are within normal range.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.6-3.1 thousand"
