","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and recently diagnosed atrial flutter. He presented from outside hospital with pericardial effusion, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient has been in the ICU since then. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a bloody effusion suggestive of malignancy. However, it may be due to anticoagulation in the setting of possible uremic pericarditis. Further follow-up is needed, including cytology and other studies. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma should be given if bleeding increases. Monitoring of drain output and following the protocol are also necessary. Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) once drain output stops.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, and his right atrium (RA) thrombus is a contraindication to cardioversion. Digoxin, Cardizem, and Metoprolol should be continued. Anticoagulation should be held for now due to the high risk of bleeding.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has a suggestion of multifocal pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) dated [**1-9**]. He was transferred on Imipenem and Levofloxacin. Since the patient was intubated for 10 days, he may have hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), but sputum cultures from the outside hospital taken on [**1-4**] were negative. Oxygen should be weaned as tolerated, Zosyn should be given for an 8-day course from [**1-10**], and sputum culture and sensitivity should be done once the mechanical ventilation (MV) is cleared.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had altered mental status since extubation. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed metabolic encephalopathy. An urgent head CT was ordered, which did not demonstrate evidence of an acute intracranial process. A small stroke would not likely cause this degree of encephalopathy. Further follow-up with the head CT final read and neurologic culture and sensitivity for persistently garbled speech and nonlinear thought process is needed.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine increased from his baseline of 0.5 to 2.6 at the outside hospital in the setting of extensive diuresis. This appears to have improved here, but fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) on admission is still 0.5%, and the patient has some evidence of hypernatremia consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia. Trend creatinine and hold intravenous fluids (IVFs) for now. The patient will receive 250cc free water flushes every 4 hours with tube feed.
6. Hematuria: The patient was found to have hem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged man who was admitted to the ICU due to severe sepsis. On the previous day, he became agitated and attempted to remove his central venous catheter. He received Zyprexa to manage his agitation but required restraints overnight. His vital signs show elevated blood pressure, normal heart rate, slightly elevated respiratory rate, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is atrial flutter with a total intake of 469 mL of fluids and output of 1650 mL. The patient has received piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for antibiotics. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, distant heart sounds with elevated jugular venous distention, bilateral expiratory rales, and positive blood pressure pulses.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Agitation and Restraints: The patient's agitation and need for restraints indicate possible delirium or ICU psychosis. This can increase the risk of falls, injuries, and stress on the patient.

2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter, which is an abnormal heart rate. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as"

   70 yo man with h/o HTN and recently diagnosed AFlutter who presented
   from OSH with pericardial effusion, AMS, and ARF.
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion s/p drain:  Bloody effusion generally
   suggestive of malignancy.  However, this effusion may be a result of
   anticoagulation in the setting of uremic pericarditis.
   - f/u cytology, other studies
   - Vitamin K and FFP if bleeding increasing
   - monitor drain output
   - repeat TTE once drain output stopped
   .
   #. Atrial Flutter: His RA thrombus is a contraindication to
   cardioversion.
   - Continue Digoxin, Cardizem, and Metoprolol
   - hold anticoagulaiton
   .
   # RA thrombus: Per family, the finding was questionable.  It was not
   documented in the transfer notes.  It was seen on [**1-6**] and he started
   coumadin on [**12-23**].  Since he had not been on coumadin for long enough to
   resolve a clot, I would not consider this a treatment failure.
   - clarify history with [**Hospital 4705**] Hospital, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10213**]
   - no anticoagulation as bleeding risk is greater
   .
   #. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a multifocal PNA
   on CT dated [**1-9**]. He was transferred on Imipenem and Levofloxacin.
   Given the fact that the patient was intubated for 10 days, he likely
   has HAP.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - Vancomycin/Zosyn/Cipro for 10 day course from [**1-10**]
   - unclear why on fluconazole, will attemt to clarify with [**Last Name (un) 4705**] H and
   d/c otherwise
   - S&S C/S once MS cleared
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had AMS since extubation. EEG
   was c/w metabolic encephalopathy.  An urgent head CT was ordered.  A
   small stroke would not likely cause this degree of encephalopathy.
   - f/u head CT final read.
   - Consider Neuro C/S if not resolving
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine increased at the OSH
   from his baseline of 0.5 to 2.6, in the setting of extensive diuresis.
   This appears to have improved here.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Send urine electrolytes
   - Hold on IVFs for now
   .
   #. Hematauria: The patient was found to have hematuria at OSH, and
   there was concern for bladder cancer, given his history of smoking.
   Urology was consulted and recommended an outpatient cystoscopy.
   - F/U with Urology as an outpatient.
   .
   #. Anemia: The patient's hct has dropped on this admission from 43 to
   26.6.  Bleeding into pericardium and urine.  He was reportedly guaiaic
   negative at OSH.  B12, folate normal.  Fe studies showed 19%
   saturation, Fe 43, and [**Last Name (un) **] 1190 c/w ongoing inflammation and possible
   mild Fe deficiency.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - trend Hct, transfuse to 21 or significant bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and recently diagnosed atrial flutter.
- He presented from the operating room (OSH) with pericardial effusion, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient had a bloody pericardial effusion suggestive of malignancy, but it may be due to anticoagulation in the setting of uremic pericarditis.
- He has a right atrial thrombus, which is a contraindication to cardioversion.
- The patient has multifocal pneumonia and was intubated for 10 days, likely leading to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- He also has altered mental status since extubation, with an EEG showing metabolic encephalopathy.
- The patient's creatinine levels increased from 0.5 to 2.6 at OSH, indicating acute renal failure.
- He has hematuria, which was initially thought to be related to bladder cancer, but further evaluation is needed.
- The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 43 to 26.6 due to bleeding into the pericardium and urine.
- The patient is currently in the ICU receiving tube feeds, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and has multiple lines including an arterial line.

   # RA thrombus: Per family, the finding was questionable.  It was not
   documented in the transfer notes.  It was seen on [**1-6**] and he started
   coumadin on [**12-23**].  Since he had not been on coumadin for long enough to
   resolve a clot, I would not consider this a treatment failure. His

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and recently diagnosed atrial flutter.
- He presented from OSH with pericardial effusion, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient has a bloody pericardial effusion, which may suggest malignancy but could also be due to anticoagulation-related uremic pericarditis.
- He is currently in 2-point restraints and receiving oxygen through a facemask.
- The patient has a history of smoking and was found to have hematuria at OSH, raising concerns about bladder cancer. Urology consultation recommended an outpatient cystoscopy.
- His Hct has dropped from 43 to 26.6 due to bleeding into the pericardium and urine. Iron studies showed ongoing inflammation and possible mild iron deficiency.
- The patient has multifocal pneumonia, for which he was already started on Imipenem and Levofloxacin. Sputum cultures from OSH were negative.
- He had an urgent head CT that did not demonstrate any acute intracranial process. An EEG confirmed metabolic encephalopathy.
- The patient's creatinine increased from 0.5 to 2.6 at OSH and appears to have improved but may still require further monitoring.
- He is currently receiving tube feeds with free water flushes and has an arterial line, central line, and peripheral line.
- Anticoagulation is being held due to the high bleeding risk, and the patient is on prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.
- His current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Pericardial effusion and possible malignancy: The patient has a bloody pericardial effusion, which may suggest malignancy. Further investigation and follow-up are needed.
2. Uremic pericarditis: The patient's anticoagulation in the setting of ARF may contribute to uremic pericarditis. Monitoring and management of this condition are necessary.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of recently diagnosed atrial flutter. Continuing medications such as Digoxin, Cardizem, and Metoprolol is essential. Holding anticoagulation may also be considered.
4. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are required.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has had AMS since extubation, and an EEG confirmed metabolic encephalopathy. Further evaluation, including a head CT, is needed to determine the cause.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have significantly increased. Trending creatinine levels and managing fluid balance are important in this case.
7. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, and there is concern for bladder cancer. A cystoscopy has been recommended, and follow-up with urology is necessary.
8. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped significantly. Monitoring hemoglobin levels, transfusing as needed, and addressing possible iron deficiency are important.

These are potential medical complications based on the provided information."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo man with h/o HTN and recently diagnosed AFlutter who presented
   from OSH with pericardial effusion, AMS, and ARF.
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion s/p [**Month/Year (2) **]:  Bloody effusion generally
   suggestive of malignancy.  However, this effusion may be a result of
   anticoagulation in the setting of possible uremic pericarditis.
   - f/u Cytology, other studies
   - Repeat TTE today
   - Pull pericardial [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] protocol
   - Vitamin K and FFP if bleeding increasing
   .
   #. Atrial Flutter w/ RA thrombus: His RA thrombus is a contraindication
   to cardioversion.  Finding of thrombus was questionable, will discuss
   with [**Hospital3 735**] provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 10213**] today, but given concern
   for stroke, suspicion is high for thrombus.
   - Continue Digoxin, Cardizem, and Metoprolol
   - Hold anticoagulation for now
   - F/U with [**Hospital3 735**] provider
   .
   #. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a suggestion of
   multifocal PNA on CT dated [**1-9**]. He was transferred on Imipenem and
   Levofloxacin. Given the fact that the patient was intubated for 10
   days, he may have a HAP, but sputum cultures from OSH taken on [**1-4**]
   were negative. Patient spiked to 101.6 yesterday evening, blood
   cultures, U/A resent. Concern for pneumonitis given malposition of
   G-tube.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - F/U CXR
   - Continue Zosyn for 8 day course from [**1-10**], can extend coverage if no
   clinical improvement
   - S&S C/S once MS cleared
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had AMS since extubation. EEG
   was c/w metabolic encephalopathy, but common metabolic causes ruled out
   (normal folate/B12). An urgent head CT was ordered that did not
   demonstrate e/o of an acute intracranial process. Neurology was
   consulted and was concerned for CVA. Carotid U/S demonstrated <40%
   stenosis on L and 40-60% on R. Recommended MRI, but patient will not
   tolerate MRI without sedation.
   - F/U Neuro recs
   - PT/OT consult
   - Begin anticoagulation per Neuro with Coumadin if TTE demonstrates no
   reaccumulation of effusion
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Patient with Na 157 up from 155 yesterday, 143 on
   admission. Urine Osm
s, electrolytes, support a hypovolemic
   hyponatremia. Free H2O deficit increased to 6.7L this AM.  Despite
   increasing his free water flushes, remains elevated. To avoid rapid
   re-correction, goal should be no greater than 12 mEq/L over the next 24
   hours & no more than 50% of his free water deficit over the next 24
   hours.
   - Continue free water flushes at 250cc q2H

   #. Acute renal failure: Resolved. The patient's creatinine increased at
   the OSH from his baseline of 0.5 to 2.6, in the setting of extensive
   diuresis.  Cr normalized to 0.9 today.
   - Trend Creatinine
   .
   #. Hematuria: The patient was found to have hematuria at OSH, and there
   was concern for bladder cancer, given his history of smoking. Urology
   was consulted and recommended an outpatient cystoscopy.  Hematuria
   improved since anticoagulation held. Will f/u with Urology as an
   outpatient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and recently diagnosed atrial flutter. He presented from OSH with pericardial effusion, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient has been in the ICU since then and has had multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient initially had a bloody pericardial effusion, which is generally suggestive of malignancy. However, it may be a result of anticoagulation in the setting of possible uremic pericarditis. Cytology and other studies are pending, and a repeat TTE has been ordered. The pericardial effusion has since resolved.

2. Atrial Flutter with RA Thrombus: The patient has atrial flutter with a right atrial thrombus, which is a contraindication to cardioversion. The presence of a thrombus was questionable, and it will be discussed further with the hospital provider. The patient is currently on digoxin, Cardizem, and metoprolol. Anticoagulation has been held for now.

3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has been found to have multifocal pneumonia on CT dated 1/9. He was transferred on imipenem and levofloxacin. Given the fact that the patient was intubated for 10 days, he may have hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP"

   #. Pericardial effusion s/p [**Month/Year (2) **]:  Bloody effusion generally
   suggestive of malignancy.  However, this effusion may be a result of
   anticoagulation in the setting of possible uremic pericarditis.
   - f/u Cytology, other studies
   - Repeat TTE today
   - Pull pericardial [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] protocol
   - Vitamin K and FFP if bleeding increasing
   .
   #. Atrial Flutter w/ RA thrombus: His RA thrombus is a contraindication
   to cardioversion.  Finding of thrombus was questionable, will discuss
   with [**Hospital3 735**] provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 10213**] today, but given concern
   for stroke, suspicion is high for thrombus.
   - Continue Digoxin, Cardizem, and Metoprolol
   - Hold anticoagulation for now
   - F/U with [**Hospital3 735**] provider
   .
   #. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a suggestion of
   multifocal PNA on CT dated [**1-9**]. He was transferred on Imipenem and
   Levofloxacin. Given the fact that the patient was intubated for 10
   days, he may have a HAP, but sputum cultures from OSH taken on [**1-4**]
   were negative. Patient spiked to 101.6 yesterday evening, blood
   cultures, U/A resent. Concern for pneumonitis given malposition of
   G-tube.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - F/U CXR
   - Consider expanding coverage given fever, respiratory distress
   - Zosyn for 8 day course from [**1-10**]
   - S&S C/S once MS cleared
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had AMS since extubation. EEG
   was c/w metabolic encephalopathy, but common metabolic causes ruled out
   (normal folate/B12). An urgent head CT was ordered that did not
   demonstrate e/o of an acute intracranial process. Neurology was
   consulted and was concerned for CVA. Carotid U/S demonstrated <40%
   stenosis on L and 40-60% on R. Recommended MRI, but patient will not
   tolerate MRI without sedation.

s, electrolytes, support a hypovolemic
   hyponatremia. Free H2O deficit increased to 6.7L this AM.  Despite
   increasing his free water flushes, remains elevated. To avoid rapid
   re-correction, goal should be no greater than 12 mEq/L over the next 24
   hours & no more than 50% of his free water deficit over the next 24
   hours.
   - Continue free water flushes at 250cc q2H
s, for total free water
   repletion of 3L over the next 24 hours
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Resolved. The patient's creatinine increased at
   the OSH from his baseline of 0.5 to 2.6, in the setting of extensive
   diuresis.  Cr normalized to 0.9 today.
   - Trend Creatinine
   .
   #. Hematuria: The patient was found to have hematuria at OSH, and there
   was concern for bladder cancer, given his history of smoking. Urology
   was consulted and recommended an outpatient cystoscopy.  Hematuria
   improved since anticoagulation held. Will f/u with Urology as an
   outpatient.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial flutter. He presented to the emergency department with pericardial effusion, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient underwent a pericardial drain, and his pericardial effusion has resolved. He continues to have altered mental status, and an EEG showed metabolic encephalopathy. Common metabolic causes have been ruled out, and an urgent head CT did not demonstrate any acute intracranial process. Neurology was consulted and concerned for a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), with carotid ultrasound demonstrating less than 40% stenosis on the left and 40-60% stenosis on the right. An MRI was recommended but the patient will not tolerate it without sedation.

The patient also has multifocal pneumonia, and sputum cultures from the previous hospital were negative. He was started on imipenem and levofloxacin. The patient's sodium level is elevated at 157, and free water deficit has increased to 6.7L. His urine osmolarity and electrolytes support hypovolemic hyponatremia. The goal is to correct the sodium level slowly over the next 24 hours, with no more than a 12 mEq/L change and no more than 50% of his free water deficit over the next 24 hours.

Other findings include resolved acute renal failure"

   (normal folate/B12). An urgent head CT was ordered that did not
   demonstrate e/o of an acute intracranial process. Neurology was
   consulted and was concerned for CVA. Carotid U/S demonstrated <40%
   stenosis on L and 40-60% on R. Recommended MRI, but patient will not

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and recently diagnosed atrial flutter. He presented from OSH with pericardial effusion, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and had a bloody effusion suggestive of malignancy, but it may also be due to anticoagulation in the setting of possible uremic pericarditis. The patient's pericardial effusion has resolved.

The patient has multifocal pneumonia and was started on imipenem and levofloxacin. He is intubated and has been for 10 days, which raises concerns for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). However, sputum cultures from OSH were negative.

The patient has altered mental status since extubation, and an urgent head CT did not show any evidence of an acute intracranial process. Neurology is concerned for cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and carotid ultrasound demonstrated less than 40% stenosis on the left and 40-60% stenosis on the right. An MRI was recommended, but the patient will not tolerate it without sedation.

The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 157, up from 155 yesterday. His free water deficit has been increased to 6.7L this AM. Despite increasing his free water flushes, his sodium remains elevated. The"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recently diagnosed atrial flutter. He presented from OSH with pericardial effusion, altered mental status, and acute renal failure.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions and treatments. The medical team has identified several potential complications that need to be addressed:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient had a bloody pericardial effusion, which is generally suggestive of malignancy.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo man with h/o HTN and recently diagnosed AFlutter who presented
   from OSH with pericardial effusion, AMS, and ARF.
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion s/p [**Telephone/Fax (3) **]:  Bloody effusion generally
   suggestive of malignancy.  However, this effusion may be a result of
   anticoagulation in the setting of possible uremic pericarditis.
   - f/u Cytology, other studies
   - Repeat TTE today
   - Pull pericardial [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] protocol
   - Vitamin K and FFP if bleeding increasing
   .
   #. Atrial Flutter w/ RA thrombus: His RA thrombus is a contraindication
   to cardioversion.  Finding of thrombus was questionable, will discuss
   with [**Hospital3 735**] provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 10213**] today, but given concern
   for stroke, suspicion is high for thrombus.
   - Continue Digoxin, Cardizem, and Metoprolol
   - Hold anticoagulation for now
   - F/U with [**Hospital3 735**] provider
   .
   #. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a suggestion of
   multifocal PNA on CT dated [**1-9**]. He was transferred on Imipenem and
   Levofloxacin. Given the fact that the patient was intubated for 10
   days, he may have a HAP, but sputum cultures from OSH taken on [**1-4**]
   were negative. Patient spiked to 101.6 yesterday evening, blood
   cultures, U/A resent. Concern for pneumonitis given malposition of
   G-tube.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - F/U CXR
   - Continue Zosyn for 8 day course from [**1-10**], can extend coverage if no
   clinical improvement
   - S&S C/S once MS cleared
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had AMS since extubation. EEG
   was c/w metabolic encephalopathy, but common metabolic causes ruled out
   (normal folate/B12). An urgent head CT was ordered that did not
   demonstrate e/o of an acute intracranial process. Neurology was
   consulted and was concerned for CVA. Carotid U/S demonstrated <40%
   stenosis on L and 40-60% on R. Recommended MRI, but patient will not
   tolerate MRI without sedation.
   - F/U Neuro recs
   - PT/OT consult
   - Begin anticoagulation per Neuro with Coumadin if TTE demonstrates no
   reaccumulation of effusion
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Patient with Na 157 up from 155 yesterday, 143 on
   admission. Urine Osm
s, electrolytes, support a hypovolemic
   hyponatremia. Free H2O deficit increased to 6.7L this AM.  Despite
   increasing his free water flushes, remains elevated. To avoid rapid
   re-correction, goal should be no greater than 12 mEq/L over the next 24
   hours & no more than 50% of his free water deficit over the next 24
   hours.
   - Continue free water flushes at 250cc q2H
s, for total free water
   repletion of 3L over the next 24 hours
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Resolved. The patient's creatinine increased at
   the OSH from his baseline of 0.5 to 2.6, in the setting of extensive
   diuresis.  Cr normalized to 0.9 today.
   - Trend Creatinine
   .
   #. Hematuria: The patient was found to have hematuria at OSH, and there
   was concern for bladder cancer, given his history of smoking. Urology
   was consulted and recommended an outpatient cystoscopy.  Hematuria
   improved since anticoagulation held. Will f/u with Urology as an
   outpatient.
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct 27.7 today, stable since admission.  Guaiac negative at
   OSH.  B12, folate normal.  Fe studies showed 19% saturation, Fe 43, and
   [**Last Name (un) **] 1190 c/w ongoing inflammation and possible mild Fe deficiency.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend Hct, transfuse to 21 or significant bleeding.
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recently diagnosed atrial flutter. He presented from the outside hospital (OSH) with pericardial effusion, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF).

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient had a bloody effusion suggestive of malignancy, but it may also be due to anticoagulation in the setting of possible uremic pericarditis. Further follow-up, including cytology and other studies, is needed.

2. Atrial Flutter with RA thrombus: The patient has a contraindication to cardioversion due to the presence of a right atrial thrombus. There is a high suspicion for stroke, so continuing digoxin, Cardizem, and metoprolol is recommended. Holding anticoagulation for now and discussing with the hospital provider are also advised.

3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has a suggestion of multifocal pneumonia on CT, and he was transferred on imipenem and levofloxacin. Given the prolonged intubation period, there is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Blood cultures and urinalysis were recently done. Weaning oxygen as tolerated, following up with a chest X-ray, and extending coverage if no clinical improvement are recommended."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and recently diagnosed atrial flutter. He presented from OSH with pericardial effusion, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient was found to have a suggestion of multifocal pneumonia on CT and was transferred on Imipenem and Levofloxacin. He has also been intubated for 10 days, which raises concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The sputum cultures from OSH were negative, but blood cultures were sent due to a fever spike. Urine culture is negative.

The patient has altered mental status since extubation, and an urgent head CT did not demonstrate any evidence of an acute intracranial process. Neurology was consulted and concerned for CVA (cerebrovascular accident). Carotid U/S showed <40% stenosis on the left and 40-60% on the right. An MRI was recommended but the patient will not tolerate it without sedation. Neurology is recommending anticoagulation, speech therapy, and outpatient follow-up.

The patient had a pericardial effusion that was drained, which was bloody but cytology negative for malignant cells. The repeat TTE showed no reaccumulation of the effusion, so the drain was pulled. There is also a concern for atrial flutter with RA (right atrium) thrombus, contraindic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and recently diagnosed atrial flutter. He presented from the outside hospital with pericardial effusion, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient underwent pericardial drain and was started on heparin, bridged to coumadin. He has been on a ventilator for 10 days, which may have caused hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's temperature is mildly elevated, and there is concern for pneumonitis due to the malposition of his G-tube. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions consistent with overload but no obvious consolidation. The patient's blood cultures were sent, and urine culture was negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a suggestion of multifocal pneumonia on CT. He was transferred on Imipenem and Levofloxacin. Given the fact that the patient was intubated for 10 days, he may have HAP, but sputum cultures from OSH taken on [**1-4**] were negative. The patient spiked to 101.6 yesterday evening, blood cultures sent. Urine culture negative. Concern for pneumonitis given malposition of G-tube. CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions consistent with overload, but no obvious consolidation. Patient has not spiked since then, but temperatures and WBC remain mildly elevated.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Continue Zosyn for 8-day course from [**1-10**], last day [**1-17**]
   - S&S consulted, recommending NPO with TF

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had altered mental status since extubation. EEG was c/w metabolic encephalopathy, but common metabolic causes ruled out (normal folate/B12). An urgent head CT was ordered that did not demonstrate e/o of an acute intracranial process. Neurology was consulted and was concerned for CVA. Carotid U/S demonstrated <40% stenosis on L and 40-60% on R. Recommended MRI, but the patient will not tolerate MRI without sedation. Neuro recommending anticoagulation, speech therapy, outpatient follow-up.
   - Continue PT/OT
   - Continue Coumadin 5mg PO qHS
   - As pressures escalate with agitation, increase Amlodipine from 5 to 10mg PO daily

3. Pericardial effusion s/p drain: Bloody effusion generally suggestive of malignancy. However, this effusion may be a result of anticoagulation in the setting of possible uremic pericarditis. Repeat TTE demonstrated no reaccumulation of the effusion, so drain pulled. Cytology negative for malignant cells.
   - Percardial fluid negative for growth to"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo man with h/o HTN and recently diagnosed AFlutter who presented
   from OSH with pericardial effusion, AMS, and ARF.
   .
   #. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a suggestion of
   multifocal PNA on CT dated [**1-9**]. He was transferred on Imipenem and
   Levofloxacin. Given the fact that the patient was intubated for 10
   days, he may have a HAP, but sputum cultures from OSH taken on [**1-4**]
   were negative. Patient spiked to 101.6 yesterday evening, blood
   cultures sent. Urine culture negative. Concern for pneumonitis given
   malposition of G-tube. CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions
   consistent with overload, but no obvious consolidation. Patient has not
   spiked since then, but temperatures and WBC remain mildly elevated.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Continue Zosyn for 8 day course from [**1-10**], last day [**1-17**]
   - S&S consulted, recommending NPO with TF
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had AMS since extubation. EEG
   was c/w metabolic encephalopathy, but common metabolic causes ruled out
   (normal folate/B12). An urgent head CT was ordered that did not
   demonstrate e/o of an acute intracranial process. Neurology was
   consulted and was concerned for CVA. Carotid U/S demonstrated <40%
   stenosis on L and 40-60% on R. Recommended MRI, but patient will not
   tolerate MRI without sedation.  Neuro recommending anticoagulation,
   speech therapy, outpatient follow-up.
   - Continue PT/OT
   - Continue Coumadin 5mg PO qHS
   - As pressures escalate with agitation, increase Amlodipine from 5 to
   10mg PO daily
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion s/p drain:  Bloody effusion generally
   suggestive of malignancy.  However, this effusion may be a result of
   anticoagulation in the setting of possible uremic pericarditis. Repeat
   TTE demonstrated no reaccumulation of the effusion, so drain pulled.
   Cytology negative for malignant cells.
   - Percardial fluid negative for growth to date, f/u final read.
   .
   #. Atrial Flutter w/ RA thrombus: His RA thrombus is a contraindication
   to cardioversion.  Finding of thrombus was questionable, will discuss
   with [**Hospital3 735**] provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 10213**] today, but given concern
   for stroke, suspicion is high for thrombus.
   - Continue Digoxin, Cardizem, and Metoprolol
   - Warfarin 5mg PO qHS
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Improved, patient with Na 152 down from 157 yesterday,
   143 on admission. Urine Osm
s, electrolytes, support a hypovolemic
   hyponatremia. Free H2O deficit increased to 4.7L this AM.
   - Continue free water flushes at 250cc q2H
s, for total free water
   repletion of 3L over the next 24 hours
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Resolved. The patient's creatinine increased at
   the OSH from his baseline of 0.5 to 2.6, in the setting of extensive
   diuresis.  Cr normalized to 0.7 today.
   .
   #. Hematuria: The patient was found to have hematuria at OSH, and there
   was concern for bladder cancer, given his history of smoking. Urology
   was consulted and recommended an outpatient cystoscopy.  Hematuria
   improved since anticoagulation held. Will f/u with Urology as an
   outpatient.
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable since admission.  Guaiac negative at OSH.  B12,
   folate normal.  Fe studies showed 19% saturation, Fe 43, and [**Last Name (un) **] 1190
   c/w ongoing inflammation and possible mild Fe deficiency.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend Hct, transfuse to 21 or significant bleeding.
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO daily
