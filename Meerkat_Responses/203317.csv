   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with
   trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit with hypotension and positive blood and sputum
   cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Resent sputum culture, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count
   (pending).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; keep femoral
   line for now but if CVL needed for few days can change to IJ/SC.
   - Consider non-infectious causes of hypotension (ROMI,
   bleed/hypovolemia).
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep lines in pending cx results, given chronic course of
   current illness.
   # Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, but
   with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - can check sputum cultures, but unclear if treatment warranted given
   lack of infiltrate.
   - cont home colistin.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 100.4 Axillary, workup as above
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR am of [**8-8**]
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - give low dose BB for now, being careful to avoid exacerbating
   hypotension.
   - received 3+ Liters NS boluses, with good response in BP, but HR
   continues to be 100-120
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - Recheck CD4
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Mefloquine

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient has a history of fever, airway issues, tachycardia, HIV, chronic anemia, and ethanol abuse. He is currently on various medications including HAART, atovaquone, mefloquine, acetaminophen, K+ SS, Mag SS, colistin, and metoclopramide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has positive blood cultures, indicating a bacterial infection. This could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs. This may require further investigation and treatment to maintain blood pressure within a normal range.
3. Pneumonia: Despite not showing clear evidence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray, the positive sputum cultures suggest the possibility of pneumonia, especially considering the patient's significant immunosuppression. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be continued.
4. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or even respiratory failure.
5. HIV-related opportunistic infections: Given the patient's advanced HIV/AIDS status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). He was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient has a history of multiple pulmonary infections with drug resistance, no recent CD4 count, and is at high risk for infection. He is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for gram-negative bacillus coverage. The patient also has chronic anemia that is macrocytic and likely related to HAART. He experienced a significant drop in hematocrit from 28.5 to 22.5 after receiving a blood transfusion. The patient's fever has been persistent, reaching up to 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and he has copious secretions in his tracheostomy. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and Zosyn. The patient's mental status is very poor, but not changed from baseline. He has a history of ethanol abuse and is now at a skilled nursing facility. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 99 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 100-120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 35% FiO2 via tracheostomy.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Resent sputum culture, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count
   (pending).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; keep femoral
   line for now but if CVL needed for few days can change to IJ/SC.
   - Consider non-infectious causes of hypotension (ROMI,
   bleed/hypovolemia).
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep lines in pending cx results, given chronic course of
   current illness.
   # Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, but
   with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - can check sputum cultures, but unclear if treatment warranted given
   lack of infiltrate.
   - cont home colistin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). The patient is currently admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, which may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. This could result in symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, decreased urine output, and changes in mental status.

2. Bacteremia: The positive blood cultures indicate the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, which can cause systemic infection. If left untreated, bacteremia can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ failure.

3. Pneumonia: Although the chest X-ray does not show clear evidence of pneumonia, the positive sputum cultures suggest the possibility of respiratory infection. Pneumonia can lead to increased respiratory distress, decreased oxygenation, and worsening of underlying lung conditions.

4. HIV/AIDS: As an immunocompromised patient with advanced HIV/AIDS, the patient is at high risk for opportunistic infections and complications. These may include tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus infection, pneumocystis pneumonia, and various fungal infections.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count (87 K/uL) indicates thrombocytopenia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Resent sputum culture, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count
   (pending).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; keep femoral
   line for now but if CVL needed for few days can change to IJ/SC.
   - Consider non-infectious causes of hypotension (ROMI,
   bleed/hypovolemia).
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep lines in pending cx results, given chronic course of
   current illness.
   # Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, but
   with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - can check sputum cultures, but unclear if treatment warranted given
   lack of infiltrate.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 as above
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - discussion with mother regarding goals of care
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR am of [**8-8**]
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - give low dose BB for now, being careful to avoid exacerbating
   hypotension.
   - received 3+ Liters NS boluses, with good response in BP, but HR
   continues to be 100-120
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - Recheck CD4
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Mefloquine
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother today
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Repeat hct 1500
   -          Further w/u following results
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy), and tracheostomy in place. The patient was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The patient has a history of advanced HIV but no recent CD4 count, indicating a high risk for infection. The patient also has an indwelling line of unclear duration. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for gram-negative bacterial coverage.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/53 mmHg to 109/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the mid-90s to 100's since admission. The cause of hypotension is unclear, but it may be due to sepsis or advanced HIV/AIDS.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures, suggesting bacteremia. He is being treated with vancomycin, and further cultures are pending.

3. Positive sputum cultures: Despite no"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; d/c femoral
   line today.
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - follow CXR
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - continue 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), and tracheostomy in place. He was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient's baseline blood pressure appears to be in the mid-90s, with one reading of 84/52 on 8/2. The patient has advanced HIV but no recent CD4 count available. He may be at high risk for infection due to an indwelling line and low immunity.

Assessment and Plan:
1. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure has been in the 90s to 100's since admission. He is being monitored, and blood cultures are pending. Vancomycin and Zosyn are being administered for GNR coverage. The patient's urine and sputum cultures showed no growth. C. diff tests were negative twice, and blood cultures are still pending. The patient may need further workup for sepsis based on CD4 count (53). Coverage for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is being considered since the patient has been on prophylaxis. A low yield lumbar puncture (LP) is being considered, but only if workup is negative. If the patient appears septic, goal-directed therapy with fluid boluses, pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP)"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - follow CXR
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - continue 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known PML. He was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient has advanced HIV but no recent CD4 count. He has an indwelling line of unclear duration. The patient's baseline blood pressure appears to be in the mid-90s, and he has been in the 90s to 100s since admission. He has been afebrile overnight, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's sputum showed no growth, and there is no evidence of infiltrate on CXR. Urine showed no growth as well. The patient's two C. diff tests were negative in the last week, so antibiotics will be discontinued today as he has been afebrile with no identifiable source. Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on the patient's CD4 count (53). Consideration will be given to workup/treatment coverage for PCP, but nothing is evident on the CXR, and oxygenation is good. The patient has been on prophylaxis. The patient's PICC line will be kept for now, and the decision will be readdressed following CX results. The patient was previously on 25 Metoprolol at the outside hospital, but the 100 mg QID listed by the previous hospital is a large increase. Metoprolol will be titrated down"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known PML. He was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient has advanced HIV but no recent CD4 count, putting him at high risk for infection. He also has an indwelling line of unclear time period.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 37.1°C (98.7°F), HR: 96 bpm (89-114 bpm), BP: 92/62 mmHg (69-111/35-77 mmHg), RR: 20 breaths/min (11-25 breaths/min), and SpO2: 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 4.2 K/uL, Hct of 25.5%, and Plt of 193 K/uL. His creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and his glucose level is 106 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's baseline BP appears to be mid-90s, but he had one BP reading of 84/52 on 8-2. He was sent to the ICU for low-grade temperatures (up to 100.8°F), but in the ED, his"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -          Continue to monitor Hct

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and currently admitted for hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. He has a history of advanced HIV but no recent CD4 count, putting him at high risk for infection. The patient has been afebrile overnight, and blood cultures are pending. Sputum showed no growth, although there is no evidence of infiltrate on CXR. Urine showed no growth as well. The patient's antibiotics will be discontinued today as he has been afebrile with no identifiable source. Two C. diff tests in the last week were negative, and a third test will be done to rule out C. diff infection. Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on the CD4 count (53). Treatment coverage for PCP will be considered, but the patient's oxygenation is good, and he has been on prophylaxis. The patient's PICC line will be kept for now, with readdress following CX results. Metoprolol dosage will be titrated down to 37.5 mg TID today. Follow-up CXR and clinical signs will be monitored. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure appears to be in the mid-90s, and he has had one reading of 84/52. The patient is at risk for hypotension due to advanced HIV and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of HIV currently undergoing treatment for admission with hypotension. The patient has shown a reasonable response to empirical antibiotic therapy, with a goal for a 5-day course. 

The patient's vital signs show persistent mild hypotension, with blood pressure readings ranging from 86/35 mmHg to 91/53 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 90 to 111 beats per minute. Respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, which is within normal range. Oxygen saturation remains at 100% while using a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hematocrit (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Creatinine levels are within normal range, and troponin T levels are below the detection limit, indicating no signs of acute myocardial infarction. Other lab values such as glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

Imaging shows a tracheostomy in place with no significant change. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of fever with continued empiric antibiotic therapy (Vancomycin and Zosyn) for a total of 5 days. Hypotension is being closely monitored, as the patient's blood pressures have been consistently low but have not shown"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.

   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient has a history of advanced HIV but no recent CD4 count. He is at high risk for infection due to advanced immunosuppression and indwelling lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has been positive for blood cultures in the past, and there is concern for ongoing bacteremia despite previous antibiotic treatment.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of positive sputum cultures and significant immunosuppression, which puts him at risk for pneumonia. However, his current CXR does not show evidence of infiltrates.
3. Fever: The patient previously had a temperature of 101.6 but was afebrile overnight. Monitoring for fever and following up on sputum, blood, stool, and urine cultures is important.
4. Airway issues: The patient has an altered gag reflex, copious secretions, and baseline colonization. There is a risk for aspiration and monitoring airway clearance is necessary.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has a sinus tachycardia likely related to long-standing issues, possibly due to HIV or other underlying conditions. Decreasing the dose of metoprolol and monitoring for hypotension is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -                Continue to monitor Hct

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). He is currently admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures indicate a bacterial infection, which can progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.

2. Pneumonia: Although there is no clear evidence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray, the patient's significant immunosuppression makes him at high risk for respiratory infections. The presence of pseudomonas in the sputum culture may require treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

3. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient has had multiple negative stool cultures for CDI, but further testing should be done to rule out this possibility, especially considering his immunocompromised state.

4. Tuberculosis (TB): Given the patient's advanced HIV/AIDS, he is at increased risk for TB infection. Workup for TB should be considered, including a chest X-ray and sputum culture for acid-fast bacilli.

5. Opportunistic infections: Due to his severely compromised immune system, the patient is susceptible to various opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), cryptococcal meningitis, and histoplasmosis. Monitoring for symptoms and appropriate diagnostic tests should"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed sparse growth of pseduomonas, though no evidence of
   infiltrate on CXR
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated down
   Metoprolol  to 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive blood culture several weeks ago; was on
   vanco in past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how
   old.
   - Ceftaz for pseudomonas in sputum
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   -          hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
   -          New sputum cult  postivive for pseudomonas, started  Ceftaz
   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

   Disposition: In ICU until placed
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known PML (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, which may indicate a possible infection or sepsis. The presence of positive blood and sputum cultures suggests bacterial infection, leading to bacteremia.

2. Pneumonia: Although the chest X-ray does not show clear evidence of pneumonia, the patient has significant immunosuppression due to advanced HIV/AIDS. Therefore, there is a risk of developing pneumonia, especially since the sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

3. Catheter-related infection: The patient has an indwelling PICC line, and the duration of its presence is unclear. There is a potential risk of developing a catheter-related bloodstream infection.

4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has had multiple negative stool cultures for C. difficile, but further workup is needed to rule out this infection since it can cause severe diarrhea and colitis, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

5. PML exacerbation: PML is a progressive neurological disorder caused by the reactivation of the John Cunningham (JC) virus in immunocom"

   [**2137-8-10**].
   Assessment and Plan
   36 yo male admit with hypotension and now with reasonable improvement
   in BP with IVF given.  He has had response quite rapidly in the setting
   of antibiotics but with such rapid return to baseline and absence of
   culture results have discontinued Vanco/Zosyn with continued good
   hemodynamic response.  The one concerning finding is the evolution of
   pseudomonas on sputum sample returning yesterday.  In addition
patient
   has evolution and persistence of increased pulmonary secretions which
   this morning are associated with intermittent desaturations.  This
   would argue for ongoing signficiant bacterial infection and would
   presume that it is at least the pseudomonas found in his sputum.
   Hypotension-
   -Maintained baseline blood pressure at this time.
   HIV-

","The patient is a 36-year-old male admitted with hypotension. He has shown improvement in blood pressure with IV fluid administration. Antibiotics have been initiated and the patient's condition has rapidly improved. However, the presence of Pseudomonas on sputum culture is concerning, along with the persistence of increased pulmonary secretions and intermittent desaturations. These findings suggest ongoing significant bacterial infection, potentially due to Pseudomonas.

The patient's current conditions include hypotension, HIV, pneumonia (Pseudomonas infection), and fever. The plan includes prescribing Cefepime for Pseudomonas infection, following up with cultures, monitoring blood cultures, and continuing pulmonary toilet.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypotension, further spread of Pseudomonas infection, development of antibiotic resistance, and respiratory distress due to aspiration risk."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed sparse growth of pseduomonas, though no evidence of
   infiltrate on CXR
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated down
   Metoprolol  to 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive blood culture several weeks ago; was on
   vanco in past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how
   old.
   - Ceftaz for pseudomonas in sputum
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   -          Will keep PICC in for now
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   -          hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
   -          New sputum cult  postivive for pseudomonas, started  Ceftaz
   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline to decrease secretions
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   - not responsive to  pain today
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). He is admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient has a history of multiple pulmonary infections with antibiotic resistance. His current conditions include pneumonia, hypotension, bacteremia, and chronic anemia. The patient's mental status is poor, and he is unresponsive to pain and touch. He has a tracheostomy in place with copious secretions and baseline colonization. The patient's airway is at risk due to his inability to protect it. He is on HAART therapy for his HIV and atovaquone for prophylaxis. The patient's CD4 count was last measured prior to HAART initiation. He has a history of EtOH abuse but is currently not at risk for withdrawal issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas, which is sensitive to Zosyn and another antibiotic. He received four days of Vanc/Zosyn and will be treated for a total of 14 days. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia or development of antibiotic resistance.
2. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure appears to be in the mid-90s. He had one episode of low blood pressure (84/52) on 8/2. There is"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed pseudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Add vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and currently admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. He has a history of fever, which was present on 8/12 and had previously been afebrile for days. His sputum from 8/2 showed pseudomonas sensitive to zosyn, so he received 4 days of Vanc/zosyn and then 2 days of ceftazidime. The patient will continue on zosyn for a 14-day course.

The patient also has hypotension, with a baseline blood pressure in the mid-90s. He is at high risk for infection due to advanced HIV and an indwelling line. His urine showed no growth, and two C. diff tests were negative. The PICC line will be kept for now, and blood cultures are pending.

The patient's airway is currently secured with a tracheostomy, but he has copious secretions and baseline colonization. He is on scopolamine and amitriptyline to decrease secretions.

The patient has a history of tachycardia, which is likely long-standing. His heart rate is usually between 90-115 beats per minute. He is on metoprolol 50 mg TID, and his blood pressure is being monitored.

The patient has HIV with a CD4 count of 53. He"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
    # PNEUMONIA:
   -          Sputum culture from [**8-7**] grew out pseudomonas, sensitive to
   Zosyn and [**Name (NI) **]
   -          Pt received 4 days of Vanc/zosyn
   -          Will plan on treating for 14 days total: with 4 days of
   zosyn and started [**Name (NI) **] [**8-11**], will plan on stop date of [**2137-8-20**]
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated down
   Metoprolol  to 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive blood culture several weeks ago; was on
   vanco in past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how
   old.
   - [**Hospital1 **] for pseudomonas in sputum
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   -          Will keep PICC in for now
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   -          hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
   -          New sputum cult  postivive for pseudomonas, started  [**Hospital1 **]
   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline to decrease secretions
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.

   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   - not responsive to  pain today
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Added vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 on [**2137-8-7**] from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8 and stable since
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and tracheostomy in place. He was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient has a fever of 103.6, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and Zosyn, but remains febrile. His sputum culture showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to Zosyn. The patient's blood cultures are pending. He has a history of chronic anemia, likely due to HAART. His vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. The patient has a tracheostomy and copious secretions, for which he is being treated. He is also at risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex. He has a history of ethanol abuse but is not currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. The patient's CD4 count is 53, indicating severe immunosuppression. He is on HAART and prophylactic medications for opportunistic infections. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and goals of care discussion with the family resulted in a code status change to DNR/DNI.

   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect

   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash

   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to

","The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient has a history of fever, which has been intermittent and now presents with a high fever. He also has hypotension, with a baseline blood pressure in the mid-90s and one reading of 84/52 on 8/2. The patient's advanced HIV status puts him at high risk for infection. He has an indwelling PICC line, which is not showing any signs of infection. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and his sputum showed pseudomonas, which is sensitive to zosyn. He is currently on vancomycin and zosyn, and will continue with zosyn for a 14-day course.

The patient's urine showed no growth, and two C-diffs have been negative during this stay. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, including repeated cultures and other diagnostic tests as needed. The patient's airway is compromised, and he is at risk for aspiration due to copious secretions and baseline colonization. His current medication regimen includes acetaminophen for fever, metoprolol for hypertension, HAART for HIV, atovaquone for prophylaxis, and nystatin cream for a perirectal fungal rash. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, which is likely"

The patient has been experiencing fever spikes despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's temperature has been consistently elevated, with a current reading of 103.6 rectal. A pan culture was taken, including off the PICC line. The patient's chest X-ray showed no change from previous examinations. C. difficile was negative once. Sputum culture showed growth of gram-negative rods, with sensitivities pending. ID was consulted regarding a possible source of infection, and no signs of infection around the PICC line were found. The patient's urine output dropped over the afternoon, and they became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s-90s and heart rates in the 130s. The patient received three 500 mL normal saline infusions, with an improvement in heart rate and blood pressure. They were then given a nightly dose of Lopressor. The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s, and an additional 50 mL of normal saline was given, resulting in blood pressures up to the 100s. Heart rate decreased to 122. Secretions have increased, and the scopolamine patch was restarted.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Add vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash

   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). He is admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient's chief complaint is fever, and he has a history of fever spikes to 103.6 rectally. He was previously afebrile for days and had a temperature of 101 on August 12th. The patient has been experiencing hypotension since admission, with a baseline blood pressure in the mid-90s. His most recent blood pressure reading was 84/52 on August 2nd.

The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas infection in his sputum and is currently on Zosyn for treatment. He also has a urinary tract infection, but the urine culture showed no growth. The patient has two negative Clostridium difficile tests during his stay. His blood cultures are pending, and he is being monitored for any changes.

The patient has a history of airway issues, including tracheostomy, copious secretions, and baseline colonization. His tracheostomy was performed, and he is experiencing increased secretions. Scopolamine has been decreased due to potential contribution to fever, and amitriptyline has been added to decrease secretions.

The patient has a history of tachycardia, which is likely long-standing. His heart rate is in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known PML (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy). He is currently admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient's fever returned on [**Month/Day (4)**], and he has been switched back to Zosyn due to absence of fever while on Vanc/Zosyn. The patient has a history of indwelling PICC line, which shows no evidence of infection. His baseline blood pressure appears to be in the mid-90s, and he may have low-grade temperatures. The patient's CD4 count is 53, indicating advanced HIV with a high risk for infection. He has been on HAART for four months.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has positive blood and sputum cultures, indicating a possible ongoing infection. He has been treated with various antibiotics, including Zosyn, Vanc, and Bactrim. The patient's immune system is compromised due to advanced HIV/AIDS, making him susceptible to infections.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 77/44 mmHg to 90/52 mmHg. This could be due to sepsis secondary to infection or possibly related to his HIV/AIDS condition. The patient has received boluses of normal saline and is on prophylactic hepar"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Added vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 on [**2137-8-7**] from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8 and stable since
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He is currently admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient's medical history includes fever, hypotension, sinus tachycardia, inability to protect airway, chronic anemia, history of EtOH abuse, and HIV.

The patient has been experiencing a fever overnight, with a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C). He also has hypotension with a blood pressure of 77/44 mmHg. His heart rate is elevated at 129 bpm, and his respiratory rate is within normal limits at 22 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 98% on the tracheostomy mask.

The patient's blood cultures and sputum cultures have shown positive results for an infection. He has been receiving various antibiotics including Ceftazidime, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). However, due to the presence of fever and negative response to Zosyn, it has been decided to switch back to Zosyn for the remainder of the antibiotic course.

The patient has atypical lymphocytes on smear, and tests for CMV and EBV viral loads have been ordered. His urine analysis shows pyuria, and blood cultures are pending.

The patient's blood work reveals leukopenia with a white blood cell count"

   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
   #. Fevers: Continues to spike fevers despite antibiotics and suspicion
   of a central process rather than infectious. No cultures positive
   except the PSA in sputum which is likely a colonization. Will d/c
   antibiotics as per ID recs. Will re-initiate if patient becomes
   unstable. Will follow up viral cultures including CMV VL.
   #. Hypotension: Have decreased the beta blocker. Will give fluids as

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). He is currently admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The patient continues to spike fevers despite antibiotics, and there is suspicion of a central process rather than an infection. The cultures have been positive for PSA in the sputum, which is likely colonization. It has been decided to discontinue antibiotics as per Infectious Disease recommendations, but they will be re-initiated if the patient becomes unstable.

The patient's hypotension is being managed by decreasing the beta blocker and providing fluids as necessary. The patient is also on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) and Prophylactic PCN (PPX).

The prognosis for PML is quite poor, and the family is aware of this. They are working out the extent of management they want to continue. A formal consult with a neurologist has been planned if it will change the management, but for now, it has been decided to hold off. An update will be provided to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle)**] with details. The family will be approached about a post-mortem evaluation of PML.

The patient is currently unable to protect his airway after undergoing tracheostomy. He is on a tracheal mask, and his oxygen saturation is well maintained. Amitriptyline has been prescribed to reduce secretions, and the scopolamine patch dose will be decreased as able, as it may be contributing to fevers.

The patient's sinus tachycardia is likely due to hypovolemia plus sepsis. Metoprolol, which was previously given QID, has had its dose decreased, and the heart rate has improved slightly today.

The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, but there are no concerns about withdrawal since he has been at [**Hospital1 630**].

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving Nutrition 2.0 with 50mg Beneprotein at 40mL/hour with banana flakes to thicken the stool. Glycemic control is being maintained with regular blood glucose monitoring, and the levels are within normal range. The patient has a PICC line inserted on [**2137-8-6**].

In terms of prophylaxis, the patient is on subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and famotidine for stress ulcers. The patient's disposition is DNR/DNI with no pressors and no escalation of care. The family wants antibiotics, fluids, nutrition, anti-pyretics, and narcotics. Morphine will be given if the patient appears uncomfortable."

   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and fever.
   #. Fevers: Continues to spike fevers despite antibiotics and suspicion
   of a central process rather than infectious. No cultures positive
   except the PSA in sputum which is likely a colonization. Will d/c
   antibiotics as per ID recs. Will re-initiate if patient becomes
   unstable. Will follow up viral cultures including CMV VL.
   #. Hypotension: Have decreased the beta blocker. Will give fluids as
   necessary.
   #. HIV/AIDS: Continuing HAART and PPX
   #. PML: Prognosis and quality of life quite poor now. Family aware and
   still working out extent of management they want to continue. Spoke
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] who had seen the patient before but never actually
   been his primary neurologist. Will formally consult with neuro if we
   feel it will change our management but for now will hold off. Will
   update Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] with details. Will approach family about a
   post-mortem to eval PML.
   #. Inability to protect airway now s/p trach. On trach mask satting
   well. Amytriptiline to reduce secretions. Will decrease scopolamine
   patch as able as may be contributing to fevers.

   #. Sinus Tachycardia in setting of hypotension likely hypovolemia plus
   sepsis. On Metoprolol QID with dose decreased yesterday and HR a little
   bit better today.
   #. H/O EtOH abuse: None since has been at [**Hospital1 630**] and no reason to be

   #. ICU CARE:
   - Nutrition: Nutren 2.0 with 50mg Beneprotein at 40mL/hour with banana
   flakes to thicken stool
   - Glycemic control: BGs WNL
   - Lines: PICC Line present at admission.
   #. PPX:
   - DVT: SC Heparin
   - Stress ulcer: Famotidine
   # Code Status: DNR/DNI with no pressors and no escalation of care.
   Family want antibiotics, fluids, nutrition, anti-pyretics, and
   narcotics. Will give morphine if patient appears uncomfortable.
   .
   # Dispo: ICU while inpatient, nursing needs exceed floor capacity.  Can
   discuss plan for dispo to rehab, though patient likely to continue to
   have fevers given recent trends.

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). He was admitted with hypotension and fever. The patient continues to spike fevers despite antibiotics, suggesting a central process rather than an infection. No cultures are positive except for the PSA in sputum, which is likely colonization. Antibiotics have been discontinued per ID recommendations. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased to 470, although the WBC count has increased. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and low albumin levels. Imaging has not been performed. The patient is unable to protect his airway and is on a tracheostomy with good oxygen saturation. He is on HAART and PPX. The patient has sinus tachycardia, anemia, and a history of EtOH abuse. Prognosis and quality of life are poor due to PML. The family is aware and working out the extent of management they want to continue. Neurology consultation has been discussed but not yet initiated. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI with no pressors and no escalation of care. The family wants antibiotics, fluids, nutrition, anti-pyretics, and narcotics. The patient's mother is the healthcare proxy and can be reached at [**Name (NI) 249**]."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and fever.
   #. Fevers: Continued to spike fevers despite antibiotics and suspicion
   of a central process rather than infectious. No cultures positive
   except the PSA in sputum which is likely colonization.  Antibiotics
   d/c
d [**8-15**] as per ID recs. Will re-initiate if patient becomes
   unstable. Now afebrile on tylenol
   -          CMV Ab not detected
   -          C. diff negative [**8-15**]
   -          EBV PCR pending
   -          ANC down to 470, t hough WBC count increased
   -          Tylenol 650 mg q 6hrs
   -          Cx for temp spikes if no cx in previous 48 hrs
   #. Hypotension: Have discontinued beta blocker. Will give fluids as
   necessary.
   #. HIV/AIDS: Continuing HAART and PPX
   #. Inability to protect airway now s/p trach. On trach mask satting
   well.
   -          Increase Amytriptiline to reduce secretions.
   -          Continue scopolamine patch
   .
   #. Sinus Tachycardia:  Pt has been off Metoprolol for several days, and
   HR remains in 110s.  This may be due to developing anemia, see below.
   # Anemia: Hct down to 21.7 from 24 yesterday, without a clear source or
   cause.
   -          Recheck PM Hct
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Transfuse 1 unit if Hct < 21
   -          Consider further evaluation of abdominal pain if continued
   decrease in Hct
   #. PML: Prognosis and quality of life quite poor now. Mother  aware and
   still working out extent of management they want to continue. Spoke
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] who had seen the patient before but never actually
   been his primary neurologist. Will formally consult with neuro if we
   feel it will change our management but for now will hold off. Will
   update Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] with details. Will approach family about a
   post-mortem to eval PML.
   #. H/O EtOH abuse: None since has been at [**Hospital1 630**] and no reason to be
   concerned about withdrawal.
   #. ICU CARE:
   - Nutrition: Nutren 2.0 with 50mg Beneprotein at 40mL/hour with banana
   flakes to thicken stool
   - Glycemic control: BGs WNL
   - Lines: PICC Line present at admission.
   #. PPX:
   - DVT: SC Heparin
   - Stress ulcer: Famotidine
   # Code Status: DNR/DNI with no pressors and no escalation of care.
   Family want antibiotics, fluids, nutrition, anti-pyretics, and
   narcotics. Will give morphine if patient appears uncomfortable.
   # Communication: Mother [**Name (NI) 249**] is HCP; number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3958**]
   .
   # Dispo: to floor
   .
   #DNR/DNI ICU while inpatient, nursing needs currently exceed floor
   capacity.   Can discuss transfer to floor next week or possible return
   to rehab if patient remains afebrile.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and a known diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). He was admitted with hypotension and fever. The patient continues to have spikes in fever despite antibiotics, suggesting a central process rather than an infection. No cultures have been positive except for colonization in the sputum.

The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count has increased from 3.4 to 5.9, indicating an immune response. His hemoglobin (Hct) level has decreased from 26.3 to 21.7, suggesting anemia. The cause of this anemia is unclear.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/64 to 113/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the tracheostomy mask.

Physical examination reveals unconsciousness, staring, right pupil unresponsive to light, left pupil dilated but responsive to light, supple neck, regular rhythm and normal S1S2 heart sounds without S3S4, coarse ronchi bilaterally, and bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 0.7 mg/dL, glucose at 130 mg/dL, lactic acid at"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and a known diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and fever. The patient continues to spike fevers despite antibiotics, suggesting a central process rather than an infection. Antibiotics have been discontinued based on ID recommendations. The patient's white blood cell count has increased, and he is showing signs of anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 21.7. The cause of the anemia is unclear. The patient is unable to protect his airway and is currently on a tracheostomy (trach) with good oxygen saturation. His heart rate remains in the 110s, which may be due to developing anemia. The patient is on HAART therapy for HIV/AIDS and is also receiving prophylactic penicillin (PPX) due to a history of ethanol abuse. The patient has a poor prognosis and quality of life, and the family is considering management options. There are no concerns about alcohol withdrawal. The patient's nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding, and his blood glucose levels are within normal range. He is on SC heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and the family wishes to provide antibiotics, fluids, nutrition, antipyretics"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). He was admitted with hypotension and fever, and currently has a tracheostomy in place. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/64 to 113/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask. The patient's weight is currently 84 kg.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including Tylenol, heparin sodium, and ICU medications. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted abnormalities.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 1,959 mL of fluid intake and 1,340 mL of fluid output, with a balance of 619 mL. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheal mask, and his ABG results are as follows: pH 7.30, PCO2 30 mmHg, PO2 99 mmHg, HCO3 15 mg/dL, and base excess -26.3.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. Lab results show a white blood cell count of 3.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8"
