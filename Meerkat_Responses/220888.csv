","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, schizoaffective disorder, and impaired skin integrity. She presents with shortness of breath and confusion. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 105/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She is receiving supplemental oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 65 mmHg, PaO2 of 86 mmHg, and HCO3- of 34 mEq/L. She has an elevated white blood cell count and elevated lactate levels. The patient's mental status is disoriented, and she is agitated. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of COPD, possibly secondary to a respiratory infection. Other potential causes such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism are less likely given her history and physical examination findings. She has been started on IV solumedrol, Combivent nebs, and antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftazidime, and azithromycin. A sputum culture has been sent to rule out Legionella and influenza. Bair hugger has been initiated for hypothermia, and a repeat chest X-ray will be obtained in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, schizoaffective disorder, and impaired skin integrity presenting with shortness of breath (SOB). She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with acute exacerbation of COPD, hypothermia, possible right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. The patient is receiving IV solumedrol, combivent nebs, and antibiotics until further data is obtained. Her mental status is altered, possibly due to hypercarbia from CO2 retention, but has improved on BiPAP. She also has hyponatremia, which may be caused by an infectious process, medications, or other factors. The patient's baseline mental status needs to be determined, and electrolyte imbalances need to be corrected. Restarting antipsychotic medications is necessary once her mental status improves. Other concerns include impaired skin integrity, delirium/confusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's COPD exacerbation and possible RLL infiltrate put her at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The elevated WBC count and presence of fever suggest an underlying infection that needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Skin Breakdown: The patient's"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical conditions and complications. 

The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to immobility or pressure ulcers. Delirium/confusion is also present, which can be caused by various factors such as medication side effects, infections, or organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, with an acute exacerbation currently occurring. This could be indicated by the need for respiratory support and the ABG results showing respiratory acidosis.

Additionally, the patient has hypothermia (Tmax: 38.1°C), hypotension (BP: 105/54 mmHg), tachycardia (HR: 76 bpm), and low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 90%). The vital signs indicate the patient's unstable condition.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 12.6 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct: 40.2%), normal platelet count (Plt: 173 K/uL), and normal creatinine levels (Cr: 0.6 mg/dL). Glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, alk phosphatase, amylase/lipase, and electrolytes may indicate ongoing inflammation or organ dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   61F h/o COPD and CO2 retention, schizoaffective disorder presents with
   SOB.
   .
   # SOB: Likely COPD flare with possible underlying respiratory infection
   given wheezing, hypothermia, possible RLL infiltrate, and elevated WBC
   (had recently been on steroids but increased despite taper).
   Differential includes PE or cardiac but less likely given history and
   exam.
   - IV solumedrol 125mg q8h
   - Combivent nebs
   - Continue vanc/ceftaz/azithro until more data obtained
   - Sputum culture, legionella urine Ag, nasal viral swabs
   - Bair hugger for hypothermia, trend temperature
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Counsel on smoking cessation
   .
   # AMS: Chronic psych disorder (unclear baseline alhtough [**3-22**] d/c
   summary states A&Ox1-2) but acutely presumably due to hypercarbia from
   retention on NRB, now improved on BiPAP per ED but remains disoriented.
   Hyponatremia could be significant and infectious process or medications
   (antipsychotics, steroids) may also be contributing.
   - Maintain O2sat 88-90%
   - Treat infectious process per above and hyponatremia per below
   - Tox screens
   - f/u TSH and free T4
   - Hold antipsychotic medications for now
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Discharge Na 135, now 112 in ED. Likely hypovolemic
   given appears dry on exam, however may be spurious.
   - Repeat electrolytes now then Na Q2H until clear improvement
   - Check plasma and urine osmolality
   - Consider hypertonic saline to increase Na above 120 (rate less than
   0.5meq/hr), then transition to normal saline
   - Consider renal consult should not improve
   .
   # Schizoaffective disorder:  Hold outpatient medications for now until
   menstal status improves then restart chlordiazepoxide, promethazine,
   and topiramate.
   - Consider psych consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, schizoaffective disorder, and impaired skin integrity. She presents with shortness of breath, confusion, and possible respiratory infection indicated by wheezing and elevated white blood cell count. The patient has hypothermia, possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, and hyponatremia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of COPD and current symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as exacerbation of COPD, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest an underlying infection. This could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's current disorientation may be attributed to hypercarbia from CO2 retention, medications, or an infectious process.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to various complications such as seizures, neurological damage, or cardiac dysrhythmias if not corrected appropriately.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores, especially while immobilized in the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of COPD exacerbation who presents with hypothermia, hyponatremia, and respiratory distress. 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for COPD exacerbation and is currently requiring non-invasive ventilation. The treatment plan includes administering IV medrol, nebs, BIPAP, Vancomycin, Ceftazidime, and Azithromycin, along with checking sputum culture and nasal aspirate.

The patient's sodium levels are low, and there are concerns about dehydration, cerebral salt wasting, or adrenal crisis. The patient has been given D5W to prevent an acute rise in sodium levels and has stabilized at 131 mEq/L. Further tests will be done to monitor serum and urine osmolarity, urine sodium, and determine if the patient's sodium levels are close to her baseline.

Psychiatric medications will be restarted, and the patient's remaining issues will be addressed as per the housestaff notes. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU with a code status of full code and an expected disposition of remaining in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, presenting with hypothermia, hyponatremia, and respiratory distress. She is currently in the ICU and requires non-invasive ventilation due to the exacerbation. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, delirium/confusion, and other medical conditions. She is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment for her various issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed with non-invasive ventilation and other medications.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or organ dysfunction.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need careful correction to avoid complications like seizures or neurological damage.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The presence of impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or infections, which can worsen the patient's condition.
5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium or confusion can increase the risk of falls, self-removal of tubes or lines, and other complications associated with altered mental status.
6. Myoclonic Jerks: The patient's myoclonic jerks could be a sign of hypercarbia, hypoNa, or cerebral vascular accident ("

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), schizoaffective disorder, and impaired skin integrity. She presents to the ICU with symptoms including shortness of breath, confusion, and hypothermia. The patient has been diagnosed with hyponatremia, COPD exacerbation, and possible underlying respiratory infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, dry mouth, expiratory wheezes, and mild crackles bilaterally in the chest. Neurologic examination shows alertness, orientation to person and place, and ability to follow simple commands. The patient's skin integrity is compromised, as evidenced by wounds on her lower extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, platelet count of 173 K/uL, blood glucose of 206 mg/dL, sodium of 134 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab values, including PT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has impaired skin integrity, delirium/confusion, hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality), and impaired mental status with electrolyte abnormalities. He was started on psychotropic medications but experienced a rash due to an allergic reaction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 123/55 mmHg to 157/80 mmHg, heart rate between 76-92 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient received multiple antibiotics and had an episode of excessive coughing causing desaturation, which resolved with nebulizer treatment. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and lactate levels. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, and his electrolytes are being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of COPD symptoms, respiratory infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further episodes of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), schizoaffective disorder, and recent admission to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have hypothermia, possible right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and elevated CO2 levels. The patient was started on intravenous steroids, nebulizers, and antibiotics. The patient's mental status was fluctuating, and there were concerns about delirium, confusion, and hyponatremia (low sodium). The patient's skin integrity is also impaired.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Infection: The patient's symptoms, including SOB, hypothermia, possible RLL infiltrate, and elevated WBC, suggest a respiratory infection. This could potentially worsen the patient's COPD exacerbation and lead to pneumonia or another serious respiratory complication.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing COPD may worsen due to the acute exacerbation, leading to increased respiratory distress, respiratory failure, or the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's fluctuating mental status raises concerns about delirium or confusion, which could be caused by various factors such as hypercarbia from CO2 retention, medications (ant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of COPD exacerbation, hypothermia, and hyponatremia. She presented with respiratory distress and was initially requiring non-invasive ventilation. Her condition improved with IV medrol, nebs, and BIPAP, and she will be switched to oral Prednisone. She has also been prescribed Azithromycin since no growth or evolving infiltrate was observed. Nebulizers and MDIs will continue to be used.

The patient's hyponatremia is due to low serum and urine osmolarity, with urine sodium levels less than 10. She autodiuresed after admission, indicating dehydration, but she had been drinking massive amounts of hypotonic fluids at home. Her sodium levels are now back at her baseline in the low 130 range.

Psychiatric medications have been restarted, and the patient's family has been informed about her condition. She will be transferred to the floor for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required non-invasive ventilation, indicating respiratory distress. There is a potential risk of respiratory failure if her COPD exacerbation worsens or if she develops any complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
2. Infection: Despite being prescribed antibiotics (Ceftazidime, Azithromycin, and Vancomycin), there is still a risk of infection due to her compromised immune system and underlying COPD."

","Summary:
The patient is a 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of COPD exacerbation and hyponatremia. The patient's condition has been monitored closely in the ICU, with various interventions and assessments carried out. The patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support are regularly documented. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in sodium, potassium, and other electrolyte levels. The patient has impaired skin integrity, delirium/confusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient also has hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Due to the patient's COPD exacerbation and respiratory distress, there is a potential risk of respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection that needs to be identified and treated promptly.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium/confusion could be due to multiple factors such as COPD exacerbation, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying medical conditions. It is important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and abnormal chest X-ray findings suggest a possible pneumonia. Further evaluation and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent worsening of the condition.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile in the ICU"
