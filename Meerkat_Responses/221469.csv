   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now, but will start empirically if
   patient spikes a temp
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Bronch likely today
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   .
   #. h/o seizure:  ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   #. Elevated PTT:  Resolved.  In setting of normal INR - ?heparin
   exposure, consider lupus anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Holding metformin given recent ingestion
   - discontinued insulin drip yesterday, as no evidence of CCB
   ingestion.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   #. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive
   .
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented to the ICU following an overdose and seizure. He required invasive ventilation and was intubated with a charcoal-filled endotracheal tube. The patient has been on multiple pressors for hypotension, which is likely secondary to the overdose and metabolic acidosis. He also has respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonitis or shunt physiology. There is evidence of lactic acidosis, possibly due to metformin ingestion, and acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a stress response or potential infection. Electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, have been addressed. Other medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and anemia are being managed accordingly. The patient is currently sedated and on several medications, including dopamine, norepinephrine, midazolam, cisatracurium, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis may worsen if given normal saline, so D5W with bicarb will continue to be used for volume resuscitation. ABG trends will be monitored, and if worsening acidosis occurs, the bicarbonate drip may be restarted.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He has undergone several procedures and interventions, including arterial line placement, dialysis catheter placement, and multi-lumen central venous catheter insertion.

The patient's vital signs have been monitored regularly, showing fluctuations in temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. His hemodynamic monitoring includes measurements of central venous pressure (CVP). Fluid balance data indicates significant fluid intake and output over the past 24 hours.

The patient is receiving multiple medications through infusions, including norepinephrine, midazolam, dopamine, cisatracurium, fentanyl, and phenylephrine. Insulin, midazolam, and fentanyl have been administered at specific times.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted respiratory distress. The flow sheet data provides detailed information on the patient's vital signs, hemodynamics, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires invasive ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to optimize respiratory support and prevent further respiratory compromise.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   1. Overdose
   Known ingestions include metformin and levothyroxine as well as unknown
   depressants. Concern for possible TCA o/d.
   - will attempt to contact outside treaters and obtain accurate med list
   - serial ABG and EKGs
   - bicarb drip
   - LFTs WNL, no evidence for tylenol intake holding on NAC
   - follow up toxicology recommendations
   - psychiatric and social work consults. needs 1:1 when awake.
   .
   2. Hypotension
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to overdose, potentially TCA. Not bradycardic to
   suggest beta blocker overdose, no history of CCB use. Infection seems
   less likely - could have SIRS however following aspiration. Does not
   appear to be volume depleted at this point. Patient does have history
   of depressed EF (uncertain cause based on available records) but think
   cardiogenic shock less likely.
   - TTE
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Continue neo/levophed
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   3. h/o aspiration
   Patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal.
   Probably has an aspiration pneumonitis
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now
   - Bronch when stabilized, check sputum
   .
   4. Hypoxia
   Possible evolving ARDS in setting of aspiration
   - Increase PEEP
   .
   4. h/o seizure
   ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   5. Acidosis
   He has evidence for a gap and non gap (hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis). Metabolic acidosis present in the setting of elevated
   lactate, potentially metformin related but would also consider
   infection. DKA less likely. Nongap acidosis probably secondary to NS
   resuscitation.
   - bicarbonate drip as above
   - serial ABGs
   - renal recommendations appreciated ?CVVH
   - Titrate up sedation for better synchroncy with vent, incr RR
   .
   6. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to stress response / post seizure, but in setting
   of lactic acidosis also need to rule out infection.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures, check sputum
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   7. Acute renal failure
   Baseline Cr uncertain. BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - renal re ?CVVH
   .
   8. Elevated PTT
   In setting of normal INR - ?heparin exposure, consider lupus
   anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - type and screen
   .
   9. Anemia
   Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   10. Diabetes mellitus
   - Hold metformin
   - Insulin drip target <150
   .
   11. Hypothyroidism
   - hold levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   12. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia in spikes
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   2). Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on levophed only.  Will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue levophed and wean as tolerated
   - Give fluid bolus for pressor wean stall
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. Urine output improving after CVVH.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist
   FEN: NPO for now, IVF as needed for BP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented following an overdose of Metformin and an unknown calcium channel blocker (CCB), resulting in a seizure. The patient remains intubated but continues to improve clinically.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal, leading to an aspiration pneumonitis. However, the significant hypoxia does not have a clear cause and appears to involve shunt physiology. The patient is afebrile and has a decreasing white blood cell count.

Plan:
- Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia in spikes
- Follow sputum cultures
- Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean as tolerated
- Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic acidosis. He is currently on levophed only and will be weaned as tolerated.

Plan:
- Continue levophed and wean as tolerated
- Give fluid bolus for pressor wean stall

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is currently resolved, but will be repeated CVVH as needed.

Plan:
- Follow toxicology recommendations

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated

","The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented to the ICU following an overdose and seizure. He has multiple medical complications, including metabolic acidosis, hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and anemia.

Metabolic Acidosis:
The patient had evidence of a non-gap acidosis, which has since resolved since discontinuing normal saline (NS) and using D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation. The lactic acidosis secondary to metformin ingestion is being treated by holding NS and restarting CVVH if necessary. ABG trends will be monitored, and bicarbonate drip will be restarted if there is worsening acidosis.

Hypotension:
The patient's hypotension is most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic acidosis. He is currently on three pressors, and weaning will be done as tolerated. TTE did not show evidence of cardiac failure.

Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
The patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal. He may have an aspiration pneumonitis, but it does not explain significant hypoxia. The cause of the hypoxic respiratory failure is unclear, but it appears to involve shunt physiology. Antibiotics will be started empirically if the patient spikes a fever. Sputum cultures will be followed, and a bronch will likely be done today. Oxygenation will continue with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempting to we"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   5) Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   6) Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented after an overdose of metformin and an unknown calcium channel blocker (CCB) with subsequent seizure. He remains intubated but continues to show clinical improvement. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the progress note are as follows:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has significant hypoxia, which may be due to aspiration pneumonitis or shunt physiology. There is a need for further investigation and appropriate management.

2. Psychiatric Issues: The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts. Psychiatric recommendations are appreciated, and measures such as a 1:1 sitter when extubated and restarting medication per home regimen should be implemented.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has improving kidney function with good urine output, but baseline creatinine levels are uncertain. Close monitoring of urine output, renal dosing of medications, and CVVH as needed are recommended.

4. Hypotension: The patient no longer requires pressor support, but experiences fluctuations in blood pressure during sleep and waking. Fluid boluses should be given as needed to maintain stable blood pressure.

5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has resolved metabolic acidosis, but CVVH may still be required based on toxicology recommendations.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, which could be secondary to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia if evidence of infection
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Extubation trial today
   2). Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   4 Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   5 Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented with an overdose of Metformin and an unknown calcium channel blocker (CCB), resulting in a seizure. The patient remains intubated but continues to show clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal, which could have led to aspiration pneumonitis. However, the cause of significant hypoxia is unclear, and shunt physiology may be involved. The patient remains afebrile and WBC levels are decreasing.

2. Hypotension: The patient is no longer requiring pressor support, and blood pressure decreases during sleep but rises easily on waking. Fluid boluses may be given as needed.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: This condition has currently resolved. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) may be repeated as needed, following toxicology recommendations.

4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count is likely secondary to stress response/post-seizure. However, it is important to rule out infection, especially in the setting of lactic acidosis. The leukocytosis is trending down, and blood, sputum, and urine cultures should be followed up. Further antibiotics should be held off unless there is evidence of fever or other signs of infection.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented following an overdose of Metformin and an unknown calcium channel blocker (CCB) with subsequent seizure. The patient remains intubated but continues to improve clinically.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal, which may have resulted in an aspiration pneumonitis. This could explain the significant hypoxia and the need for ongoing respiratory support.

2. Psychiatric Disease: The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts. There are recommendations for psychiatric medications, but they are currently not being restarted. The patient will receive daily EKGs due to the use of haldol for sedation.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is uncertain, but it is currently improving with good urine output. It is important to follow urine output, dose medications accordingly, replete electrolytes as needed, and appreciate renal input.

4. Hypotension: The patient no longer requires pressor support, but blood pressure decreases during sleep and rises easily on waking. Fluid boluses may be given as needed to manage this.

5. Elevated Lipase: The patient has elevated lipase levels, which may indicate pancreatitis. TF (total parenteral nutrition) should be held, and the patient's abdominal pain, WBC count, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  CXR this morning c/w diffused b/l
   infiltrates
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - Attempt a PS trial, give haldol 5 mg TID for sedation and try to wean
   off of fentanyl and midaz.  If needed will add propofol for sedation,
   but will try to extubate if suctioning becomes less frequent.
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   # Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   FEN: TF today, IVF as needed for BP
   Access: R HD line, will attempt further access today

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal, leading to significant hypoxia. There is an indication of shunt physiology involved, and the patient remains afebrile with decreasing WBC count. A chest X-ray this morning showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Sputum specimens will not be held as they are unlikely to change management. The plan is to attempt a pressure support trial, provide haloperidol 5 mg TID for sedation, and try to wean off fentanyl and midazolam. If needed, propofol will be added for sedation, but the goal is to extubate if suctioning becomes less frequent.

2. Psychiatric Issues: The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts. Psychiatric recommendations are appreciated, and it is recommended to have a 1:1 sitter when extubated. Risperidone, Wellbutrin, and Lamictal will not be restarted at this time. Haloperidol will be given, and daily EKGs will be obtained.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   5) Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   6) Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented to the ICU after an overdose of metformin and another calcium channel blocker (CCB) with a subsequent seizure. He remains intubated but continues to improve clinically. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, psych issues, acute renal failure, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypothyroidism. The potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, worsening of renal failure, infection, and continued psychiatric issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if he does not tolerate weaning off sedation or if there are complications related to his intubation.
2. Worsening of renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and it is important to monitor his urine output and adjust medications accordingly. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) may be necessary if renal function deteriorates.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be secondary to the stress response or post-seizure. However, in the setting of lactic acidosis, it is important to rule out infection. Trending down WBC levels and obtaining blood, sputum, and urine cultures will help in identifying any potential infections.
4. Continued psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of depression and suicide"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  He remains afebrile but with increasing
   WBC.
   - Extubated, tolerating face mask now
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - LENI for questionable PE on CXR per radiology
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but rapidly improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Ileus: Patient nauseated/vomiting today without bowel movement
   -          KUB to evaluate for bowel loops/free air
   -          Aggressive bowel regiment
   # Hypertension:  Paitent
s BP 150s
   -          Wean Nitrodrip
   -          Amlodipine 5mg when tolerating PO
   # Elevated lipase:
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - Restart Levothyroxine 50mcg IV now to 112mcg PO when tolerating PO

","The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented to the ICU following an overdose of metformin and possibly a calcium channel blocker, resulting in seizure activity. He remains intubated but continues to show improvement clinically. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is still on invasive ventilation and may require continued respiratory support.

2. Psychiatric complications: The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts. There is a need for close psychiatric monitoring and consideration for a 1:1 sitter due to the risk of self-harm.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is uncertain, but there is a rapid improvement in kidney function with good urine output. Monitoring urine output and adjusting medications accordingly is important.

4. Ileus: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may indicate an ileus. Further evaluation with KUB (kidney-ureter-bladder) imaging and aggressive bowel regimen is recommended.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and weaning off the nitroglycerin drip while starting amlodipine when tolerating oral intake is necessary.

6. Elevated lipase: The patient has an elevated lipase level, which could indicate pancreatitis. Monitoring for symptoms and trends in WBC, abdominal pain, and fluid shifts is important.

7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has resolved metabolic acidosis and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an obese male who was previously intubated and received invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been sedated with Haldol and propofol to facilitate weaning off fentanyl and midazolam. The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, so he has been started on a nitroglycerin drip to control it. He experienced desaturation when extubated and required supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. The patient also vomited bilious material in the morning. His allergies include lactose-free food, and he has been receiving various ICU medications including pantoprazole, midazolam, fentanyl, and nitroglycerin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 181/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has been receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool mask and a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 650 mL. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 122. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and wheezing on the right side, as well as tenderness in the abdomen without guarding or rebound. The patient's neurologic"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  He remains afebrile but with increasing
   WBC.
   - Extubated, tolerating face mask now
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Ileus:
   # Hypotension:  Resolved.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs
   8) Hypothyroidism

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented to the ICU following an overdose of Metformin and an unknown cardiac calcium channel blocker (CCB). He experienced a seizure and remains intubated but is showing clinical improvement. The patient's medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, ileus, hypotension (resolved), elevated lipase, metabolic acidosis (resolved), leukocytosis, anemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and requires mechanical ventilation to support his breathing. There is a risk of further respiratory complications if the ventilator settings need to be adjusted or if there are any issues with the tube placement.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are affected, leading to an increase in serum creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: Due to acute renal failure and ongoing fluid management, there is a risk of developing electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia or hyponatremia. Regular monitoring of electrolyte levels and appropriate correction measures are necessary.
4. Infection: With leukocytosis and the presence of fever, there is a possibility of developing an infection. Cultures from blood, sputum, and urine should be obtained, and appropriate antimicrobial"
