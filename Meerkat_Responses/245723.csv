   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M admitted 4 days ago with acute CVA now transferred to the ICU
   with respiratory failure in the setting of a likely aspiration.
   Resp Failure:  Aspiration.  Rapid resolution of infiltrates implies
   pneumonitis rather than PNA.
     -SBT today.
     -Follow up sputum Cx. If no evidence of pathogens, will d/c abx.
     -D/C flagyl now.
     -Pulmonary toilet
   CVA:  Continues on ASA. , poor gag and doubt he will be able to defend
   airway given current exam
   Decreased HCT:  Possibly dilutional.  Some bleeding in foley bag

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 83-year-old male, was admitted 4 days ago with an acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is now in the ICU with respiratory failure likely due to aspiration. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/51 mmHg to 146/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 450 mL, RR set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and SpO2 at 94%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,010 mL and output of 1,245 mL, with a urine output of 1,145 mL. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets, with slightly elevated blood glucose and troponin T. Electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, except for a slightly low potassium level. Imaging reveals rapid resolution of left-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, with an endotracheal tube in place. Microbiology results for sputum culture are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concerns include respiratory failure secondary to aspiration"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom with recent right pontine stroke who was initially in the Neuro
   ICU who is not transferred to the MICU in the setting of aspiration.
   # Aspiration:  Patient was transferred yesterday for hypoxia, tachypnea
   and tachycardia in the setting of tube feeds.  He was intubated for
   respiratory distress/failure.  CXR initially showed marked left lung
   opacification.  CXR this morning shows marked clearing in consolidation
   which is consistent with aspiration pneumonitis.  Patient did spike a
   fever yesterday at noon but has remained afebrile since.  Sputum
   culture shows Gram+ cocci and gram
 rods.
   -  cont Vanco, Zosyn for now until culture is speciated.
   -  d/c ARDSNET protocol
   -  check gag reflex
   -  attempt SBT
   -  attempt extubation if tolerates SBP and +gag
   -  stop Flagyl
   -  f/u sputum cultures, blood Cx, Urine Cx
   -  NPO for now
   -  Discuss with family regarding possible PEG placement as patient will
   likely not tolerate tube feeds
   # Right Hemi-pontine infarction:
   -  f/u Neurology recs
   -  ASA 81mg daily
   -  cont statin
   -  SSI for optimal glucose control
   -  allow blood pressure to autoregulate in SBP 110-180 range
   # HTN
   -  hold BP meds, goal SBP 110-180
   # Anemia:  patient with drop in HCT from 39-33.   +red urine in foley
   bag, but unlikely to cause this amount of anemia
   -          recheck HCT
   -          UA
   -          Irrigate foley
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with increase in Cr from 1.0-1.3.
   Bun/Cr ratio > 20, making prerenal syndrome most likely cause.  Patient
   is likely dehydrated in setting of NPO status.
   -          1L IVF bolus
   -          Recheck Cr in PM

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke who was transferred from the Neuro ICU to the MICU due to hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia associated with aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient has a fever of 102.1Â°F and is showing signs of infection, as indicated by the presence of Gram+ cocci and gram rods in the sputum culture. Antibiotics have been started, and the plan is to continue vancomycin and Zosyn until the culture results are available.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with clearing consolidation on the chest X-ray. The plan is to discontinue the ARDSNet protocol and attempt spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) to assess readiness for extubation. If the patient tolerates SBP and demonstrates a gag reflex, extubation may be attempted.

The patient's right hemi-pontine infarction is being managed with neurology recommendations, including aspirin (ASA) 81 mg daily, statin therapy, and tight glucose control. Blood pressure is being allowed to autoregulate in the range of 110-180 mmHg.

The patient has a history of hypertension, and BP medications have been held, with a goal SBP of 110-180 mmHg.

Additionally, the patient has developed anemia, with a drop in hematocrit from 39% to"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is suspected to have developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's fever has been persistent, and blood cultures have been obtained. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/42-156/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 2,129 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.1-8.0 K/uL, anemia with a Hct level of 30.6-33.2%, and normal platelet count. Liver enzymes are within normal limits, while electrolytes show mild hypokalemia (K+ 3.7 mEq/L) and hyponatremia (Na+ 115 mEq/L). Renal function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels (Cr 1.1-1.3 mg/dL). Other lab results including troponin-T, TCO2, glucose, and arterial blood gas analysis are within normal limits.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke who was initially admitted to the Neuro ICU for aspiration. The patient's current condition shows signs of worsening left lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.7Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 110/42-65 mmHg, heart rate between 72-95 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.

The patient has been placed on prophylactic antibiotics, including vancomycin and ceftazidime, due to suspected aspiration pneumonia. The plan is to continue the current antibiotic regimen and attempt a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient's PEG tube placement was uneventful, and a chest X-ray showed no perforation. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth).

The patient also has a right hemi-pontine infarction, for which they are to follow up with neurology recommendations, continue aspirin and statin therapy, and allow blood pressure to autoregulate with a systolic blood pressure range of 110-180 mmHg. Additionally, the patient has a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), with a urine analysis showing white blood cells, red blood cells, and nitrites. The plan is to continue ceftazidime and follow up with urine cultures.

   83 yo M admitted with acute CVA now transferred to the ICU with
   respiratory failure in the setting of a likely aspiration.
   Resp Failure:  Aspiration.  Persistent fevers and worsening infiltrates
   today suggest pneumonia vs pneumonitis.
     -Will continue with empiric Vanco/Ceftaz until cultures are
   finalized.
     -Pulmonary toilet, may need bronchoscopy when ready to extubate in a
   day or so or earlier if problems with atelectasis
     -Given copious secretions and possible impaired gag, will likely need
   better pulmonary toilet before extubation is possible.
   CVA:  Continues on ASA.
   Decreased HCT:  Possibly dilutional.  Now stable
   Hematuria:  Now resolved.  Likely related to traumatic foley placement.
    Aspiration risk:  PEG tube placed today.   If recurrent aspiration is

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to a likely aspiration event. He has a history of acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. He underwent placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube today. He has been febrile since yesterday and has moderate tan secretions, requiring suctioning every 2 hours overnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7Â°C (101.7Â°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/55 mmHg to 170/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal ventilation. The patient is receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions, along with other ICU medications such as heparin sodium, famotidine, vecuronium, and ASA.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. His flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of +3,484 mL in and -1,355 mL out, resulting in a total balance of +2,129 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen via an endotracheal tube and is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M admitted with acute CVA now transferred to the ICU with
   respiratory failure in the setting of a likely aspiration.
   Resp Failure:  Aspiration.  Persistent fevers and worsening infiltrates
   today suggest pneumonia vs pneumonitis.
     -Will continue with empiric Vanco/Ceftaz until cultures are
   finalized.
     -Pulmonary toilet
     -Given copious secretions and possible impaired gag, will likely need
   better pulmonary toilet before extubation is possible.  Therefore,
   likely no extubation today.
   CVA:  Continues on ASA.
   Decreased HCT:  Possibly dilutional.  Now stable
   Hematuria:  Now resolved.  Likely related to traumatic foley placement.
    Aspiration risk:  PEG tube placed today.   If recurrent aspiration is
   a problem in the future, need to consider tracheostomy.
   Hemodynamics:  Currently normotensive.  Neurology would prefer SBP's
   110-180.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male who was admitted with an acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and now has respiratory failure due to aspiration. He has been transferred to the ICU, where he continues to have persistent fevers and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia or pneumonitis. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He is currently sedated and intubated with an endotracheal tube, receiving mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration, which can lead to further lung damage and pneumonia. Continued secretions and impaired gag reflex may require better pulmonary toilet before extubation.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray suggests pneumonia. Empiric antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin and Ceftazidime should be continued until culture results are finalized.

3. CVA: The patient's acute CVA may result in neurological deficits. Continued use of aspirin (ASA) is indicated for cerebroprotection.

4. Hematuria: Although resolved, the patient experienced hematuria likely related to traumatic foley catheter placement. Care should be taken during future catheterizations.

5. Aspiration Risk: The placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may increase the risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke who was initially admitted to the Neuro ICU for aspiration. He has now been transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient underwent a PEG placement, which was uneventful. However, he developed fever and worsening left lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. 

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ceftazidime) and is planned for a bronchoscopy to obtain culture data and evaluate the airways. Sputum and blood cultures are pending. The PEG tube placement appears to be without complications based on the recent chest X-ray. 

The patient also has a history of right pontine infarction, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypertension (HTN), anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he requires ICU level of care."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke who was initially in the Neuro ICU and has been transferred for aspiration. The patient's fever and worsening left lung infiltrates indicate aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ceftazidime) for pneumonia and is being monitored for fever, blood cultures, and sputum cultures. The patient also has a PEG tube placed for nutrition and is being followed up with Neurology recommendations for the pontine infarction. Other conditions include possible UTI, hypertension, anemia, and resolved acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's worsening left lung infiltrates suggest aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's endotracheal tube placement, there is a risk of developing VAP due to bacterial colonization and infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased circulation in the legs can increase the risk of DVT formation.
4. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and ICU stay can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), and nitrites in the urine suggests a possible UTI.

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke who was initially in the Neuro ICU and transferred for aspiration. He had a PEG tube placed without complications, but his condition worsened with another temperature spike and worsening left lung infiltrates, consistent with aspiration pneumonia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 101.8Â°F, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 130/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. He has been receiving midazolam, fentanyl, vecuronium, famotidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 183 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 115 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T level of <0.01.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to a likely aspiration event. He has a history of stroke, and his current condition includes persistent fevers, pneumonia, and transient ischemic attack (TIA). The patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory complications if not properly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if adequate oxygenation and ventilation are not maintained.
3. Stroke/TIA: The patient has a history of stroke and recent TIA, indicating an increased risk of cerebrovascular events. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further neurological complications.
4. Fever: Persistent fevers indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. It is important to identify the source of infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper airway management and weaning strategies should be implemented to minimize this risk.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: Given the PEG insertion, there is a potential for gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration, diarrhea, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure following a likely aspiration event. He has a history of stroke and was recently undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. The patient's current condition includes persistent fevers, pneumonia due to aspiration, and transient ischemic attack (TIA). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.8Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 126/49-147/61 mmHg, heart rate between 71-100 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 13 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. His respiratory system compliance is noted as good.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. No abnormalities are noted in the cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, or abdominal area. Neurological examination shows that the patient follows simple commands and responds appropriately, but further assessments such as movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes are not documented.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 183 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein level of 28 mg/d"

   events:
   - around 11pm, patient had bright red hematuria with clots. Tried CBI
   but catheter clotted quickly. Called urology who recommended a 22g
   Cuday which was placed with some return initially. At this time,
   patient began to hyperventilate and rigor. Unclear etiology. Abdominal
   exam significant for pelvic distention, likely bladder. Sent for CTA
   chest, abd/pelvis with contrast at 2am which revealed a distended
   bladder with the balloon of the catheter in the penile urethra with
   evidence of urethral trauma, as well as the PEG tube likely piercing
   through the transverse colon.
           - general surgery aware and will get KUB to evaluate for
   extravasation once oral contrast reaches colon
           - urology came in and used the cystostocopy to clean out the
   bladder. They have left recs for foley care and flushing.
           - ABG showed respiratory alkalosis with more hypoxia. FiO2
   increased to 0.50. CTA negative for large PE. After procedures
   finished, patient's breathing settled out and he became more

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications. The following are some of the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing difficulty breathing due to factors such as pneumonia or aspiration.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. This could be a result of the patient's inability to protect their own airway, leading to the inhalation of gastric contents.

3. Urethral Trauma: The patient underwent a cystostomy procedure, which revealed a distended bladder with the balloon of the catheter in the penile urethra. This indicates a potential injury to the urethra, possibly caused by the insertion of the catheter.

4. Colonic Perforation: The CTA revealed evidence of the PEG tube piercing through the transverse colon. This suggests a possible perforation of the colon, potentially leading to the spread of bacteria and infection.

5. Gouty Flare: The patient is experiencing acute gouty flare in multiple joints, including the right elbow, left and right MCPs, and right IP on the great toe. This indicates an inflammatory condition characterized by sudden and severe joint pain.

6. Fever and Hypoxia: The patient's fever and low oxygen saturation levels indicate an ongoing infection"

   events:
   - around 11pm, patient had bright red hematuria with clots. Tried CBI
   but catheter clotted quickly. Called urology who recommended a 22g
   Cuday which was placed with some return initially. At this time,
   patient began to hyperventilate and rigor. Unclear etiology. Abdominal
   exam significant for pelvic distention, likely bladder. Sent for CTA
   chest, abd/pelvis with contrast at 2am which revealed a distended
   bladder with the balloon of the catheter in the penile urethra with
   evidence of urethral trauma, as well as the PEG tube likely piercing
   through the transverse colon.
           - general surgery aware and will get KUB to evaluate for
   extravasation once oral contrast reaches colon
           - urology came in and used the cystostocopy to clean out the
   bladder. They have left recs for foley care and flushing.
           - ABG showed respiratory alkalosis with more hypoxia. FiO2
   increased to 0.50. CTA negative for large PE. After procedures
   finished, patient's breathing settled out and he became more
   comfortable. Abdominal exam improved.
           - 500cc bolus at 7am for borderline BP's.
           - patient defervesced around 3am
   - bronchoscopy [**2141-1-18**] revealed thick, aggressive secretions in the

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and was found to have thick, aggressive secretions in the left mainstem bronchus and lower lobe bronchi, along with tracheomalacia extending to the second generation airways. The patient also experienced acute gouty flare in multiple joints and had a distended bladder with the balloon of the catheter in the penile urethra, resulting in urethral trauma. The PEG tube was also found to have pierced through the transverse colon. The patient's respiratory alkalosis with hypoxia improved after increasing the FiO2 to 0.50, and the breathing settled out. The patient's abdominal exam improved as well. The patient received bolus sedation, which improved mental status but did not produce a gag reflex. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5Â°F, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 110/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support since admission. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's medical history is significant for pneumonia, aspiration, respiratory failure, transient ischemic attack, and no known drug allergies. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has shown signs of infection with a fever and thick secretions in the bronchi, which may indicate pneumonia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support, indicating acute respiratory failure.
3. Urethral Trauma: The patient has a distended bladder with the balloon of the catheter in the penile urethra, causing urethral trauma.
4. Colonic Perforation: The PEG tube has pierced through the transverse colon, which can lead to colonic perforation.
5. Gouty Flare: The patient is experiencing an acute gouty flare in multiple joints, causing pain and inflammation.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension.
7. Hypoxia: The patient has low oxygen saturation levels, indicating hypoxia.
8. Thromboembolic Disease: The elevated D-dimer level suggests a possible thromboembolic disease.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium and phosphorus, are outside the normal range.
10. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: There is a possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the colonic perforation and potential extravasation of contrast."

   bladder with the balloon of the catheter in the penile urethra with
   evidence of urethral trauma, as well as the PEG tube likely piercing
   through the transverse colon.
           - general surgery aware and will get KUB to evaluate for
   extravasation once oral contrast reaches colon
           - urology came in and used the cystostocopy to clean out the
   bladder. They have left recs for foley care and flushing.
           - ABG showed respiratory alkalosis with more hypoxia. FiO2
   increased to 0.50. CTA negative for large PE. After procedures
   finished, patient's breathing settled out and he became more
   comfortable. Abdominal exam improved.
           - 500cc bolus at 7am for borderline BP's.
           - patient defervesced around 3am
   - bronchoscopy [**2141-1-18**] revealed thick, aggressive secretions in the
   left mainstem bronchus and LLL bronchi with tracheomalacia extending to
   second generation airways.
   - switched to bolus sedation, mental status improved, but still no gag.
   - increased peep to 8 for better lung expansion
   - right arm pain - on closer inspection seems to have acute gouty flare
   in multiple joints - right elbow left and right MCP's, right IP on
   great toe. Stopped allopurinol and initiated colchicine.
   - PT c/s saw patient, sat him up - did not follow commands as well as
   they expected.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient had a bronchoscopy performed on [**2141-1-18**] which revealed thick, aggressive secretions in the left mainstem bronchus and LLL bronchi with tracheomalacia extending to second-generation airways. The patient also experienced an acute gouty flare in multiple joints. He developed fever and hypoxia, and a CTA revealed a distended bladder with the balloon of the catheter in the penile urethra with evidence of urethral trauma, as well as the PEG tube likely piercing through the transverse colon. The patient underwent a cystoscopy to clean out the bladder and was found to have respiratory alkalosis with hypoxia. His breathing improved after procedures were finished, and he became more comfortable. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 0.50. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has pneumonia and tracheomalacia, which may lead to worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Urethral Trauma: The patient's bladder catheterization resulted in the balloon entering the penile urethra, causing trauma. This can lead to urinary tract infections or bleeding.
3. Colonic"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 yom with recent right pontine stroke who was initially in
   the Neuro ICU who was transferred for aspiration. Now s/p PEG placement
   course complicated by aspiration pneumonia, now with new foley trauma,
   acute renal failure, and peg misplacement leading to respiratory
   distress and relative hypotension.
   .
   # Relative hypotension, tachypnea: overnight, patient
s bladder
   distention likely caused significant distress. After urology flushed
   bladder, tachypnea settled out. ?initial respiratory acidosis, early
   sepsis. Findings of peg through transverse colon are concerning for new
   source of bacterial seeding, however general surgery feels that if no
   leak then this is safe to keep in place. CTA negative for PE. No
   obvious abscess or collection on abd CT from last night. There was some
   concern with the profuse urethral bleeding that he was in DIC/sepsis,
   but DIC labs were more c/w acute inflammation.
   -          KUB to look for extravasation
   -          General Surgery recs
   -          Serial abdominal exams
   -          Follow lactate
   -          IVF, blood products per early goal directed therapy
   -          Will need CVL today; once in place obtain CvO2 sat, maintain
   MAP>65, CVP 10-12
   -          Vanco/meropenem
   -          Follow up official read of CT abd/pelvis and KUB
   .
   # Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory failure: After initial clinical
   improvement and clearing of CXR findings of pneumonitis, the pt began
   spiking fevers and developed worsening left lung infiltrates consistent
   with aspiration pneumonia.
   -  Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem
   -- Bronchoscopy yesterday found LLL collapse; cultures are pending
   microorganisms on gram stain
   -- f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures

   - changed sedation to bolus form to lighten sedation, but overnight had
   to increase again in the acute setting
   - continue pulmonary toileting

   # GU
 significant urethral trauma ?secondary to foley trauma, although
   initial bright red blood was seemingly unprovoked. Appreciate urology
   recs. Continue to flush as advised.

   -- cont asa, statin
   -- cont SSI for glucose control
   -- allow BP to autoregulate with SBP 110-180

   -- cont meropenem
   -- urine cultures 1/27 no growth, [**1-16**] no growth
   .
   # HTN: hold BP meds as above, allow to autoregulate
   .
   # Anemia:  stabilized, ?from hematuria and IVF.
   .
   # ARF: initially resolved with fluid, likely from dehydration; now
   creatinine has bumped again in the acute setting. Possibly a
   combination of postrenal obstruction from clots and back bleeding plus
   insensible losses leading to prerenal azotemia. Creatinine recheck this
   morning is already trending downwards.
   -          continue IVF
   -          ensure foley patency

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke who initially presented with aspiration pneumonia. The patient's current conditions include Foley trauma, acute renal failure, and peg misplacement leading to respiratory distress and relative hypotension. The patient also has anemia, hypertension, and aspiration pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing fever spikes and worsening left lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. This indicates an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, suggesting impaired kidney function. If left untreated, acute renal failure can progress to chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease.

3. Foley trauma: The patient has significant urethral trauma due to Foley catheter placement. This can lead to ongoing bleeding or recurrent urinary tract infections.

4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation with aspiration pneumonia has worsened, indicating a potential progression of the infection. If not properly managed, this can result in further respiratory complications such as respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

5. Hypotension: The patient's relative hypotension may indicate inadequate perfusion to vital organs. If not corrected, it can lead to organ dysfunction or failure.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to chronic blood loss"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure in the setting of likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient has multiple medical complications including fever, hypoxemia, lactic acidosis, hematuria/urethral trauma, a peg tube traversing through the transverse colon, gout flare, hypotension, and new renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. This condition can worsen if not properly managed.

2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection such as fever, leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis. If the infection spreads or if the patient develops sepsis, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.

3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 1.8, indicating possible renal failure. This can be due to various factors such as contrast-induced nephropathy, obstructive uropathy, or prerenal azotemia. Proper management is crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and is currently on ASA for cerebrovascular prophylaxis. There is a risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina, especially in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of denied pain on daily awakening. The patient has been experiencing clots through a foley catheter, but his blood pressure has remained stable, so central venous pressure monitoring has been deferred. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and continues to have a fever curve trending down. He also received an additional dose of colchicine last night. Allergies were obtained from previous hospital records, and there are no known drug allergies. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were administered on 01/19/2141 at various times.

Infusions and Medications:
The patient is receiving famotidine (Pepcid) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include unspecified ICU medications.

Review of Systems:
The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital Signs:
The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), current temperature of 37.8Â°C (100Â°F), heart rate of 78 bpm with a range of 70-93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/44 mmHg to 154/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute with a range of 23-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

   concern with the profuse urethral bleeding that he was in DIC/sepsis,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old individual who recently experienced a right pontine stroke. Initially admitted to the Neuro ICU, the patient was transferred to the ICU due to aspiration. The patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement but developed complications such as aspiration pneumonia, new Foley trauma, acute renal failure, and misplacement of the PEG leading to respiratory distress and relative hypotension.

The patient presented with relative hypotension and tachypnea overnight, which was likely caused by bladder distention. After the bladder was flushed by urology, the tachypnea settled. The findings of the misplaced PEG through the transverse colon are concerning for a new source of bacterial seeding. However, general surgery feels that if there is no leak, it is safe to keep the PEG in place. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), and no obvious abscess or collection was found on the abdominal CT from the previous night. There was some concern about the profuse urethral bleeding, but disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs indicated acute inflammation rather than DIC.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Relative hypotension and tachypnea: The patient's bladder distention likely caused significant distress. After urology flushed the bladder, the tachypnea settled out. The initial respiratory acid"

   # Relative hypotension, tachypnea: likely secondary to pain from
   urethral trauma and marked bladder distention. Has done well throughout
   the day yesterday and overnight. Pressures held, so CVL deferred.
   Abdominal exams were stable.  Peg tube per surgery is okay to use. No

   improvement and clearing of CXR findings of pneumonitis, the pt began
   spiking fevers and developed worsening left lung infiltrates consistent
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Sputum is growing MRSA repeatedly. No need
   to keep meropenem on for now, will switch to cipro/flagyl today. Move
   to extubate if urology not planning any procedures.
   -- SBT with attempt to extubate this afternoon.
   -- Continue Vancomycin, cipro, flagyl until [**1-25**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke, initially in the Neuro ICU, transferred for aspiration. The patient has undergone a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, complicated by aspiration pneumonia, new Foley trauma, acute renal failure, and peg misplacement leading to respiratory distress and relative hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Relative hypotension and tachypnea due to pain from urethral trauma and marked bladder distention.
2. Aspiration pneumonia with worsening left lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Sputum is growing MRSA repeatedly.
3. Persistent fevers, unclear cause, possibly secondary to acute gouty flare or stress ulceration.
4. Coffee grounds from OG tube, likely stress ulceration.
5. Significant urethral trauma secondary to Foley trauma.
6. Acute renal failure initially resolved with fluid, now creatinine has bumped again in the acute setting. Possibly a combination of postrenal obstruction from clots and back bleeding plus insensible losses leading to prerenal azotemia.
7. Right hemi-pontine infarction.
8. Urinary tract infection (UTI) with UA showing WBC, RBC, and nitrites consistent with possible UTI.
9. Hypertension.
10. Anemia requiring blood transfusion.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. He has a history of fever, hematuria, stroke, and recent surgery involving a peg tube that traverses the colon. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 100.3Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 139/56 to 154/69 mmHg, heart rate between 70-85 bpm, respiratory rate of 23-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 518 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, responsive to verbal commands, with poor dentition and minimal gag reflex. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are present. Respiratory examination demonstrates absent breath sounds at the bases of the lungs, with the rest being clear. Abdominal examination reveals a distended abdomen, and Foley catheter drainage is showing dark blood. Neurologic examination shows the patient is wide awake and responds to all commands.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 152 mg/dL, and elevated lact"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. He also has a history of stroke (TIA), severe hematuria, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been treated with various medications including heparin, ASA, meropenem, and antibiotics. His vital signs are stable, and his fever has improved. The patient's condition remains critical, and his code status is currently set to full code, but a family meeting is planned to discuss making him DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further lung damage.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's risk of developing aspiration pneumonia may increase if proper precautions are not taken during feeding or if there is a failure in maintaining the correct head-of-bed (HOB) elevation.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's severe hematuria and coffee grounds in the peg tube suggest a possible UTI. This could lead to urinary tract complications if not properly managed.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may recur or worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed. Monitoring of hemodynamic stability and close observation for signs of bleeding are essential.

5. Stroke: The patient's history of TIA increases the risk of subsequent strokes."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes a recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), for which he was given aspirin (ASA). He also has a fever, leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis, and there are concerns about hypoxemia, left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate, gout flare, hypotension, bicarb drop, mild sepsis, new renal failure, and no gag reflex.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. There is a concern for worsening respiratory failure, and the need to increase PEEP and follow up with a chest X-ray.

2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis indicated by fever, leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis. Proper fluid management and antibiotic therapy will be crucial to prevent further deterioration.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen from 1.0 to 1.8, indicating potential renal failure. This could be due to contrast-induced nephropathy, obstructive uropathy, or insensible losses. Appropriate measures should be taken to address this issue.

4. Gout Flare: The patient is experiencing a gout flare, and appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 yom with recent right pontine stroke who was initially in
   the Neuro ICU who was transferred for aspiration. Now s/p PEG placement
   course complicated by aspiration pneumonia, now with new foley trauma,
   acute renal failure, and peg misplacement leading to respiratory
   distress and relative hypotension.
   # Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory failure: After initial clinical
   improvement and clearing of CXR findings of pneumonitis, the pt began
   spiking fevers and developed worsening left lung infiltrates consistent
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Cont Vanco for MRSA in sputum.  Patient was
   successfully extubated after our [**Hospital **] medical rounds.  Doing well.
   -- Continue Vancomycin, cipro, flagyl until [**1-25**].
   -- f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   -- trend fever curve
   -- continue pulmonary toilet
   # Persistent Fevers: unclear. Sputum persistenly growing MRSA. Could
   also be secondary to acute gouty flare.  Will cont abx as above
   # Coffee Grounds from OG tube: ppi [**Hospital1 **], likely stress ulceration.  No
   coffee grounds overnight and HCT stable
   # Hematuria:  patient will hematoma in bladder likely from foley
   trauma.  Urology consulted and recommended CBI.  Urine is now clear.
   Will clamp CBI catheter.  d/c tomorrow if urine remains clear
   # ARF: resolved
   -          continue IVF
   -          ensure foley patency
   # Right Hemi-Pontine Infarction:
   -- f/u Neurology recs
   -- cont asa, statin
   -- cont SSI for glucose control
   -- allow BP to autoregulate with SBP 110-180
   # HTN: hold BP meds as above, allow to autoregulate.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke who was initially in the Neuro ICU and was transferred for aspiration. The patient's course has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia, Foley trauma, acute renal failure, and misplacement of PEG leading to respiratory distress and relative hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient initially showed improvement after being extubated, but then developed worsening left lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole until January 25th. It is important to follow up with sputum cultures, blood cultures, trend fever curve, and continue pulmonary toilet.

2. Persistent Fevers: The cause of the persistent fevers is unclear, and it could be secondary to acute gouty flare or infection. The patient will continue with the same antibiotics as above.

3. Coffee Grounds from OG Tube: The patient had coffee grounds from the OG tube, which was likely due to stress ulceration. There were no coffee grounds overnight, and the hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is stable.

4. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria, which was likely caused by a hematoma in the bladder from Foley trauma. Urology consulted and recommended a Catheterized Bladder Inspection (CBI). The urine is now clear, and the C"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 yom with recent right pontine stroke who was initially in
   the Neuro ICU who was transferred for aspiration. Now s/p PEG placement
   course complicated by aspiration pneumonia, now with new foley trauma,
   acute renal failure, and peg misplacement leading to respiratory
   distress and relative hypotension.
   .
   # Relative hypotension, tachypnea: likely secondary to pain from
   urethral trauma and marked bladder distention. Has done well throughout
   the day yesterday and overnight. Pressures held, so CVL deferred.
   Abdominal exams were stable.  Peg tube per surgery is okay to use. No
   evidence of extravasation on CT or subsequent KUB.
   .
   # Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory failure: After initial clinical
   improvement and clearing of CXR findings of pneumonitis, the pt began
   spiking fevers and developed worsening left lung infiltrates consistent
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Sputum is growing MRSA repeatedly. No need
   to keep meropenem on for now, will switch to cipro/flagyl today. Move
   to extubate if urology not planning any procedures.
   -- SBT with attempt to extubate this afternoon.
   -- Continue Vancomycin, cipro, flagyl until [**1-25**].
   -- CXR today shows clearing of the LLL
   -- f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   -- trend fever curve
   -- continue to keep unsedated, bolus as necessary
   -- continue pulmonary toilet
   .
   # Persistent Fevers: unclear. Sputum persistenly growing MRSA. Could
   also be secondary to acute gouty flare.
   .
   # Coffee Grounds from OG tube: ppi [**Hospital1 **], likely stress ulceration.
   .
   # GU
 significant urethral trauma ?secondary to foley trauma, although
   initial bright red blood was seemingly unprovoked. Appreciate urology
   recs. Continue to flush as advised.
   .
   # ARF: initially resolved with fluid, likely from dehydration; now
   creatinine has bumped again in the acute setting. Possibly a
   combination of postrenal obstruction from clots and back bleeding plus
   insensible losses leading to prerenal azotemia. Creatinine recheck this
   morning is already trending downwards.
   -          continue IVF
   -          ensure foley patency
   .
   # Right Hemi-Pontine Infarction:
   -- f/u Neurology recs
   -- cont asa, statin
   -- cont SSI for glucose control
   -- allow BP to autoregulate with SBP 110-180
    .
   # UTI:  UA with WBC, RBC, Nitrites consistent with possible UTI
   -- cont meropenem
   -- urine cultures 1/27 no growth, [**1-16**] no growth
   .
   # HTN: hold BP meds as above, allow to autoregulate
   .
   # Anemia: needed 3 units overnight from GU bleed. Continue to monitor,
   recheck tonight.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke. The patient was initially admitted to the Neuro ICU and then transferred to the ICU due to aspiration. The patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, which was complicated by aspiration pneumonia.

The patient also experienced new Foley trauma, acute renal failure, and misplacement of the PEG tube leading to respiratory distress and relative hypotension. The patient's current conditions include relative hypotension, tachypnea (likely secondary to pain from urethral trauma and marked bladder distention), aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers and has developed worsening left lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. The sputum is growing MRSA repeatedly, indicating a possible ongoing infection.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels. This could be due to postrenal obstruction from clots and back bleeding, as well as insensible losses leading to prerenal azotemia.

3. Urethral Trauma: The patient has significant urethral trauma secondary to Foley trauma. This could lead to further complications if not managed properly.

4. Anemia: The patient required 3 units of blood overnight due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Continuous monitoring and rechecking"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old man with CVA, course complicated by aspiration pneumonia.
   Plan as per resident note. Briefly, doing well on SBT this morning.
   Will check gas and clarify wishes on re-intubation
   prior to attempt at extubation today. Persistent fever on appropriate
   abx for MRSA pneumonia. also covered for intraabdominal source given
   PEG complication, but surgery following with no indication for
   intervention and no imaging or exam evidence of peritonitis. Will check
   c. diff today, f/u cultures and continue current abx. Further plans as
   per resident note.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 yom with recent right pontine stroke who was initially in
   the Neuro ICU who was transferred for aspiration. Now s/p PEG placement
   course complicated by aspiration pneumonia, now with new foley trauma,
   acute renal failure, and peg misplacement leading to respiratory
   distress and relative hypotension.
   # Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory failure: After initial clinical
   improvement and clearing of CXR findings of pneumonitis, the pt began
   spiking fevers and developed worsening left lung infiltrates consistent
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Cont Vanco for MRSA in sputum.  Patient was
   successfully extubated after our [**Hospital **] medical rounds.  Doing well.
   -- Continue Vancomycin, cipro, flagyl until [**1-25**].
   -- f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   -- trend fever curve
   -- continue pulmonary toilet
   # Persistent Fevers: unclear. Sputum persistenly growing MRSA. Could
   also be secondary to acute gouty flare.  Will cont abx as above
   # Coffee Grounds from OG tube: ppi [**Hospital1 **], likely stress ulceration.  No
   coffee grounds overnight and HCT stable
   # Hematuria:  patient will hematoma in bladder likely from foley
   trauma.  Urology consulted and recommended CBI.  Urine is now clear.
   Will clamp CBI catheter.  d/c tomorrow if urine remains clear
   # ARF: resolved
   - continue IVF
   -  ensure foley patency
   # Right Hemi-Pontine Infarction:
   -- f/u Neurology recs
   -- cont asa, statin
   -- cont SSI for glucose control
   -- allow BP to autoregulate with SBP 110-180
   # HTN: hold BP meds as above, allow to autoregulate.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old individual with a recent right pontine stroke. They were initially in the Neuro ICU and were transferred for aspiration. The patient has had a complicated course involving aspiration pneumonia, new Foley trauma, acute renal failure, and peg misplacement leading to respiratory distress and relative hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient had initial clinical improvement and clearing of CXR findings of pneumonitis, but then developed worsening left lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being treated with Vancomycin, Cipro, and Flagyl, and will continue these medications until January 25th. They will also be monitored for sputum and blood cultures, their fever curve will be trended, and pulmonary toilet will be continued.

2. Persistent Fevers: The cause of the patient's persistent fevers is unclear. It could be due to MRSA in the sputum or secondary to an acute gouty flare. Antibiotics will be continued as above.

3. Coffee Grounds from OG tube: The patient had coffee grounds from the OG tube, which was likely caused by stress ulceration. This has been addressed, and no further incidents occurred overnight. Hematocrit levels are stable.

4. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria, likely caused by a hematoma in the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a recent right pontine stroke, initially in the Neuro ICU and transferred for aspiration. The patient underwent PEG placement, which was complicated by aspiration pneumonia, Foley trauma, acute renal failure, and peg misplacement leading to respiratory distress and relative hypotension. 

The patient had initial clinical improvement and clearing of CXR findings of pneumonitis, but then began spiking fevers and developed worsening left lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole were started for MRSA in sputum. The patient was successfully extubated after rounds. 

The patient also had persistent fevers, which could be secondary to acute gouty flare or stress ulceration from PPI use. Hematuria occurred due to a hematoma in the bladder likely from Foley trauma. Urology consulted and recommended CBI. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved. 

The patient has a right hemi-pontine infarction and hypertension. Neurology recommendations include following up with their recommendations, continuing ASA and statin, continuing SSI for glucose control, and allowing BP to autoregulate with SBP 110-180. 

Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient initially improved but then developed worsening lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Vancomycin was started for MRSA in sputum. The patient's condition needs"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old individual who has experienced a right pontine stroke and was initially admitted to the Neuro ICU. The patient was later transferred to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia, new Foley trauma, acute renal failure, and misplacement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, leading to respiratory distress and relative hypotension. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is showing clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is at high risk of recurrent aspiration events due to recent stroke. It is crucial to continue aggressive pulmonary toilet and aspiration precautions to prevent further respiratory issues.

2. Persistent Fevers: The patient's persistent fevers may be attributed to the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the sputum. Vancomycin therapy should be continued until [**1-25**]. It is also important to trend the fever curve and monitor for any signs of improvement.

3. Coffee Grounds from OG Tube: The presence of coffee grounds from the oral gastric (OG) tube indicates possible stress ulceration. Monitoring for any recurrence of coffee grounds and maintaining hemodynamic stability is necessary.

4. Hematuria: The patient has experienced hematuria, which could be due to a hematoma in the bladder from"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a pontine stroke, course complicated by aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. He was extubated yesterday and is now requiring minimal supplemental oxygen. The patient has agreed to be DNR/DNI. His fevers have resolved, and the plan is to transfer him from the ICU today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, which could potentially recur if there are any complications or if his respiratory status worsens.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory complications and infection if proper precautions are not taken.
3. Stroke Complications: The patient has a pontine stroke, which can result in various neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or changes in consciousness.
4. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics for his aspiration pneumonia, but he still remains at risk for developing other infections, especially since he is in the ICU.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and advanced age increase the risk of developing DVTs, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.
6. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis due to his critical illness, and he may still be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP"
