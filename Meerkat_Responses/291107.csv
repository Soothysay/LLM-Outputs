","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of untreated Hepatitis C, likely cirrhosis, portal gastropathy, and grade I varices. He was recently hospitalized for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and presented with persistent abdominal pain, apparent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and worsening anemia. The patient had a reported maroon colored stool, and his hemoglobin level decreased despite receiving a blood transfusion. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Imaging reveals increased ascites, persistent wall thickening and edema of the ascending and transverse colon, as well as new worsened edema involving the stomach and proximal small bowel without perforation, obstruction, or abscess. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: unclear source of blood loss at this time.
2. Abdominal pain/recent C. diff infection: patient continues to report abdominal pain with imaging demonstrating bowel wall edema. C. Diff negative x 1.
3. EtOH abuse: intoxicated on admission.
4. Presumed cirrhosis - h/o EtOH abuse and Hepatitis C.
5. Other plans and orders are noted in the progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Continued or worsening gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Development of hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function.
- Progression of ascites and potential complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- Increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression from cirrhosis and recent C. diff infection.
- Possible development of hepatorenal syndrome due to worsening liver function and renal impairment.
- Continued abdominal pain and discomfort.
- Potential need for paracentesis due to worsening ascites and GI bleed.
- Further evaluation and management of the patient's alcohol abuse history.
- Monitoring and management of the patient's nutritional status.
- Close monitoring of the patient's coagulation profile."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of untreated hepatitis C, likely cirrhosis, portal gastropathy, and grade I varices. He has been admitted to the ICU for recent hospitalization due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which caused persistent abdominal pain, apparent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and worsening anemia.

The patient's current chief complaint is new onset sharp abdominal pain on the left side, on top of chronic diffuse abdominal pain. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/85 mmHg to 132/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 165,000/mmÂ³, blood glucose level of 65 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The imaging findings reveal increased ascites, persistent wall thickening and edema of the ascending and transverse colon, worsened edema involving the stomach and proximal small bowel, but no perforation, obstruction, or abscess.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute blood loss anemia, abdominal pain, and recent C. diff infection. The acute blood loss anemia is likely due to GI bleeding, which was confirmed by a recent endoscopy showing grade I varices. The patient has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but continues to have a declining hemoglobin level.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further GI bleeding due to the presence of grade I varices and worsening anemia. The abdominal pain could be related to bowel edema seen on imaging and previous C. diff infection. The patient also has a history of EtOH abuse, which may contribute to presumed cirrhosis and associated complications such as portal hypertension and increased risk of GI bleeding.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and history, the potential medical complications to consider are:

1. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of grade I varices and recent evidence of GI bleed. There is a risk of re-bleeding or progression of bleeding, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and require urgent intervention.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, especially with worsening liver function and increased ascites.

3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has increased ascites, which increases the risk of SBP,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of untreated Hepatitis C virus (HCV), likely cirrhosis, portal gastropathy, and grade I varices. The patient was recently hospitalized for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which caused persistent abdominal pain, apparent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and worsening anemia.

The patient's current symptoms include new-onset sharp abdominal pain on the left side, on top of chronic diffuse abdominal pain. No radiation of pain could be identified, and the patient cannot elaborate further on the pain. The patient is still experiencing abdominal pain despite negative C. diff test results.

Imaging studies show increased ascites, persistent wall thickening and edema of the ascending and transverse colon, with new worsening edema involving the stomach and proximal small bowel. There is no evidence of perforation, obstruction, or abscess.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood glucose level is well-controlled.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 4.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 168 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 3.2 mmol/L. Other lab values such as liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical history includes untreated HCV, cirrhosis, portal gastropathy, grade I varices, recent hospitalization for C. diff infection, GI bleed, and worsening anemia. The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse and was intoxicated on admission. Thiamine and folic acid supplementation have been initiated, and a social work consult has been requested.

The patient's current plan includes continuing IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for GI bleed, following hepatology recommendations, and consulting with gastroenterology regarding CT results and possible colitis. Antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin has been initiated for worsening ascites in the setting of GI bleeding. The possibility of paracentesis is being considered due to continued worsening abdominal pain in the setting of worsening ascites and now GI bleed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleed, and despite treatment with PPI, the source of the bleed is still unclear. Continued monitoring of hematocrit levels and trend analysis is necessary to assess the severity of anemia and the need for further blood transfusion.

2. C. diff infection: Although the patient's C. diff test results are negative,"

   maintain BBS, check HCT q8h, keep HCT >25. Will monitor coags and try
   to keep INR <2, fibrinogen >100. For probable untreated c. diff, will
   treat with PO vanco. Abd pain stable, low dose morphine. Will ADAT
   unless she has signs of acute bleed or is scheduled for EGD. Will trend

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of untreated Hepatitis C, likely cirrhosis, portal gastropathy, and grade I varices. She was recently hospitalized for Clostridium difficile colitis and now presents with persistent abdominal pain, apparent gastrointestinal bleed, and worsening anemia. 

24-hour events include an abdominal Doppler that showed hepatic cirrhosis, patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow direction, small amount of ascites, and a renal cyst. An IR-guided paracentesis was performed, which was not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and received a last dose of antibiotics on 08/24/2018 at 06:00 AM. She is currently on ICU medications and other medications. 

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Physical examination reveals a soft abdomen that is distended and tender to percussion, with no rebound or guarding. Extremities are negative for clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, and deep pain and pulses are 2+.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.5, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count of 168,000, blood glucose of 65 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 3.2 mmol/L. Other labs indicate possible liver dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies confirm hepatic cirrhosis and ascites.

Assessment and plan include managing acute blood loss anemia, abdominal pain, recent C. difficile infection, ethanol abuse, presumed cirrhosis, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further gastrointestinal bleeding, worsening of anemia, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, esophageal variceal bleeding, and respiratory complications due to impaired pulmonary function."
