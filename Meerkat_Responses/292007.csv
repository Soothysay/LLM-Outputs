   CXR: [**2118-5-20**]
   Somewhat limited study due to patient position and respiratory motion.
   Persitent right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity, possibly
   representing atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded.  Small left
   pleural effusion.  No CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, s/p PPM/ICD
   placement, afib who presents with 2 days onset of dyspnea and fever in
   ER.
   1) Fever: possible etiology includes PNA given dyspnea, bacteremia
   given HD patient, abdominal source, unlikely urinary since patient does
   not make urine.  Blood cultures 1 of 2 aerobic bottles grew gm+ cocci
   in pairs and clusters from peripheral puncture on [**5-19**] @9am.  This may
   represent contaminant as the most likely source would be expected to be
   the HD line, but will be in touch with renal re: speciation.
   -cont vanco/zosyn/azithro for HAP and possible legionella given fevers
   and dyspnea and inability to clearly view lung fields [**12-20**] to ICD
   (bilat) obscuring film.
   - blood cx (as above), sputum culture
   - trend LFTs
   - Will hold off on abdominal US to eval for cholelithiasis or
   obstruction though patient is s/p cholecystectomy given down trending
   LFT
   2) Hypoxia: Pt on O2 via NC.  No clear convincing evidence of PNA on
   CXR but as stated above film of limited utility.  Could be infectious,
   volume overload given need for HD or PE though less likely.
   - HD per renal for volume removal
   - antibiotics as above
   - sputum culture
   - consider chest CT if no improvement
   - BiPAP for now; wean as tolerated.  DNR/DNI confirmed
   - check ABG
   3) Hypotension:  Pt became hypotensive during the night with pressures
   in the 80
s/30
s which were transiently responsive to fluid initially
   and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small
   at only 250cc at a time).  Pt has HD catheter in place R subclavian
   which can be utilized as temporary access if need for immediate
   pressors.  Would prefer to have new independent line for pressor.
   Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, cardiogenic
   shock.
   - Continue fluid boluses to a max of volume removed at HD yesterday
   (2.5L)
   - Start levophed and titrate to MAP>45
   4) PVD: s/p angio by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9494**], discharged [**5-13**]
   - vascular to f/u patient
   - cont clopidogrel/ASA
   - monitor pulses
   - wound care consult for LE ulcers
   5) ESRD on HD: needs HD today. also with hyperkalemia without ECG
   changes
   - renal recs
   - cont nephrocaps
   6) CAD s/p CABG: CP free currently. no ECG changes. unlikely hypoxia to
   be secondary to ischemic event without symptoms or ECG changes
   - cont ASA
   - cont b-blocker
   7) Cirrhosis: thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis.  has AMS
   today of unclear cause per ER, but per wife, patient has had normal
   mental status and currently is completely clear.
   - ABG as above
   - lactulose for BMs; cont rifaximin
   - treat infection as above
   - consider diagnostic para for SBP
   8) Coagulopathy: Pt coagulopathic with INR 1.6 and bleeding from line
   sites.  Likely from liver failure.  Will give 2mg PO vit K and follow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented to the emergency room with a 2-day history of dyspnea and fever. In the ICU, he has been on non-invasive ventilation and started on dialysis catheter.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 84/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. He is in atrial fibrillation and has bibasilar crackles and scattered wheezes on lung examination. The abdomen is soft, distended, and positive for bowel sounds with a fluid wave. There is no edema or rash observed. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is alert and oriented, with movement of all extremities without difficulty.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 2.5 mg/dL, low albumin at 3.0 g/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 174 IU/L. The chest X-ray shows a right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia. Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Fever: Possible etiology includes pneumonia, bacteremia, or abdominal source. Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci, possibly representing a contaminant from the hemodialysis line. Continue vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and azithromycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and possible Legionella infection. Obtain sputum culture and trend liver function tests (LFTs).
2) Hypoxia: Patient on oxygen via nasal cannula. No clear evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. Could be infectious, volume overload, or pulmonary embolism (PE). Hemodialysis for volume removal, antibiotics as above, sputum culture, consider chest CT if no improvement, and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for now, weaning as tolerated. Confirm do-not-resuscitate (DNR) / do-not-intubate (DNI) status.
3) Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive with pressures in the 80s/30s, initially responsive to fluid boluses but then unresponsive. Utilize temporary access for hemodynamic support. Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, or cardiogenic shock. Continue fluid bol"

   pleural effusion.  No CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, s/p PPM/ICD
   placement, afib who presents with 2 days onset of dyspnea and fever in
   ER.
   1) Fever: possible etiology includes PNA given dyspnea, bacteremia
   given HD patient, abdominal source, unlikely urinary since patient does
   not make urine.  Blood cultures 1 of 2 aerobic bottles grew gm+ cocci
   in pairs and clusters from peripheral puncture on [**5-19**] @9am.  This may
   represent contaminant as the most likely source would be expected to be
   the HD line.
   - cont vanco/zosyn/azithro for HAP and possible legionella given fevers
   and dyspnea and inability to clearly view lung fields [**12-20**] to ICD
   (bilat) obscuring film.
   - blood cx (as above), sputum culture
   - trend LFTs
   - abdominal US to eval for cholelithiasis or obstruction given elevated
   t.bili though patient is s/p cholecystectomy
   2) Hypoxia: Pt on O2 via NC.  No clear convincing evidence of PNA on
   CXR but as stated above film of limited utility.  Could be infectious,
   volume overload given need for HD or PE though less likely.
   - HD per renal for volume removal
   - antibiotics as above
   - sputum culture
   - consider chest CT if no improvement
   - BiPAP for now; wean as tolerated.  DNR/DNI confirmed
   - check ABG
   3) Hypotension:  Pt became hypotensive during the night with pressures
   in the 80
s/30
s which were transiently responsive to fluid initially
   and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small
   at only 250cc at a time).  Pt has HD catheter in place R subclavian
   which can be utilized as temporary access if need for immediate
   pressors.  Would prefer to have new independent line for pressor.
   Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, cardiogenic
   shock.
   - Continue fluid boluses to a max of volume removed at HD yesterday
   (2.5L)
   - Start levophed and titrate to MAP>45
   4) PVD: s/p angio by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9494**], discharged [**5-13**]
   - vascular to f/u patient
   - cont clopidogrel/ASA
   - monitor pulses
   - wound care consult for LE ulcers
   5) ESRD on HD: needs HD today. also with hyperkalemia without ECG
   changes
   - renal recs
   - cont nephrocaps
   6) CAD s/p CABG: CP free currently. no ECG changes. unlikely hypoxia to
   be secondary to ischemic event without symptoms or ECG changes
   - cont ASA
   - cont b-blocker
   7) Cirrhosis: thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis.  has AMS
   today of unclear cause per ER, but per wife, patient has had normal
   mental status and currently is completely clear.
   - ABG as above
   - lactulose for BMs; cont rifaximin
   - treat infection as above
   - consider diagnostic para for SBP
   8) F/E/N: NPO for now while on BiPAP; replete lytes PRN
   9) PPx: hep sc, PPI
   12) Contact; wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9495**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient presents with dyspnea, fever, and hypoxia. Blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bloodstream infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which may be due to a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or bacteremia. The blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci, suggesting a bacterial infection.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is hypoxic and requires supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. There is no clear evidence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray, but there may be an infectious cause or volume overload contributing to the hypoxia.
3. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive during the night, unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses. This may be due to fluid reduction during HD, infection, or cardiogenic shock.
4. PVD: The patient has a history of PVD and had an angiogram done by Dr. [Last Name (Title)] on [Date]. The patient was discharged on [Date]. Vascular follow-up is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (PPM/ICD) placement. He presents with acute respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia (PNA) or possibly a non-infectious cause such as pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has fever and elevated liver enzymes. His renal function is impaired, and he requires HD. He has a history of cirrhosis secondary to steatohepatitis and acute mental status change of unclear cause. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and will be admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if he develops further pneumonia or if his current condition progresses. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support will be necessary.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires ongoing hemodialysis. Any further deterioration in renal function could lead to complications such as hyperkalemia, fluid overload, and acid-base imbalance.
3. Infection: Given the presence of fever and elevated liver enzymes, there is a possibility of an underlying infection. Prompt identification and treatment of any"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and bacteremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes acute respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and bacteremia. The patient's current medications include levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Fluid balance is within normal limits, with a total intake of 2,235 mL and output of 2,235 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood cultures were obtained from the hemodialysis line, which is suspected to be the source of bacteremia. The dialysis catheter was removed, and the patient will be started on appropriate antibiotic therapy.

   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular

   is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on
   the aortic valve. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   0.8-cm2). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
   filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a moderate sized (1.6 cm) pericardial effusion.
   The effusion appears loculated.
   IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Moderate
   global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe diastolic dysfunction
   and elevated filling pressures. Dilated right ventricle. Moderate
   pulmonary hypertension. Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate to severe
   tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate sized loculated pericardial effusion
   located posterior to the inferior wall.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, s/p PPM/ICD
   placement, afib who presents with 2 days onset of dyspnea and fever in
   ER.
   1) Fever:
   - 2 blood cultures growing out GPC
 one has been speciated at coag+
   staph aureus
   - echo showed no evidence of endocarditis
   - cont vanco/zosyn
   - f/u remaining cultures (including catheter tip)
   - trend LFTs
   - dialysis catheter tip pulled yesterday.
   - on vanc and rifaximin
 vanc level 8.1
 renal recommends giving 1gm
   vanc IV
   2) Hypoxia: Pt on O2 via NC.
   - continue to check ABG
   - improved, per pt
   - possibly get a PA and lateral chest film today to better evaluate for
   an infiltrate
   3) Hypotension:  Pt became hypotensive during the night with pressures
   in the 80
s/30
s which were transiently responsive to fluid initially
   and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small
   at only 250cc at a time).  Pt has HD catheter in place R subclavian
   which can be utilized as temporary access if need for immediate
   pressors.  Would prefer to have new independent line for pressor.
   Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, cardiogenic
   shock.
   - Continue fluid boluses to a max of volume removed at HD yesterday
   (2.5L)
   - Start levophed and titrate to MAP>45
   4) PVD: s/p angio by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9494**], discharged [**5-13**]
   - vascular to f/u patient
   - cont clopidogrel/ASA
   - monitor pulses
   - wound care consult for LE ulcers
   5) ESRD on HD: needs HD today. also with hyperkalemia without ECG
   changes
   - renal recs
   - cont nephrocaps
   6) CAD s/p CABG: CP free currently. no ECG changes. unlikely hypoxia to
   be secondary to ischemic event without symptoms or ECG changes
   - cont ASA
   - cont b-blocker
   7) Cirrhosis: thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis.  has AMS
   today of unclear cause per ER, but per wife, patient has had normal
   mental status and currently is completely clear.
   - ABG as above
   - lactulose for BMs; cont rifaximin
   - treat infection as above
   - consider diagnostic para for SBP
   8) Coagulopathy: Pt coagulopathic with INR 1.6 and bleeding from line
   sites.  Likely from liver failure.  Will give 2mg PO vit K and follow.

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presents with a 2-day history of dyspnea and fever. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 122/60 mmHg to 127/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is currently not on any anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci, including coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus. The echocardiogram reveals moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe diastolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures. There is also dilated right ventricle, moderate pulmonary hypertension, severe aortic stenosis, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, and a moderate-sized loculated pericardial effusion located posterior to the inferior wall. No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis is seen.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1) Fever: The patient has two blood cultures growing out GPC, one of which has been speciated as coag+ Staphylococcus aureus. The echocardiogram showed no evidence of endocarditis. The patient is to continue on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, follow-up remaining cultures (including catheter tip), trend liver function tests, and dialysis catheter tip was pulled yesterday.
2) Hypoxia: The patient is on oxygen via nasal cannula. He is to continue to check arterial blood gas, possibly get a chest film today to better evaluate for an infiltrate, and continue O2 therapy as needed.
3) Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive during the night with pressures in the 80s/30s, which were transiently responsive to fluid initially and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small at only 250cc at a time). The patient has a hemodialysis catheter in place right subclavian which can be utilized as temporary access if needed for immediate pressors. The patient prefers to have a new independent line for pressor. Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, or cardiogenic shock. The patient is to continue fluid boluses to a maximum of volume removed at HD yesterday (2.5L) and start levophed and titrate to mean arterial pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous CABG surgery, who presented to the emergency room with two days of dyspnea and fever. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by GPC coag+ staph aureus. The echocardiogram showed no evidence of endocarditis, but there were findings of severe aortic stenosis, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, and a moderate-sized loculated pericardial effusion located posterior to the inferior wall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's fever could indicate an ongoing infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is on oxygen via nasal cannula, indicating a possible respiratory issue that needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are low, indicating a potential need for fluid resuscitation or other interventions to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. PVD: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and has undergone angioplasty. It is important to monitor the patient's peripheral pulses and continue with appropriate medication management.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires ongoing dialysis treatment. The recent removal of the dial"

   Echo ([**5-21**])The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. There
   is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on
   the aortic valve. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   0.8-cm2). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
   filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a moderate sized (1.6 cm) pericardial effusion.
   The effusion appears loculated.
   IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Moderate
   global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe diastolic dysfunction
   and elevated filling pressures. Dilated right ventricle. Moderate
   pulmonary hypertension. Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate to severe
   tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate sized loculated pericardial effusion
   located posterior to the inferior wall.

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient presents with a two-day onset of dyspnea and fever in the emergency room. 

Echocardiogram results show no evidence of endocarditis, but there are several cardiac abnormalities. The left atrium is moderately dilated, and the estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%), and increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is also severe aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.8-cm2 and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. 

Blood cultures growing out GPC coag+ staph aureus, and the patient is already on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The dialysis catheter tip was pulled yesterday, and the patient is being monitored for remaining cultures, including the catheter tip. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Fever: possible etiology includes PNA given dyspnea, bacteremia
   given HD patient, abdominal source, unlikely urinary since patient does
   not make urine.  Blood cultures 1 of 2 aerobic bottles grew gm+ cocci
   in pairs and clusters from peripheral puncture on [**5-19**] @9am.  This may
   represent contaminant as the most likely source would be expected to be
   the HD line, but will be in touch with renal re: speciation.
   -cont vanco/zosyn/azithro for HAP and possible legionella given fevers
   and dyspnea and inability to clearly view lung fields [**12-20**] to ICD
   (bilat) obscuring film.
   - blood cx (as above), sputum culture
   - trend LFTs
   - Will hold off on abdominal US to eval for cholelithiasis or
   obstruction though patient is s/p cholecystectomy given down trending
   LFT
   2) Hypoxia: Pt on O2 via NC.  No clear convincing evidence of PNA on
   CXR but as stated above film of limited utility.  Could be infectious,
   volume overload given need for HD or PE though less likely.
   - HD per renal for volume removal
   - antibiotics as above
   - sputum culture
   - consider chest CT if no improvement
   - BiPAP for now; wean as tolerated.  DNR/DNI confirmed
   - check ABG
   3) Hypotension:  Pt became hypotensive during the night with pressures
   in the 80
s/30
s which were transiently responsive to fluid initially
   and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small
   at only 250cc at a time).  Pt has HD catheter in place R subclavian
   which can be utilized as temporary access if need for immediate
   pressors.  Would prefer to have new independent line for pressor.
   Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, cardiogenic
   shock.
   - Continue fluid boluses to a max of volume removed at HD yesterday
   (2.5L)
   - Start levophed and titrate to MAP>45
   4) PVD: s/p angio by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9494**], discharged [**5-13**]
   - vascular to f/u patient
   - cont clopidogrel/ASA
   - monitor pulses
   - wound care consult for LE ulcers
   5) ESRD on HD: needs HD today. also with hyperkalemia without ECG
   changes
   - renal recs
   - cont nephrocaps
   6) CAD s/p CABG: CP free currently. no ECG changes. unlikely hypoxia to
   be secondary to ischemic event without symptoms or ECG changes
   - cont ASA
   - cont b-blocker
   7) Cirrhosis: thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis.  has AMS
   today of unclear cause per ER, but per wife, patient has had normal
   mental status and currently is completely clear.
   - ABG as above
   - lactulose for BMs; cont rifaximin
   - treat infection as above
   - consider diagnostic para for SBP
   8) Coagulopathy: Pt coagulopathic with INR 1.6 and bleeding from line
   sites.  Likely from liver failure.  Will give 2mg PO vit K and follow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has multiple medical conditions. Here is a summary of the information:

1. The patient has a fever, which may be caused by pneumonia (PNA), bacteremia from being on hemodialysis (HD), or an abdominal source. Blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible infection.

2. The patient is experiencing hypoxia and is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. There is no clear evidence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray, but it could be infectious, related to volume overload from HD, or due to a pulmonary embolism.

3. The patient became hypotensive overnight, with pressures in the 80s/30s. This was initially responsive to fluids but became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses. The hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, or cardiogenic shock.

4. The patient had peripheral vascular disease and underwent angioplasty and stenting on [**5-13**]. They were discharged and are being monitored for pulses and wound care.

5. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires hemodialysis today, as well as treatment for hyperkalemia without ECG changes.

6. The patient had coronary artery disease (CAD) and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). They are currently free of chest pain and do not have ECG changes.
