   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old male with extensive CAD, CHF, CKD, and a.fib
   presents with new onset bradycardia and hyperglycemia.
   .
   # Bradycardia: Complete infranodal heart block. Temp pacer placed after
   INR reversal with FFP
   - Hold beta blocker although would likely not affect escape rhythm.
   - PPM placement tomorrow after cefazolin 2gm on call, hep drip stopped
   in AM and NPO after MN.
   -Hold coumadin and allow INR to drift down for pacer placement,
   meanwhile on Hep drip
   # Elevated troponins:
   - Pt's anginal equivalent is SOB, and trop trending up but could be
   from CHF, renal failure, wire placement. On medical management
   including hep drip.
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: ? secondary to ischemia. No signs of infection on U/A
   or CXR and no localizing signs. DM previously well controlled on
   Glipizide only
   -Blood cx
   -Off insulin drip to ISS
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Peak at 2.5, returned to baseline 1.9
   with reperfusion/pacing. Likely due to relative dehydration from
   osmotic diuresis [**2-18**] hyperglycemia and poor forward flow secondary to
   bradycardia.
   - Monitor Cr with diuresis.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: resolved with IVF and resolution of hyperglycemia.
   .
   # HTN: Stable now but holding his home regimen (ace and bb)
   .
   # CHF: Overnight required lasix for increased O2 req and crackles and
   fluff on CXR. Responded well to 20mg IV lasix.
   - Will repeat given improved renal function.
   - Holding ACEi
   .
   # PVD: Stable.
   -Con't Cilostazol
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't Statin
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently well rate controlled [**2-18**] heart block.
   -Hold coumadin for pacer, on hep drip.

   # Iron Def. Anemia: Stable and at baseline.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with extensive cardiovascular disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presents with new-onset bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's current medications include beta-blockers, statins, ACE inhibitors, and anticoagulants. He is also on a diabetic diet and receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is concerning as it can lead to decreased cardiac output and potentially result in hypotension, organ hypoperfusion, and ischemia.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes. This can increase the risk of infections, poor wound healing, and complications related to surgery or procedures.
3. Elevated Troponin Levels: The elevated troponin levels suggest possible myocardial injury or ischemia. This could be due to cardiac events, procedures, or other underlying conditions. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function appears to be deteriorating further, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and accumulation of waste products in the body.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with extensive cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. He presents with new-onset bradycardia and hyperglycemia. The patient has been diagnosed with a complete infranodal heart block, for which a temporary pacer has been placed. A permanent pacemaker placement is planned for today. The patient's elevated troponin levels are stable, and further testing is pending. The patient's anginal equivalent is shortness of breath, and the troponin levels could be due to congestive heart failure, renal failure, or wire placement. The patient is on medical management including a heparin drip.

The patient's hyperglycemia is better controlled, and it is likely reactive to ischemia. There are no signs of infection on urinalysis or chest X-ray, and there are no localizing signs. The patient previously had well-controlled diabetes mellitus on Glipizide only. Blood glucose and urine cultures are negative. The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is likely due to relative dehydration from osmotic diuresis and hyperglycemia, as well as poor forward flow secondary to bradycardia. Monitoring of creatinine with diuresis is recommended.

The patient's hypertension is stable, with a blood pressure reading of 150/68. The patient is currently holding his home regimen of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of extensive coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presented with new onset bradycardia and hyperglycemia. The patient underwent permanent pacemaker placement on [**11-20**] for symptomatic bradycardia. He has been experiencing ventricular ectopy overnight, which could be due to pacer versus native ventricular pacing.

The patient also has a history of dementia and mental status changes, exacerbated by blindness and ICU delirium. An MRI from [**9-11**] showed microvascular ischemia. The patient is on medical management including haloperidol (Haldol) for mental status changes.

Elevated troponins are noted, which could be secondary to ischemia, CHF, renal failure, or wire placement. The patient is currently on medical management for anginal equivalent symptoms.

Hyperglycemia is suspected to be secondary to ischemia. No signs of infection are present on urine analysis (U/A) or chest X-ray (CXR). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was previously well controlled on glipizide.

Acute on chronic renal failure is observed, likely due to relative dehydration from osmotic diuresis and poor forward flow secondary to bradycardia. Monitoring of creatinine levels with diures"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with extensive coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with new-onset bradycardia and hyperglycemia. The patient has undergone permanent pacemaker placement and is scheduled for cefazolin prior to the procedure. His medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, furosemide, spironolactone, lisinopril, simvastatin, and glipizide.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may require further management and monitoring. The permanent pacemaker placement is a suitable intervention to address this issue.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels may indicate uncontrolled diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia. It is important to monitor and manage his blood sugar levels closely.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's peak creatinine level indicates an acute deterioration in renal function. This could be due to relative dehydration, hyperglycemia, and poor forward flow secondary to bradycardia. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels have resolved with intravenous fluids and the resolution of hyperglycemia. It is important to continue monitoring his electrolyte balance.
