   59 F with CAD s/p LAD BMS x 2 on [**2105-3-16**], CHF (EF 20%), [**Date Range 6314**] htn and
   asthma recently discharged three days ago now presents with syncope and
   hypotension.
   .
   # Syncope and hypotension.  Hypotension most likely from overdiuresis
   and too much antihypertensive medications.  She reports losing weight,
   feeling thirsty and lightheaded for the past three days.  This was
   probably exacerbated by mild diarrhea.  Also, during her last
   hospitalization, some of her BP meds were held due to parameters but
   she had been taking all of them at home.  Now also hyponatremic and ARF
   consistent with volume depletion.  Ddx of hypotension includes
   cardiogenic shock from clotting her recent LAD stents but she is not
   having ACS and she is not cool; also has been taking asa + plavix.
   Less likely sepsis since she is not febrile and warm but she did have a
   +Ucx that was not treated and she has leukocytosis.  Not likely
   adrenally insufficient but she has been on stable prednisone.  Ddx of
   syncope includes arrhythmia, seizure, stroke and hypoglycemia but none
   of these are likely.
   -- cautious fluid boluses, CVP improved now [**12-21**] since fluid
   resuscitation overnight
   -- wean neo as tolerated for goal SBP>80
   -- treat UTI from last admission; monitor for sepsis, check SvO2
   -- hold diuretics
   -- hold antihypertensives
   .
   # CAD.  Recent LAD BMSx2.  Compliant with asa + plavix.  No sign of
   acute stent thrombosis.  EKG shows more significant lateral STD
   consistent with strain in setting of hypotension.  Cardiac markers are
   not significantly elevated.
   -- enzymes trended down

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), hypertension, asthma, and recent discharge three days ago. She presents with syncope and hypotension, likely due to overdiuresis and excessive antihypertensive medications. The patient also reports weight loss, thirst, and lightheadedness for the past three days, which may be exacerbated by mild diarrhea. 

The differential diagnosis for hypotension includes cardiogenic shock from clotting her recent left anterior descending (LAD) stents, but this is less likely as she is not experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and is not feeling cool. Sepsis is also less likely since she is not febrile and warm, but she had a positive urine culture (enterococcus) that was not treated, and there is leukocytosis present. Adrenal insufficiency is not likely as she has been on stable prednisone.

The differential diagnosis for syncope includes arrhythmia, seizure, stroke, and hypoglycemia, but none of these are likely. 

The patient's current plan includes cautious fluid boluses, weaning from mechanical ventilation as tolerated for a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) >80, treating urinary tract infection (UTI) from the last admission, monitoring for sepsis, checking mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), holding diure"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 F with CAD s/p LAD BMS x 2 on [**2105-3-16**], CHF (EF 20%), [**Date Range 6314**] htn and
   asthma recently discharged three days ago now presents with syncope and
   hypotension.
   .
   # Syncope and hypotension.  Hypotension most likely from overdiuresis
   and too much antihypertensive medications.  She reports losing weight,
   feeling thirsty and lightheaded for the past three days.  This was
   probably exacerbated by mild diarrhea.  Also, during her last
   hospitalization, some of her BP meds were held due to parameters but
   she had been taking all of them at home.  Now also hyponatremic and ARF
   consistent with volume depletion.  Ddx of hypotension includes
   cardiogenic shock from clotting her recent LAD stents but she is not
   having ACS and she is not cool; also has been taking asa + plavix.
   Less likely sepsis since she is not febrile and warm but she did have a
   +Ucx that was not treated and she has leukocytosis.  Not likely
   adrenally insufficient but she has been on stable prednisone.  Ddx of
   syncope includes arrhythmia, seizure, stroke and hypoglycemia but none
   of these are likely.
   -- cautious fluid boluses, CVP improved now [**12-21**] since fluid
   resuscitation overnight
   -- wean neo as tolerated for goal SBP>80
   -- treat UTI from last admission; monitor for sepsis, check SvO2
   -- hold diuretics
   -- hold antihypertensives
   .
   # CAD.  Recent LAD BMSx2.  Compliant with asa + plavix.  No sign of
   acute stent thrombosis.  EKG shows more significant lateral STD
   consistent with strain in setting of hypotension.  Cardiac markers are
   not significantly elevated.
   -- enzymes trended down
   -- serial EKGs
   -- continue asa, plavix, statin, hold bbocker, ACE
   .
   # CHF: EF 20% with severe LV dilation and severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 6314**] htn.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), recent left anterior descending artery (LAD) bare metal stent placement, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, and asthma. She was recently discharged three days ago and presented with syncope and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64-81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg, and she has received a total of 536 mL of intravenous fluids since midnight.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, glucose level of 236 mg/dL, sodium level of 23 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, chloride level of 95 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.5 mg/dL, phosphate level of 3.6 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.12, and leukocytosis with a count of 5100 cells/mm³.

The patient's physical examination reveals a right facial hematoma with ecchymoses, jugular venous distention of about 8 cm on the left, right internal jugular vein in the neck, regular heart rhythm with a II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex, clear lungs, soft abdomen with mild distension, and no peripheral edema. The patient's extremities are warm and well-perfused.

The patient's assessment includes syncope and hypotension, likely due to overdiuresis and excessive antihypertensive medications. She also has hyponatremia and acute renal failure (ARF) consistent with volume depletion. The differential diagnosis for hypotension includes cardiogenic shock from clotting the recent LAD stents, but this is not supported by the patient's presentation. Other possibilities include sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and arrhythmia.

The patient's plan includes cautious fluid boluses to improve CVP, weaning off the ventilator as tolerated with a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) of more than 80 mmHg, treating a urinary tract infection (UTI) from the previous admission while monitoring for sepsis and checking mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2). Diuretics and antihypertensives are to be held.

The patient's other medical conditions include coronary artery disease with recent LAD bare metal stent placement, congestive heart failure (CHF) with severe left ventricular dilation and moderate mitral regurgitation, hypertension, rib/clavicle fracture sustained from a fall yesterday, depression/anxiety, rhythm disturbance (sinus rhythm), hypothyroidism, asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and a code status of full code.

Overall, the patient is hypovolemic and will undergo cautious fluid resuscitation. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and further deterioration in blood pressure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, asthma, and recent discharge three days ago. She presented with syncope and hypotension, which was most likely due to overdiuresis and excessive antihypertensive medications. She also reported weight loss, thirst, and lightheadedness for the past three days, possibly exacerbated by mild diarrhea. The patient had hyponatremia and acute renal failure consistent with volume depletion. Differential diagnosis for hypotension includes cardiogenic shock from clotting recent LAD stents, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency, but these are less likely. Differential diagnosis for syncope includes arrhythmia, seizure, stroke, and hypoglycemia, but none of those are likely.

Plan:
1. Generous fluid boluses to treat hypovolemia.
2. Wean dopamine and neo as tolerated.
3. Treat UTI from last admission and watch for sepsis.
4. Hold diuretics and antihypertensives.

Assessment and Plan:
1. CAD with recent LAD BMSx2. Compliant with ASA + Plavix. No sign of acute stent thrombosis. EKG shows lateral STD consistent with strain in setting of hypotension. Cardiac markers are not significantly elevated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, asthma, rib/clavicle fracture, depression/anxiety, hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and asthma. She presented with syncope and hypotension, which were likely multifactorial due to increased diuresis, anti-hypertensive medications, and urinary tract infection. Her symptoms improved after treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, she is at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or worsening heart failure.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's asthma puts her at risk for respiratory complications like exacerbation of asthma symptoms or respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The presence of enterococcus infection indicates a risk of further infections, which can lead to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (ARF) should be closely monitored for progression to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, asthma, and diabetes mellitus. She presented to the ICU with syncope and hypotension, which are likely multifactorial due to increased diuresis, anti-hypertensive medications, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's symptoms have improved currently.

Assessment and Plan:
1. CHF: The patient has severe left ventricular dilation and severe mitral regurgitation. She is euvolemic, and her blood pressure is currently being supported with cautious fluid boluses for a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 80. Beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, diuretics, and spironolactone are held due to hypotension. Digoxin is continued, and torsemide is restarted at 40 mg PO once, while captopril is started instead of enalapril.
2. UTI/Vaginal burning: The patient tested positive for enterococcus from this admission, likely the same bacteria as from the previous culture. Vancomycin is continued for a 7-day course, and phenazopyridine is given for ureteral spasm. The patient can use vagifem twice weekly per home regimen.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had recent placement of bare-metal stents"

   -Echo:The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
   indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the entire septum and
   inferior wall, hypokinesis of the anterior wall and anterolateral wall,
   and hypokinesis of the distal inferolateral wall. The basal
   inferolateral wall contracts best. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
   velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do
   not fully coapt. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-3-17**], the
   severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced. The other described

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, asthma, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She presented to the ICU with syncope and hypotension, which were likely multifactorial in nature. The patient's symptoms have improved and she has tolerated the addition of low-dose captopril and torsemide 40mg once daily. She is currently euvolemic.

Medical Complications:
1. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. Her EF has slightly improved to 15-20% but she still has severe left ventricular dilation and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR). She is currently on diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and digoxin. Further adjustments to her medication regimen may be necessary.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture for enterococcus, likely the same bacteria from her previous culture. She is currently receiving vancomycin for a 7-day course and phenazopyridine for ureteral spasm. Antibiotic approval is needed in the next 24 hours.
3. Rib/Clavicle Fracture: The patient sustained fractures from a fall, which are currently well-controlled with pain medication. A sling has been provided for comfort, and the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, hypertension, and asthma. She presented with syncope and hypotension, which were likely multifactorial due to increased diuresis, anti-hypertensive medications, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). Her symptoms have improved, and she has tolerated the addition of low-dose captopril and torsemide 40mg once daily.

The patient's current condition includes severe left ventricular dilation and severe mitral regurgitation (MR), with an EF of 15-20%. She is euvolemic and currently off pressors. Her repeat echo shows slightly improved MR.

The plan includes continuing UTI treatment with vancomycin, holding beta blockers and spironolactone due to hypotension, continuing digoxin, torsemide 20mg PO BID, short-acting captopril instead of enalapril, and adding back beta blockers as tolerated. Consideration is being given to an electrophysiology consult for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD), but the patient has reportedly refused in the past.

Other assessments and plans include treatment for a vaginal infection caused by enterococcus, management of coronary artery disease"

   hypotension.
   Syncope and hypotension.
   Likely multifactorial, related to increased diuresis, anti-hypertensive
   medications, and UTI. Her symptoms are improved currently and has
   tolerated addition of low dose Captopril and torsemide 40mg once
   daily.  Off pressors >24 hours. Currenlty euvolemic. EF yesterday
   15-20%
   - continue UTI treatment with vancomycin as below

   Yesterday
s echocardiogram shows significantly reduced mitral and
   tricuspid regurgitation.  The ejection fraction is similar to
   previously.  We will restart torsemide but I think we should give 20 mg
   only once a day since she appears to be very sensitive to it (as
   opposed to furosemide, which she seems to be relatively resistant to,
   perhaps due to poor absorption).  Transfer to floor today, gradual
   restart hf meds, and when she goes home, she will require very explicit
   parameters for hf medication dosing and withholding (including weight
   parameters for torsemide dosing).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, asthma, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She presented with syncope and hypotension, likely due to increased diuresis, anti-hypertensive medications, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin for UTI, captopril, torsemide, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and digoxin. The medical team plans to continue the current medication regimen, including holding beta blockers and spironolactone due to hypotension, while adding back metoprolol today as tolerated. 

The patient has several ongoing assessments and plans, including treatment for CHF with severe left ventricular (LV) dilation and severe mitral regurgitation (MR). The MR has slightly improved on repeat echocardiogram. 

The patient also has a history of rib/clavicle fractures, depression/anxiety, asthma, renal hypodensity, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of CHF symptoms, further deterioration of renal function, progression of UTI, exacerbation of asthma, and potential side effects from medications such as hypotension or electrolyte imbalances. 

It is important to closely monitor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a medical history of UTI, DM type II, acute and chronic pain, CHF, CAD, anxiety, cardiomyopathy, and asthma. She was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient experienced an episode of hypotension and bradycardia, which resolved after being placed in Trendelenburg position and receiving fluid bolus. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 94/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium, torsemide, captopril, and metoprolol. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has a history of heart failure, coronary artery disease, anxiety, cardiomyopathy, asthma, and diabetes mellitus type II. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of heart failure, coronary artery disease, and recent episode of bradycardia puts her at risk for cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: The presence of urinary tract infection and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis and septic shock.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, asthma, and depression. She presented to the ICU with syncope and hypotension. The patient has undergone multiple medical interventions and has several ongoing medical conditions, including complete heart block, acute respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, renal failure, rib/clavicle fracture, depression/anxiety, asthma, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete Heart Block: The patient experienced complete heart block, which can lead to bradycardia (slow heart rate) and hypotension (low blood pressure). Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with crackles at the bases of the lungs on auscultation. This may indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs, potentially due to worsening congestive heart failure or an infection. Close monitoring and possible interventions such as diuretics or antibiotics may be necessary.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive culture for enterococcus, indicating a UTI. Since she is sensitive to macrobid, it will be switched to a complete 7-day course of a different antibiotic. Additionally, phenazopyridine has been prescribed for ureteral spasm.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has renal hypodensity on CT scan,"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These complications include:

1. Complete heart block: The patient has experienced an episode of complete heart block, which is a serious condition where the electrical signals that control the heart rhythm are blocked. This can lead to bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), and even syncope (fainting). The patient's previous history of asthma and recent coronary artery disease may contribute to this complication.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is currently on nasal cannula with oxygen delivery. The ABG results show an unspecified parameter, indicating the need for further evaluation of the patient's respiratory status. This could suggest the possibility of acute respiratory failure or inadequate oxygenation.

3. Renal hypodensity: The CT scan revealed renal hypodensity, indicating a possible impairment in kidney function. This could be due to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Proper renal function assessment and monitoring are necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Rib/clavicle fracture: The patient has sustained fractures in the rib and clavicle due to a fall. Although currently well-controlled with pain medication, close monitoring and appropriate management are required to prevent any complications related to the fractures.

5. UTI/Vaginal burning: The patient has a confirmed Enterococcus infection from this admission. Proper antibiotic therapy should be continued"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, asthma, and congestive heart failure (EF 20%). She presented with syncope and hypotension, which were likely due to complete heart block. She has had previous episodes of heart block, and her ECG showed persistent lateral ST depressions indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy/strain. 

The patient underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization, which revealed 70-80% stenosis of the right coronary artery (RCA), which was subsequently recanalized. She is currently on heparin, aspirin, and clopidogrel. 

Her congestive heart failure (CHF) has been managed by diuresis, resulting in euvolemia. However, there are concerns regarding her low ejection fraction (EF 15-20%) and severe left ventricular dilation with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). 

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by enterococcus, for which she will be given a 7-day course of macrobid. She is allergic to penicillins and aspirin, which has caused wheezing in the past. 

She has sustained fractures of the rib and clavicle, but pain is well controlled with Tylenol and tramadol. 

Other medical conditions include renal hypodensity, hypothyroidism, depression/anxiety, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and asthma. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/54 mmHg to 118/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete heart block: The patient's recurrent episodes of heart block can potentially lead to bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's low ejection fraction and severe left ventricular dilation with severe MR put her at risk for worsening CHF. Close monitoring of fluid balance and medication adjustment are important to prevent exacerbations.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's UTI caused by enterococcus needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Failure to treat the infection may result in worsening symptoms and potential spread of the infection.
4. Fractures: The patient's rib and clavicle fractures may require further evaluation and management by a trauma specialist. Proper pain control and preventive measures should be taken to prevent complications associated with immobilization.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's stable hypothyroidism requires ongoing management with levothyroxine. Inadequate treatment can lead to metabolic disturbances and other complications.
6. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes should be closely monitored, especially considering her recent admission. Poor glycemic control can lead to various complications, including cardiovascular events and infections."

The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, asthma, depression/anxiety, rib/clavicle fracture, hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and renal hypodensity. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to syncope and hypotension. She has undergone several procedures and treatments, including the placement of a [**Hospital1 **]-V/ICD, administration of vancomycin, heparin sodium, and restart of captopril and torsemide. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she continues to experience some complications related to her underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete Heart Block: The patient has developed complete heart block with junctional escape. This condition can lead to a decrease in cardiac output and potentially result in syncope or even sudden cardiac arrest if not properly managed.

2. CHF: The patient has severe left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 15-20% and severe mitral regurgitation.
