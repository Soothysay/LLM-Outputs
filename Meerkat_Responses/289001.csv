   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presentinng with
   obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension in the context of
   fever and some indications of increased tone.  Now intubated for
   hypoxic respiratory failure and being broadly treated for serotonin
   syndrome and pneumonia.
   1)Obtundation: Ultimate etiology is not clear at this time.  Major
   concerns include serotonin syndrome due to trazodone/SSRI (given
   diaphoresis, HTN, and clonus) vs drug intoxication (less likely given
   relatively unimpressive tox screen) vs infection.  Seizure could also
   cause post-ictal mental status changes.  Meningitis/encephalitis
   extremely unlikely given no pleiocytosis but cannot exclude HSV w/o PCR
   so will treat empirically for the moment.  Finally, it is possible
   respiratory failure could have caused obtundation though seems unlikely
   in an otherwise healthy young man.  Consumption of non ethanol alcohols
   was also considered but no osmolal gap suggesting this.
   -cyproheptidine 4 mg Q6hrs for serotonin syndrome
   -acyclovir empirically for consern HSV meningitis
   -vanc/zosyn/levo for possible PNA given bilateral infiltrates and fever
   in the ED in this critically ill gentlman
   -F/U tox reccs
   2)Shock: The patient had hypotension today after receiving his propofol
   sedation.  Possible etiologies of his shock would include vasodilation
   vs cardiogenic vs hypovolemic.  Given the patient's appearance and
   bilateral infiltrates/enlarged hila it seems unlikely he is hypovolemic
   though he could have been initially.  Cardiogenic shock also seems
   unlikely given he was quickly weaned off pressors after arrival to the
   floor and few etiologies of cardiogenic shock would resolve that
   quickly without specific management.  Shock due to vasodilatory
   phenomena seem most likely given exclusion of other types.  Propofol
   can cause profound hypotension in certain circumstances and the fact
   that hypotension didn't occur until sedation would support this.
   Autonomic instability due to serotonin syndrome could also potentially
   contribute to rapid transition from hypertension to hypotension.
   Finally, given fever/leukocytosis there is concern for septic shock.
   -blood cx, broad spectrum abx
   -cyprohepatidine
   -Echo in AM
   3) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient had an unwitnessed event
   leading to loss of consciousness.  Most processed that cause this
   (intoxication, seizure, etc..) can lead to periods of decreased airway
   protection therefore high level of concern for aspiration.  Appearance
   of CXR could be consistent with aspiration pneumonitis, vs PNA, vs
   edema.  Will cover with antibiotics given fever and hold off on
   diuresis given hypotension earlier.  Sputum cultures suggest aspiration
   (oropharyngeal flora in endotracheal specimen).  Patient is currently
   oxygenating and ventilating well on reasonable ventilator settings
   particularly given previous need for 100% O2.
   -Wean FiO2 and then PEEP
   -Vanco/Pipercillin-Tazobactam for health care associated pneumonia
   (patient has spent around 48 hours in health care settings/borderline
   call but covering due to high acuity).  Also using levofloxacin to
   cover atypicals.
   -sputum cultures
   -urine legionella
   -Rapid flu antigen test and viral culture
   4) Renal failure: Patient nearly anuric since arrival to floor.
   Elevated CK and blood/rbc dissociation on UA suggestive or
   rhabdomyolysis particularly given this is an otherwise healthy young
   man with presumably a normal Cr before.  Still, nephrology thinks CK
   not high enough for this degree of failure and time course not exactly
   appropriate.  Granular casts of unclear significance.
   -Renal consult in AM
   -Urine lytes, protein
   -Attempt 100 mg IV furosemide * 1 for trial of diuresis on renal recc
   -Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   5)Fever: Concern for infection of course is primarily and will be
   worked up per above.  Also possibly from serotonin syndrome,
   vasculitis, etc...
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
   -Consider CT to look for occult abcess if repeated fevers once stable
   6) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Vesicles could suggest herpes but
   are not typical and not particularly painful it seems.
   -unroof vesicle and send for viral cutlure.
   7) Neuro: Unclear on significance of bilateral clonus w/o other
   neurologic abnormalities.  Ct head slightly abnormal and patient's MS
   is poor.
   -Neuro consult in the AM
   8) Prophylaxis: Heparin SC, famotidine
   9) FEN: NPO for now, OG and tube feeds tomorrow
   10) Code Status: Presumed full
   11) Dispo: ICU for moment

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation, respiratory failure, and hypotension.
- The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is being treated for serotonin syndrome and pneumonia.
- The patient's obtundation could be due to several causes such as serotonin syndrome, drug intoxication, infection, or post-ictal mental status changes.
- The patient also experienced shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, renal failure, fever, and skin rashes.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, poisoning/overdose, and presumed full code status.
- The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, insertion of multi-lumen and arterial lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Further investigations, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, are needed to identify and treat the infection promptly.
2. Serotonin syndrome: The patient's presentation with diaphoresis, hypertension, and clonus raises concern for serotonin syndrome. Continued monitoring and management with appropriate medications are necessary.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray may indicate the"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presentinng with
   obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension in the context of
   fever and some indications of increased tone.  Now intubated for
   hypoxic respiratory failure and being broadly treated for serotonin
   syndrome and pneumonia.
   1)Obtundation: Ultimate etiology is not clear at this time.  Major
   concerns include serotonin syndrome, intoxication, or post-ictal
   state.  Given extremely few cells in CSF will d/c empiric acyclovir
   therapy for HSV due to risk this poses to renal function.   Will
   continue to treat empirically for serotonin syndrome and monitor.
   -cyproheptidine 4 mg Q6hrs for serotonin syndrome
   - STOP acyclovir empirically for consern HSV meningitis
   -F/U toxicology reccs
   -Attempt to wean sedation and reassess mental status
   2)Shock:  The patient was hypotensive in the ED but only after
   receiving propofol sedation.  This completely resolved and he is in
   fact hypertensive off pressor support at this time.  Presumably his
   initial hypotension was iatrogenic.   In the short term we would prefer
   mild hypertension to hypotension in this gentleman but given MAP
s >100
   we will treat.
   -labetalol given concern for past cocaine abuse and unapposed B
   blockade
   -Echocardiogram to evaluate EF
   3) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis, vs PNA, vs edema.  We will cover for aspiration
   pneumonia and CA-MRSA with antibiotics though there are definitely

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse. He presented with obtundation, respiratory failure, and hypotension, along with fever and increased tone. The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is being treated for suspected serotonin syndrome and pneumonia. 

Medical Complications:
1. Obtundation: The cause of the patient's obtundation is unclear, with possible causes including serotonin syndrome, intoxication, or a post-ictal state. Empiric acyclovir therapy for HSV has been stopped due to concerns about renal function. The patient will continue to be monitored for signs of serotonin syndrome and other potential causes.

2. Shock: The patient was initially hypotensive in the emergency department but responded to fluid resuscitation and is now hypertensive. The initial hypotension was likely iatrogenic. Mild hypertension is preferred, and the patient is being treated with labetalol due to a history of cocaine abuse and unopposed beta blockade. An echocardiogram will be done to evaluate the patient's ejection fraction.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The likely etiologies include aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, or edema. The patient is currently oxygenating and ventilating well on reasonable ventilator settings. Antibiotics have been started to cover for aspiration pneumonia and CA-MRSA, and the FiO2 and PEEP will be weaned as"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presentinng with
   obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension in the context of
   fever and some indications of increased tone.  Now intubated for
   hypoxic respiratory failure and being broadly treated for serotonin
   syndrome and pneumonia.
   1)Obtundation: Ultimate etiology is not clear at this time.  Major
   concerns include serotonin syndrome, intoxication, or post-ictal
   state.  Given extremely few cells in CSF will d/c empiric acyclovir
   therapy for HSV due to risk this poses to renal function.   Will
   continue to treat empirically for serotonin syndrome and monitor.
   -cyproheptidine 4 mg Q6hrs for serotonin syndrome
   - STOP acyclovir empirically for consern HSV meningitis
   -F/U toxicology reccs
   -Attempt to wean sedation and reassess mental status
   2)Shock:  The patient was hypotensive in the ED but only after
   receiving propofol sedation.  This completely resolved and he is in
   fact hypertensive off pressor support at this time.  Presumably his
   initial hypotension was iatrogenic.   In the short term we would prefer
   mild hypertension to hypotension in this gentleman but given MAP
s >100
   we will treat.
   -labetalol given concern for past cocaine abuse and unapposed B
   blockade
   -Echocardiogram to evaluate EF
   3) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis, vs PNA, vs edema.  We will cover for aspiration
   pneumonia and CA-MRSA with antibiotics though there are definitely
   other potential etiologies for fever in this patient.    Patient is
   currently oxygenating and ventilating well on reasonable ventilator
   settings particularly given previous need for 100% O2.
   -Wean FiO2 and then PEEP as tolerated
   -Vanco/Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia, we will d/c
   levofloxacin as legionella antigen negative and this patient would not
   be typical epidemiology of this pathogen; we will also d/c pipercillin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with obtundation, respiratory failure, and hypotension.
- The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is being treated for serotonin syndrome and pneumonia.
- The patient's mental status is currently unclear, and there are concerns about the etiology of his obtundation.
- The patient experienced initial hypotension in the ED but has since become hypertensive.
- The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema.
- The patient also has acute renal failure, likely a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and rhabdomyolysis.
- Other potential complications include fever, skin rash, and neurologic abnormalities.
- The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretic therapy, and supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Serotonin syndrome: The patient is being treated for serotonin syndrome, which can cause altered mental status, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of respiratory failure and is being treated for pneumonia. Complications may include worsening hypoxia, sepsis, or the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed.

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presentinng with
   obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension in the context of
   fever and some indications of increased tone.  Now intubated for
   hypoxic respiratory failure and with persistently altered MS.
   1)Obtundation: Ultimate etiology is not clear at this time.  Major
   concerns include serotonin syndrome, intoxication, or post-ictal
   state.  Given extremely few cells in CSF minimal concern for
   meningitis/encephalitis.  Mental status mildly improved since last
   night but still not consistently purposeful.  Concern for anoxic brain
   injury.
   -completed cyproheptidine treatment
   -off sedation
   -if mental status not consistently improving CT head to rule out edema
   or acute process, proceed to neuro consult and MRI/EEG
   2)Shock:  The patient was hypotensive in the ED but only after
   receiving propofol sedation.  This completely resolved and he is in
   fact hypertensive off pressor support at this time.  Presume
   hypotension was iatrogenic.  .
   -labetalol given concern for past cocaine abuse and unapposed B
   blockade
   -Echocardiogram with normal EF
   3) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis, vs PNA, vs edema.  We will cover for aspiration
   pneumonia and CA-MRSA with antibiotics though there are definitely
   other potential etiologies for fever in this patient.    Patient is
   currently oxygenating and ventilating well on reasonable ventilator
   settings particularly given previous need for 100% O2.   Now doing well
   on pressure support.  Primary reason for continued ventilation is
   mental status.
   -Vanco/Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia
   -sputum cultures
   -Rapid flu antigen test negative
    4) Renal failure: Patient with good urine output but Cr continues to
   rise.  Presumed etiology is ATN and rhabdomyoloysis.
   -Goal UOP of 150-200cc/hr
   -D5W given free water deficit and careful to avoid hypovolemia in
   setting of self-diuresis
    5)Fever: Concern for infection of course is primarily and will be
   worked up per above.  Also possibly from serotonin syndrome,
   vasculitis, etc...
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
   6) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Vesicles could suggest herpes but
   are not typical and not particularly painful it seems.
   -f/u culture from vesicle
   7) Neuro: Unclear on significance of bilateral clonus w/o other
   neurologic abnormalities.  Ct head slightly abnormal and patient's MS
   is poor.  Neuro consult in AM and imaging per above if not improving
   dramatically over course of day.
   8) Prophylaxis: Heparin SC, famotidine

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, presenting with obtundation, respiratory failure, and hypotension. He is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and has persistently altered mental status. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including serotonin syndrome, intoxication, or a post-ictal state. Other concerns include anoxic brain injury, shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, renal failure, fever, skin rashes, and neurologic abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Obtundation: The ultimate etiology is not clear at this time, with concerns including serotonin syndrome, intoxication, or a post-ictal state. Mental status mildly improved since last night but still not consistently purposeful. Concern for anoxic brain injury.
2. Shock: The patient was hypotensive in the ED but only after receiving propofol sedation. This completely resolved, and he is hypertensive off pressor support at this time. Presume hypotension was iatrogenic.

Given the minimal cells in the CSF, there is minimal concern for meningitis/encephalitis. The patient's mental status has improved slightly since the previous night but is still not consistently purposeful. There is concern for anoxic brain injury.
2. Shock: The patient was initially hypotensive in the emergency department but only after receiving propofol sedation. This resolved and he is now hypertensive off pressor support. It is presumed that the hypotension was iatrogenic. Labetalol was given due to concern for past cocaine abuse and unopposed beta blockade.
3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The most likely etiologies include aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, or edema. The patient is currently oxygenating and ventilating well on reasonable ventilator settings, particularly given the previous need for 100% O2. He is doing well on pressure support. The primary reason for continued ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presentinng with
   obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension in the context of
   fever and some indications of increased tone.  Now intubated for
   hypoxic respiratory failure and with persistently altered MS.
   1)Obtundation: Patient continues to be altered and without clearly
   purposeful movements.  Intermittent jerks consistent with myoclonus.
   Intoxication or serotonin syndrome would most likely resolve by now.
   Major concern is for long period down and hypoxic brain injury.
   -CT repeated this AM to look for edema post anoxic injury.  Not a great
   deal of additional edema on our prelim eval.
   -off sedation as much as possible to assess mental status, propofol
   boluses PRN
   -Neuro consult
   2)Shock:  The patient was hypotensive in the ED but only after
   receiving propofol sedation.  This completely resolved and he is in
   fact hypertensive off pressor support at this time.  Presume
   hypotension was iatrogenic.  Now consistently hypertensive.
   -labetalol given concern for past cocaine abuse and unapposed B
   blockade
   -Echocardiogram with normal EF
    3) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis, vs PNA, vs edema.  We will cover for aspiration
   pneumonia and CA-MRSA with antibiotics though there are definitely
   other potential etiologies for fever in this patient.    Patient is
   currently oxygenating and ventilating well on reasonable ventilator
   settings particularly given previous need for 100% O2.   Now doing well
   on pressure support.  Primary reason for continued ventilation is
   mental status.
   -Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia, stop vancomycin as no
   S. aureus on sputum cultures
    4) Renal failure: Patient with good urine output but Cr continues to
   rise.  Presumed etiology is ATN and rhabdomyoloysis.
   -Goal UOP of 150-200cc/hr
   -Free water boluses to correct hypernatremia, repeat evening lytes
    5)Fever: Concern for infection of course is primarily and will be
   worked up per above.  Also possibly from serotonin syndrome,
   vasculitis, neurogenic fever, etc
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
    6) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Vesicles could suggest herpes but
   are not typical and not particularly painful it seems.
   -f/u culture from vesicle
    7) Neuro: Unclear on significance of bilateral clonus w/o other
   neurologic abnormalities.  Ct head slightly abnormal and patient's MS
   is poor.  Neuro consult in AM and imaging per above if not improving
   dramatically over course of day.
    8) Prophylaxis: Heparin SC, famotidine
    9) FEN: NPO for now, will get tube feeding recommendations/nutrition
   consult
   10)Access: PIV
s, A-line
   -given concern about stability of PIV
s and inability to place PICC due
   to fevers will place CVL this afternoon
    10) Code Status: Presumed full
    11) Dispo: ICU for moment

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who presented with obtundation, respiratory failure, and hypotension. He is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient has persistent altered mental status and intermittent jerks consistent with myoclonus. Major concerns include a long period of unconsciousness and potential hypoxic brain injury.
- The patient was initially hypotensive but now is hypertensive off pressor support. Labetalol was given due to past cocaine abuse and unopposed beta blockade.
- The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may be due to aspiration pneumonia, pneumonia caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), or pulmonary edema. He is currently oxygenating and ventilating well on pressure support.
- The patient's creatinine levels continue to rise, indicating renal failure. The presumed etiology is acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and rhabdomyolysis. Goal urine output is set at 150-200 cc/hr, and free water boluses will be given to correct hypernatremia.
- The patient has a fever, which could be due to infection or other causes such as serotonin syndrome, vasculitis, or neurogenic fever. Cultures will be monitored, and further workup will be done.
- The patient has rashes on his medial knees, which appear consistent"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presentinng with
   obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension in the context of
   fever and some indications of increased tone.  Now intubated for
   hypoxic respiratory failure and with persistently altered MS.
   1)Obtundation: Patient continues to be altered and without clearly
   purposeful movements.  Intermittent jerks consistent with myoclonus.
   Intoxication or serotonin syndrome would most likely resolve by now.
   Major concern is for long period down and hypoxic brain injury.
   -CT repeated this AM to look for edema post anoxic injury.  Not a great
   deal of additional edema on our prelim eval.
   -off sedation as much as possible to assess mental status, propofol
   boluses PRN
   -Neuro consult
    2)Shock:  The patient was hypotensive in the ED but only after
   receiving propofol sedation.  This completely resolved and he is in
   fact hypertensive off pressor support at this time.  Presume
   hypotension was iatrogenic.  Now consistently hypertensive.
   -labetalol given concern for past cocaine abuse and unapposed B blockad
   -Echocardiogram with normal EF
     3) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis, vs PNA, vs edema.  We will cover for aspiration
   pneumonia and CA-MRSA with antibiotics though there are definitely
   other potential etiologies for fever in this patient.    Patient is
   currently oxygenating and ventilating well on reasonable ventilator
   settings particularly given previous need for 100% O2.   Now doing well
   on pressure support.  Primary reason for continued ventilation is
   mental status.
   -Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia, stop vancomycin as no
   S. aureus on sputum cultures
    4) Renal failure: Patient with good urine output but Cr continues to
   rise.  Presumed etiology is ATN and rhabdomyoloysis.
   -Goal UOP of 150-200cc/hr
   -Free water boluses to correct hypernatremia, repeat evening lytes
    5)Fever: Concern for infection of course is primarily and will be
   worked up per above.  Also possibly from serotonin syndrome,
   vasculitis, neurogenic fever, etc
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
    6) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Vesicles could suggest herpes but
   are not typical and not particularly painful it seems.
   -f/u culture from vesicle
    7) Neuro: Unclear on significance of bilateral clonus w/o other
   neurologic abnormalities.  Ct head slightly abnormal and patient's MS
   is poor.  Neuro consult in AM and imaging per above if not improving
   dramatically over course of day.
    8) Prophylaxis: Heparin SC, famotidine
    9) FEN: NPO for now, will get tube feeding recommendations/nutrition
   consult
   10)Access: PIV
s, A-line
   -given concern about stability of PIV
s and inability to place PICC due
   to fevers will place CVL this afternoon

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation, respiratory failure, hypotension, fever, and increased tone. He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and continues to have persistently altered mental status. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/64 to 159/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of obtundation, shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, renal failure, fever, skin rash, neurologic abnormalities, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic brain injury due to prolonged hypoxemia and altered mental status.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis and potential use of nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Nosocomial pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and immunocompromised state.
4. Sepsis or systemic inflammatory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has been through various medical interventions and complications. The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Obtundation: The patient's mental status is altered, and he is encephalopathic. Neurology consults agree that his picture is most consistent with anoxic brain injury. Further evaluation with CT scan and neuroimaging is recommended.

2. Shock: The patient was initially hypotensive but resolved after receiving propofol sedation. It is presumed that the hypotension was iatrogenic. The patient is now hypertensive, and labetalol has been given due to past cocaine abuse and unopposed beta blockade.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient most likely etiologies include aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia (PNA), and edema. Antibiotics have been started to cover for aspiration pneumonia and CA-MRSA.

4. Renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine continues to rise, indicating renal failure. The presumed etiology is acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and rhabdomyolysis. The goal urine output is set at 150-200cc/hr, and free water boluses are given to correct hypernatremia.

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presentinng with
   obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension in the context of
   fever and some indications of increased tone.  Now respiratory issues
   have largely resolved and doing well on pressure support, but no
   clearly purposeful movements and continuing to be encephalopathic.
    1)Obtundation: Seen by neurology who agree his picture is most
   consistent with anoxic brain injury and prognosis is not favorable.
   Some concern for laterality of findings so we are obtaining an MRI head
   today and an EEG to rule out epileptiform activity.
   -CT repeated this AM to look for edema post anoxic injury.  Not a great
   deal of additional edema on our prelim eval.
   -off sedation as much as possible to assess mental status, propofol
   boluses PRN
   -Neuro consult
    2)Shock:  The patient was hypotensive in the ED but only after
   receiving propofol sedation.  This completely resolved and he is in
   fact hypertensive off pressor support at this time.  Presume
   hypotension was iatrogenic.  Now consistently hypertensive.
   -labetalol given concern for past cocaine abuse and unapposed B blockad
   -Echocardiogram with normal EF
     3) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis, vs PNA, vs edema.  We will cover for aspiration
   pneumonia and CA-MRSA with antibiotics though there are definitely
   other potential etiologies for fever in this patient.    Patient is
   currently oxygenating and ventilating well on reasonable ventilator
   settings particularly given previous need for 100% O2.   Now doing well
   on pressure support.  Primary reason for continued ventilation is
   mental status.
   -Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia, stop vancomycin as no
   S. aureus on sputum cultures
    4) Renal failure: Patient with good urine output but Cr continues to
   rise.  Presumed etiology is ATN and rhabdomyoloysis.
   -Goal UOP of 150-200cc/hr
   -Free water boluses to correct hypernatremia, repeat evening lytes
    5)Fever: Concern for infection of course is primarily and will be
   worked up per above.  Also possibly from serotonin syndrome,
   vasculitis, neurogenic fever, etc
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
    6) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Vesicles could suggest herpes but
   are not typical and not particularly painful it seems.
   -f/u culture from vesicle
    7) Neuro: Unclear on significance of bilateral clonus w/o other
   neurologic abnormalities.  Ct head slightly abnormal and patient's MS
   is poor.  Neuro consult in AM and imaging per above if not improving
   dramatically over course of day.
    8) Prophylaxis: Heparin SC, famotidine
    9) FEN: NPO for now, will get tube feeding recommendations/nutrition
   consult
   10)Access: PIV
s, A-line
   -given concern about stability of PIV
s and inability to place PICC due
   to fevers will place CVL this afternoon

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation, respiratory failure, and hypotension. He has shown improvement in respiratory issues but remains encephalopathic. The patient's obtundation is consistent with anoxic brain injury, and the prognosis is not favorable. An MRI head and EEG are being obtained to rule out epileptiform activity. The patient's hypotension was likely iatrogenic due to propofol sedation. He is now hypertensive and receiving labetalol due to concern for past cocaine abuse and unopposed beta blockade. The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may be due to aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, or edema. Antibiotics have been started to cover for aspiration pneumonia and CA-MRSA. The patient's renal function is deteriorating despite good urine output, indicating presumed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and rhabdomyolysis. The patient has a fever, which may be caused by infection or other conditions such as serotonin syndrome, vasculitis, or neurogenic fever. The patient's skin rash is most consistent with friction/pressure-induced injury. Neurological abnormalities are present, including bilateral clonus without other neurologic abnormalities. A neurology consult and imaging are planned. The patient requires prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presentinng with
   obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension in the context of
   fever and some indications of increased tone.  Now respiratory issues
   have largely resolved and doing well on pressure support, but no
   clearly purposeful movements and continuing to be encephalopathic.
    1)Obtundation: Seen by neurology who agree his picture is most
   consistent with anoxic brain injury and prognosis is not favorable.
   Some concern for laterality of findings so we are obtaining an MRI head
   today and an EEG to rule out epileptiform activity.
   -f/u EEG and MRI
   -Presumably the primary injury is anoxic brain injury and expect
   minimal recovery.  After final studies and neuro input will discuss
   with family implications of further decisions.  Patient likely to
   continue to breathe adequately if extubated (though would probably be
   chronic aspiration risk) but will address whether to re-intubate and/or
   proceed with trach
   -Minimize sedation
    2)Shock:  The patient was hypotensive in the ED but only after
   receiving propofol sedation.  This completely resolved and he is in
   fact hypertensive off pressor support at this time.  Presume
   hypotension was iatrogenic.  Now inclined toward hypertension but
   improved with up-titration of labetalol
   -Continue labetalol
     3) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis, vs PNA.  CXR currently resolving and patient is
   needing minimal respiratory support.  Primary reason for continued
   ventilation is mental status.
   -Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia for seven day course
    4) Renal failure: Cr. Continuing to fall though urine output falling
   as well, expect resolution of injury from rhabdo/ATN but will continue
   to monitor.
   -Free water boluses to correct hypernatremia, repeat evening lytes
    5)Fever: Concern for infection of course is primarily and will be
   worked up per above.  Also possibly from serotonin syndrome,
   vasculitis, neurogenic fever, etc
  Given improving lung findings and
   broad abx coverage highest suspicion for central fever now.
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
    6) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Vesicles could suggest herpes but

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension. He was found to have increased signal in the globus pallidus on CT head, indicating potential brain injury. The patient received multiple treatments including intubation, mechanical ventilation, and administration of antibiotics. His condition has improved with resolution of respiratory issues and reduced sedation. However, he remains encephalopathic with no clear purposeful movements. The primary diagnosis is anoxic brain injury, and the prognosis is not favorable. Further investigations such as EEG and MRI are planned to rule out other causes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Obtundation: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen due to the presumed anoxic brain injury. Minimal recovery is expected, and further neurological input is required.
2. Shock: The patient was initially hypotensive but responded well to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure hemodynamic stability.
3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The most likely etiologies include aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia. While the patient's lung findings are improving, continued ventilation may be necessary due to mental status impairment.
4. Renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which may be due to rhabdomyolysis or acute tubular necrosis. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation
   and respiratory failure.
   #) Anoxic brain injury: Seen by neurology who agree his picture is most
   consistent with anoxic brain injury and prognosis is not favorable.
   MRI also showed extensive areas of restricted diffusion consistent with
   this diagnosis.   Fortunately, was able to verbally respond to simple
   questions from family on afternoon of [**2162-3-13**].
   -f/u EEG
   -regular assessment of mental status
   #) Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis vs PNA.  CXR currently resolving and patient is
   s/p extubation on [**2162-3-12**] and generally breathing comfortably.  Had
   [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] respirations earlier today but now has normal breathing
   pattern.
   -Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia for seven day course
   (day 1 = [**3-9**])
   #) Renal failure:  Secondary to rhabdo and ATN.  Creatinine falling.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to monitor
   #) Fever: Concern for infection and culturing when patient spikes
   fevers.  Also may be related to serotonin syndrome, vasculitis,
   neurogenic fever, etc
  Fever curve trending down.
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
   #) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Vesicles could suggest herpes but
   are not typical and not particularly painful it seems.
   -f/u culture from vesicle
   #) Hypernatremia:  Likely secondary to insensible losses but may also
   be related to intracranial injury.  Free water deficit of 4.5 liters on
   [**2162-3-13**].
   - correct sodium with free water boluses, D5W by [**11-8**] mEq/day
   - check p.m. sodium level

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has shown improvement in respiratory issues and is doing well on pressure support ventilation. However, he continues to be encephalopathic with no clearly purposeful movements. 

The patient's MRI head revealed extensive areas of restricted diffusion involving the white matter, corpus callosum, both globus pallidus, and right hippocampus, indicative of acute infarct/ischemia likely due to global hypoxia. 

The patient's blood work showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low platelet count (Plt), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated D-dimer levels. 

The patient's assessment and plan include anoxic brain injury, hypoxemic respiratory failure, renal failure, fever, skin rash, hypernatremia, and other ongoing medical issues. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the anoxic brain injury, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further renal dysfunction, infection due to immunosuppression, and skin breakdown or pressure ulcers. 

The patient's current condition and potential complications will require close monitoring and appropriate management by the healthcare team."

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presentinng with
   obtundations, respiratory failure, and hypotension in the context of
   fever and some indications of increased tone.  Now respiratory issues
   have largely resolved and doing well on pressure support, but no
   clearly purposeful movements and continuing to be encephalopathic.
   1)Obtundation: Seen by neurology who agree his picture is most
   consistent with anoxic brain injury and prognosis is not favorable.
   Some concern for laterality of findings so we are obtaining an MRI head
   today and an EEG to rule out epileptiform activity.
   -f/u EEG and MRI
   -Presumably the primary injury is anoxic brain injury and expect
   minimal recovery.  After final studies and neuro input will discuss
   with family implications of further decisions.  Patient likely to
   continue to breathe adequately if extubated (though would probably be
   chronic aspiration risk) but will address whether to re-intubate and/or
   proceed with trach
   -Minimize sedation
   2)Shock:  The patient was hypotensive in the ED but only after
   receiving propofol sedation.  This completely resolved and he is in
   fact hypertensive off pressor support at this time.  Presume
   hypotension was iatrogenic.  Now inclined toward hypertension but
   improved with up-titration of labetalol
   -Continue labetalol
   3) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis, vs PNA.  CXR currently resolving and patient is
   needing minimal respiratory support.  Primary reason for continued
   ventilation is mental status.
   -Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia for seven day course
   4) Renal failure: Cr. Continuing to fall though urine output falling as
   well, expect resolution of injury from rhabdo/ATN but will continue to
   monitor.
   -Free water boluses to correct hypernatremia, repeat evening lytes
   5)Fever: Concern for infection of course is primarily and will be
   worked up per above.  Also possibly from serotonin syndrome,
   vasculitis, neurogenic fever, etc
  Given improving lung findings and
   broad abx coverage highest suspicion for central fever now.
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
   6) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Vesicles could suggest herpes but
   are not typical and not particularly painful it seems.
   -f/u culture from vesicle
   7) Hypernatremia: Possibly due to free water deficit and saline
   repletion but given persistently high despite free water boluses
   yesterday and known intracranial injury we are concerned for SIADH.
   -Recheck serum and urine osms, urine lytes
   8) Prophylaxis: Heparin SC, famotidine
   9) FEN: Tube feeds
   10)Access: R IJ, A-line, PIV
   11) Code Status: Presumed full
   11) Dispo: ICU for moment

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He is currently extubated but requires pressure support for breathing. The patient's neurological status remains encephalopathic with no purposeful movements. An MRI head shows extensive areas of restricted diffusion involving the white matter, corpus callosum, both globus pallidus, and right hippocampus, indicative of acute infarct/ischemia likely due to global hypoxia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/71 mmHg to 172/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 40%. The patient has been receiving various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, ampicillin-sublactam, and others.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 21.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 11.0 g/dL, blood glucose of 100 mg/dL, sodium of 147 mEq/L, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, and lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L. Imaging studies"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male admitted from the detox unit with an unknown drug overdose, seizures (lumbar puncture negative), likely aspiration pneumonia with severe rhabdomyolysis. He was intubated and briefly on pressors. The patient initially received high FiO2/PEEP likely causing volume overload, but this has since been weaned down with diuresis. The patient remained intubated for mental status reasons - MRI showed diffuse anoxic brain injury. After a family meeting, it was decided to extubate the patient yesterday before committing to a tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient is currently on unasyn for aspiration pneumonia but persists with a fever. The vital signs show a temperature of 102.2°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/84 mmHg to 145/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight is currently 92 kg, with a height of 72 inches.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,758 mL and output of 2,435 mL, resulting in a balance of 323 mL. The respiratory support shows the patient is off invasive ventilation, with a spontaneous tidal volume (Vt) of 878 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old male who was admitted from the detox unit with an unknown drug overdose, seizures (with a negative lumbar puncture), and likely aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with severe rhabdomyolysis. He was intubated and briefly on pressors. The patient initially received high FiO2/PEEP but was weaned down with diuresis. He remained intubated due to mental status issues, and an MRI showed diffuse anoxic brain injury. After a family meeting, it was decided to extubate the patient before considering a tracheostomy. The patient is currently on unasyn for aspiration PNA but remains persistently febrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Fever: The cause of the fever is unclear, with possibilities including aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis or neurogenic causes. Monitoring the fever curve and obtaining cultures is necessary.
3. Renal failure: The patient may have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to rhabdomyolysis. Free water boluses should be given to correct hypernatremia, and renal function should be closely monitored.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient has presumed liver dysfunction due to rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring liver enzymes is important.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has evidence of anoxic brain injury"

   acute infarct/ischemia likely due to global hypoxia.
   2. No evidence of midline shift or herniation.

    The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of
   anterior
   and posterior circulation.
   IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation
   and respiratory failure.
    #) Anoxic brain injury:  Patient has presentation and symptoms most
   consistent with anoxic brain injury.  Neurology in agreement and MRI
   and EEG consistent with that diagnosis.  Had very minimal
   responsiveness while intubated but currently responding intermittently
   appropriately to simple questions.  Still difficult to understand and
   reports unable to move hands or feets.  Ventilating and oxygenating
   well since extubated.
   -follow mental status
   -will likely need placement to long term rehab/care facility
   #) Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis vs PNA.  CXR has progressively improved and
   patient is s/p extubation on [**2162-3-12**] and generally breathing
   comfortably.
   -Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia for seven day course
   (day 1 = [**3-9**])
    #) Renal failure:  Secondary to rhabdo and ATN.  Continues to
   improve.
   - renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   #) FUO: Patient continues to have fevers despite generally improving
   clinical condition.  Cultures have all been negative so far.
   Potentially, this is all neurogenic fever, drug fever, and/or resolving
   vasculitis but also possible line infection or choleycystitis (unlikely
   with falling LFT
s).  If cultures remain negative would probably
   proceed to CT chest to rule out complicated effusion/empyema.
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
   -check WBC differential
   #) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Culture results benign.
   #) Hypernatremia:  This has resolved with free water boluses and
   presumably was due to insensible losses.
   - check p.m. sodium level
   #)PPX: SC Heparin, no further indication for acid suppression so
   stopped
   #) FEN: Tube feeds
   #) Code Status: Presumed full
   #) Dispo: C/O to floor, will presumably need long term placement
   afterward.

","The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with anoxic brain injury, hypoxemic respiratory failure, renal failure, fever of unknown origin (FUO), skin rash, hypernatremia, and previous pressure ulcers.

Based on the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of anoxic brain injury: The patient's mental status should be closely followed as he is still difficult to understand and reports inability to move his hands or feet.

2. Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient's condition has improved since extubation, there is still a risk of developing pneumonia or VAP due to his history of respiratory failure and aspiration.

3. Renal failure: While the patient's renal failure is secondary to rhabdo and acute tubular necrosis (ATN), it is important to continue monitoring kidney function and avoiding nephrotoxins.

4. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient continues to have fevers despite generally improving clinical condition. Cultures have all been negative so far. Monitoring fever and leukocytosis curves, checking WBC differential, and ruling out complicated effusion/empyema through CT chest may be necessary.

5. Skin breakdown: The rashes on the medial knees appear most consistent with friction/pressure-induced injury. Regular skin assessment is important"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation
   and respiratory failure.
    #) Anoxic brain injury:  Patient has presentation and symptoms most
   consistent with anoxic brain injury.  Neurology in agreement and MRI
   and EEG consistent with that diagnosis.  Had very minimal
   responsiveness while intubated but currently responding intermittently
   appropriately to simple questions.  Still difficult to understand and
   reports unable to move hands or feets.  Ventilating and oxygenating
   well since extubated.
   -follow mental status
   -will likely need placement to long term rehab/care facility
   #) Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis vs PNA.  CXR has progressively improved and
   patient is s/p extubation on [**2162-3-12**] and generally breathing
   comfortably.
   -Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia for seven day course
   (day 1 = [**3-9**])
    #) Renal failure:  Secondary to rhabdo and ATN.  Continues to
   improve.
   - renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   #) FUO: Patient continues to have fevers despite generally improving
   clinical condition.  Cultures have all been negative so far.
   Potentially, this is all neurogenic fever, drug fever, and/or resolving
   vasculitis but also possible line infection or choleycystitis (unlikely
   with falling LFT
s).  If cultures remain negative would probably
   proceed to CT chest to rule out complicated effusion/empyema.
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
   -check WBC differential
   #) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Culture results benign.
   #) Hypernatremia:  This has resolved with free water boluses and
   presumably was due to insensible losses.
   - check p.m. sodium level
   #)PPX: SC Heparin, no further indication for acid suppression so
   stopped
   #) FEN: Tube feeds
   #) Code Status: Presumed full
   #) Dispo: C/O to floor, will presumably need long term placement
   afterward.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with anoxic brain injury, hypoxemic respiratory failure, renal failure, fever of unknown origin (FUO), skin rashes on the medial knees, hypernatremia, and previous placement of a subclavian IJ. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Neurological complications: Given the diagnosis of anoxic brain injury, the patient may experience ongoing neurological deficits such as impaired mental status, movement disorders, and sensory deficits.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of respiratory failure increases the risk of further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Renal complications: The patient's renal failure secondary to rhabdo and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) should be closely monitored for any deterioration in renal function.
4. Infection-related complications: Despite negative cultures so far, the patient continues to have fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection. This increases the risk of developing new infections or complications related to existing infections.
5. Skin complications: The friction/pressure-induced rashes on the medial knees should be monitored for any signs of worsening or infection.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure that electrolyte imbalances"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation and respiratory failure.
- The patient has anoxic brain injury with a prognosis not favorable, as confirmed by neurology and supported by MRI findings.
- The patient is suspected to have hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia or PNA. He was extubated on [**2162-3-12**] and is currently breathing comfortably.
- The patient has renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Creatinine levels are falling, and medications are being renally dosed.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, which is trending down. Monitoring fever and leukocytosis curves is important.
- Skin rashes on the medial knees appear consistent with friction/pressure-induced injury, but cultures are being obtained from vesicles.
- The patient has hypernatremia, likely secondary to insensible losses and possibly related to intracranial injury. Free water deficit is being corrected with D5W.
- The patient is on prophylactic heparin and tube feeds. Code status is presumed full.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Extensive areas of restricted diffusion involving the white matter, corpus callosum, both globus pallidus, and right hippocampus indicative of acute infarct/ischemia likely due to global hypoxia.

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y.o. male with hx of polysubstance abuse presenting with obtundation
   and respiratory failure.
    #) Anoxic brain injury:  Patient has presentation and symptoms most
   consistent with anoxic brain injury.  Neurology in agreement and MRI
   and EEG consistent with that diagnosis.  Had very minimal
   responsiveness while intubated but currently responding intermittently
   appropriately to simple questions.  Still difficult to understand and
   reports unable to move hands or feets.  Ventilating and oxygenating
   well since extubated.
   -follow mental status
   -will likely need placement to long term rehab/care facility
   #) Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Most likely etiologies include
   aspiration pneumonitis vs PNA.  CXR has progressively improved and
   patient is s/p extubation on [**2162-3-12**] and generally breathing
   comfortably.
   -Ampicillin-Sublactam for aspiration pneumonia for seven day course
   (day 1 = [**3-9**])
    #) Renal failure:  Secondary to rhabdo and ATN.  Continues to
   improve.
   - renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   #) FUO: Patient continues to have fevers despite generally improving
   clinical condition.  Cultures have all been negative so far.
   Potentially, this is all neurogenic fever, drug fever, and/or resolving
   vasculitis but also possible line infection or choleycystitis (unlikely
   with falling LFT
s).  If cultures remain negative would probably
   proceed to CT chest to rule out complicated effusion/empyema.
   -Monitor fever and leukocytosis curves.
   -check WBC differential
   #) Skin: Rashes on medial knees appear most consistent with
   friction/pressure induced injury.  Culture results benign.
   #) Hypernatremia:  This has resolved with free water boluses and
   presumably was due to insensible losses.
   - check p.m. sodium level
   #)PPX: SC Heparin, no further indication for acid suppression so
   stopped
   #) FEN: Tube feeds
   #) Code Status: Presumed full
   #) Dispo: C/O to floor, will presumably need long term placement
   afterward.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who presented with obtundation and respiratory failure. The patient's symptoms are consistent with anoxic brain injury, as indicated by minimal responsiveness while intubated, intermittent appropriate responses to simple questions, and difficulty understanding and moving hands or feet. The patient has been ventilated and oxygenated well since extubation.

The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, for which ampicillin-sublactam has been started for a seven-day course. The patient's renal function is improving after secondary renal failure due to rhabdo and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Medications are being renally dosed and nephrotoxins are being avoided.

The patient continues to have fevers despite an improving clinical condition, which may be neurogenic fever, drug fever, or resolving vasculitis. Cultures have been negative so far, but further investigation may include a CT chest to rule out complicated effusion/empyema if cultures remain negative.

The patient has skin rashes on the medial knees that appear consistent with friction/pressure-induced injury, and culture results are benign. Hypernatremia has resolved with free water boluses and was likely due to insensible losses.

Other interventions include prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), discontinuation of acid suppression,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old male admitted from a detox unit with an unknown drug overdose, seizures (LP negative), likely aspiration pneumonia with severe rhabdomyolysis. He now shows evidence of anoxic brain injury. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 149/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. His physical examination shows well-nourished appearance without acute distress. The patient's neurologic status is intermittently following simple commands, answering yes/no questions, but unclear accuracy of responses. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormalities in electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and a chest X-ray has been ordered. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's brain injury may lead to long-term neurological deficits or disability.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's risk of developing pneumonia is high due to his compromised respiratory function and potential aspiration events.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's severe muscle breakdown may result in kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Fever: The patient's fever could be due to an infection or neurogenic cause. It is important"
