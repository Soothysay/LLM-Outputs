","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a previous stroke. He was admitted on 3-26 with urinary retention following a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). During cardiac catheterization, the patient was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) with LM ostial lesion, LCx, and RCA total occlusions. PCI for 3VD was deferred for CT surgery evaluation. The patient was initially chest pain-free but developed chest pain after rounds this morning, which resolved with nitroglycerin. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 40%.

Given the recurrent chest pain, emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is being considered without full clopidogrel washout due to recurrent chest pain. The timing of surgery will depend on the international normalized ratio (INR). Additional tests ordered include a CT chest to evaluate the aorta and carotid ultrasound. Medications include continuing lisinopril (uptitrate to 40 mg daily), metoprolol, nitroglycerin for chest pain, holding coumadin pre-operatively, and continuing atorvastatin.

The patient's other conditions include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a previous stroke. He was admitted on [**3-26**] with urinary retention and was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). During cardiac catheterization, the patient was discovered to have triple vessel disease (3VD) with LM ostial lesion, LCx, and RCA total occlusions. PCI was deferred for CT surgery evaluation. The patient is currently without chest pain, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's plan includes CT surgery evaluation to assess suitability for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), which is likely to be performed next week after clopidogrel washout. The patient will continue on [**Last Name (LF) 119**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**], lisinopril (uptitrate to 40 mg daily), and statin therapy. Metoprolol use will be limited due to bradycardia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a previous stroke. He was admitted on [**3-26**] with urinary retention following a NSTEMI. The patient has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed triple vessel disease with LM ostial lesion, LCx, and RCA total occlusions. 

The patient experienced chest pain overnight but it resolved with nitroglycerin. Due to recurrent chest pain and moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40%, emergent CABG surgery has been planned without full clopidogrel washout. The timing of surgery will depend on the INR level. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/55 to 162/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, mild bibasilar crackles, and weak peripheral pulses. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated glucose levels, prolonged PT/PTT/INR, and abnormal calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient is currently on multiple medications including omeprazole, lisinopril, metoprolol, nitroglycerin, and statin.

The patient's allergies are negative, and he is NPO since Sunday evening. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the CCU for further evaluation and consideration of emergent CABG surgery."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous stroke, admitted on [**3-26**] for urinary retention following a NSTEMI.
- The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have triple vessel disease with LM ostial lesion, LCx, and RCA total occlusions. PCI was deferred for CT surgery evaluation.
- The patient experienced chest pain (CP) overnight, which resolved with nitroglycerin. He then developed CP again after rounds this morning, which also resolved with nitro.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%.
- Due to recurrent CP, emergent CABG was planned without full clopidogrel washout. The timing of surgery will depend on INR.
- A CT chest was performed to evaluate the aorta and showed calcifications throughout. Carotid ultrasound was also done, but the results are pending.
- The patient continues on various medications including lisinopril, metoprolol, nitroglycerin, statin, and insulin sliding scale.
- The patient has an erythematous base at the coccyx with a non-draining but open pore, which is being treated with local bacitracin and wound care.
- The patient's other medical conditions include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2).
- The patient had a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke with expressive aphasia on [**7-/2104**] and is currently on chronic warfarin anticoagulation. Coumadin is being held pre-operatively.
- The patient has urinary retention likely related to prostatic disease. Foley catheter is in place, and tamsulosin is being continued.
- The patient's ICU care includes cardiac/diabetic nutrition, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the CCU awaiting evaluation by CT surgery for consideration of emergent CABG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent chest pain (CP): The patient experienced two episodes of CP, which resolved with nitroglycerin. It is important to closely monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication as necessary to prevent further episodes of CP.
2. Infection: The presence of an erythematous base at the coccyx with a non-draining but open pore raises concerns for a potential skin infection. Close observation and appropriate wound care are necessary to prevent any complications.
3. Postoperative bleeding: The patient is currently on systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin for DVT proph"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a previous stroke with residual expressive aphasia. He was admitted on [**3-26**] with urinary retention following a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) with LM ostial lesion, LCx, and RCA total occlusions. PCI was deferred for CT surgery evaluation. The patient experienced chest pain overnight but resolved with nitroglycerin. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%.

The patient is now being considered for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without full clopidogrel washout due to recurrent chest pain. The timing of surgery will depend on the international normalized ratio (INR). A CT chest to evaluate the aorta showed calcifications throughout; carotid ultrasound is pending.

The patient's current medications include [**Last Name (LF) 119**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold clopidogrel, lisinopril (uptitrate to 40 mg daily), metoprolol, nitroglycerin drip for chest pain/blood pressure control, and statin."

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a previous stroke. He was admitted on [**3-26**] with urinary retention following a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has three-vessel coronary artery disease and is being evaluated for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He experienced chest pain but responded to nitroglycerin and has been pain-free since then. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/47-175/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on a nasal cannula. He is on mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination reveals dependent crackles and wheezes throughout the lungs, no murmurs or gallops appreciated, and widespread wheezing throughout the abdomen. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with no apparent neurological deficits. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests including elevated creatinine and potassium levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   76y/o gentleman with a PMH of diabetes mellitus, HTN, h/o stroke with
   residual expressive aphasia admitted on [**3-26**] with urinary retention s/p
   NSTEMI found to have 3vd on cardiac catheterization.
   # NSTEMI - The patient was found to have 3 vessel disease and was
   evaluated for CT surgery. Pt had some chest pain, which resolved with
   nitro.  Has remained free of CP since. TTE demonstrates moderate
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis with EF 40%.
   - plan for CABG on Monday
   - continue [**Last Name (LF) 119**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold clopidogrel
   - Continue lisinopril and metoprolol; continue statin
   - Nitro gtt for CP
   - heparin gtt while pt has INR<2
   #  HTN
 continue lisinopril, metoprolol, nitro gtt
   # Hypercholesterolemia - continue atorvastatin
   # DM2 - continue insulin sliding scale
   # H/o L MCA Stroke  - On chronic warfarin anticoagulation. Holding
   coumadin pre-operatively.
   - on heparin gtt while INR<2

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of stroke. He was admitted on [**3-26**] with urinary retention following a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). During his stay in the ICU, the patient experienced an episode of chest pain that responded to nitroglycerin. He has been chest pain-free since then. His blood pressures have been stable. The patient was evaluated for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and has moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. The plan for CABG is on Monday. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/34 mmHg to 175/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals dependent crackles and wheezes throughout his lungs, and he has a Foley catheter in place for urinary retention. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. His blood glucose levels have been elevated, with values ranging from 138 mg/dL to 168 mg/dL. His proth"
