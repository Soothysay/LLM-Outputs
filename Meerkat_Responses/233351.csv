   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.  At time of this note, does not have
   access and will be priority to attempt peripheral IV for now.  See
   below for discussion of other current issues.
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt persistently hypotensive since initiation of CVVH,
   etiology unclear but differential includes septic shock, adrenal
   insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, hepatorenal syndrome, auto PEEP.
   - Will do cortisol stimulation test today to eval for adrenal
   insufficiency
   - ECHO to eval for structural heart disease
   - Continuing on Neosynephrine
   # Respiratory Distress: most likely from fluid overload, although chest
   xray is consistent with possible ARDS.  She is in oliguric renal
   failure and no responding to diuretics.
   - continue bipap for now, but unlikely to tolerate in long run
   - elective intubation for procedures including placement of HD line
   - Will attempt to remove fluid via CVVH as BP tolerates
   - serial CXRs
   - place a-line for ABG monitoring
   - continuing Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro
   - Will f/u blood cx, f/u BAL results
   .
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome.  Unclear when patient stopped making urine.  She is on
   octreotide and midodrine.  Electrolytes stable with K+ of 5 today.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - renal consult following
   - place HD line for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy.
   - liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined below
   - follow up liver US with Doppler-
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin.  Vanco added last night for broader coverage.
   - obtain culture data from outside hospital
   - continue current abx
   - consider diagnostic tap, abdomen exam benign here
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabalized
   .
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - transfuse 1 u platelets pre-procedure if possible
   - Will check PM CBC
   - will give one dose of DDAVP
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - holding all HIV meds, given NPO status
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: one peripheral, will need HD line placed and central access
   either with PICC line v. CVL
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not
   know HIV or Hep C status
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented to the hospital for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory decompensation in the setting of fluid overload. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60%. She has hypotension, respiratory distress, oliguric renal failure, and coagulopathy.

The patient's current medical conditions include SBP, HRS, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hypothyroidism, COPD, and liver disease. She is also diagnosed with HIV.

The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates metabolic acidosis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, hepatorenal syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient will undergo further diagnostic tests and treatments to address these conditions and prevent any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.  At time of this note, does not have
   access and will be priority to attempt peripheral IV for now.  See
   below for discussion of other current issues.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: most likely from fluid overload, although chest
   xray is consistent with possible ARDS.  She is in oliguric renal
   failure and no responding to diuretics.
   - continue bipap for now, but unlikely to tolerate in long run
   - elective intubation for procedures including placement of HD line
   - diurese with Ethacrynate and Chlorothiazide if possible
   - serial CXRs
   - place a-line for ABG monitoring
   - have neo ready for intubation related hypotension
   - consider broadening abx for PNA coverage; will discuss with ID
   .
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome.  Unclear when patient stopped making urine.  She is on
   octreotide and midodrine.  Electrolytes stable with K+ of 5 today.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - renal consult following
   - place HD line for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy.
   - liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined below
   - follow up liver US with doppler
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin.  Vanco added last night for broader coverage.
   - obtain culture data from outside hospital
   - continue current abx
   - consider diagnostic tap, abdomen exam benign here
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabalized
   .
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - transfuse 1 u platelets pre-procedure if possible
   - will give one dose of DDAVP
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - continue home meds for now
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: one peripheral, will need HD line placed and central access
   either with PICC line v. CVL
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not
   know HIV or Hep C status
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a medical history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). However, she experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, oliguric renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, anemia, and hypothyroidism.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which may progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required.

2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient is in oliguric renal failure, indicating decreased urine output. This condition can worsen if not managed appropriately. Dialysis may be necessary.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and neurological symptoms. This condition requires careful management to prevent further deterioration.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as platelet transfusion, may be required.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR, indicating impaired"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.  At time of this note, does not have
   access and will be priority to attempt peripheral IV for now.  See
   below for discussion of other current issues.
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt persistently hypotensive since initiation of CVVH,
   etiology unclear but differential includes septic shock, adrenal
   insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, hepatorenal syndrome, auto PEEP.
   - Pt has evidence of adrenal insufficiency per cortisol stim test
   yesterday
   - Stress dose steroids initiated, and subsequently able to reduce
   pressor requirements
   - Removing approximately 75- 100 cc/hour as tolerated by pressure
   - ECHO to eval for structural heart disease on Monday
   - Continuing on Neosynephrine
   # Respiratory Distress: most likely from fluid overload, although chest
   xray is consistent with possible ARDS.  She is in oliguric renal
   failure and no responding to diuretics.
   - continue bipap for now, but unlikely to tolerate in long run
   - elective intubation for procedures including placement of HD line
   - Will attempt to remove fluid via CVVH as BP tolerates
   - serial CXRs
   - place a-line for ABG monitoring
   - continuing Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro
   - Will f/u blood cx, f/u BAL results
   .
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome.  Unclear when patient stopped making urine.  She is on
   octreotide and midodrine.  Electrolytes stable.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - renal consult following
   - place HD line for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy.
   - liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined below
   - follow up liver US with Doppler-
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin.  Vanco added last night for broader coverage.
   - obtain culture data from outside hospital
   - continue current abx
   - consider diagnostic tap, abdomen exam benign here
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabalized
   .
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - transfuse 1 u platelets pre-procedure if possible
   - Will check PM CBC
   - will give one dose of DDAVP
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - holding all HIV meds, given NPO status
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: one peripheral, will need HD line placed and central access
   either with PICC line v. CVL
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not
   know HIV or Hep C status
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. The patient is intubated and sedated, and she is currently on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient has evidence of adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by a failed cortisol stimulation test. Stress dose steroids were initiated, resulting in an improvement in her blood pressure. She is also receiving vasopressor support with phenylephrine.

Her respiratory distress is likely due to fluid overload, although a chest X-ray suggests possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is oliguric and not responding to diuretics. Bipap support is being continued, and elective intubation is planned for procedures, including the placement of a hemodialysis line.

The patient has oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. She is on octreotide and midodrine, and her electrolytes are stable. Renal consultation has been requested, and a HD line is being placed for potential continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) or hemodialysis (HD) for volume removal.

She has complicated Hepatitis C cirrhosis with ascites and a drain on the right side of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient presented with acute respiratory decompensation and fluid overload. She is intubated and sedated, and has evidence of adrenal insufficiency. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been persistently hypotensive since the initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), with an unclear etiology. The differential diagnosis includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, hepatorenal syndrome, and auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Stress dose steroids have been initiated, and the patient's blood pressure has improved. Pressors are still required, and CVVH is being continued.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to fluid overload, although a chest X-ray shows possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is in oliguric renal failure and not responding to diuretics. Bipap support is being continued, and elective intubation is planned for procedures including the placement of a hemodialysis line. Serial chest X-rays will be performed, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) monitor will be placed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis. She presents with management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. She is currently sedated and intubated.

The patient has been hypotensive since the initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and the cause of this hypotension is unclear. The differential diagnosis includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient failed a cortisol stimulation test yesterday, indicating evidence of adrenal insufficiency. Stress dose steroids have been initiated, and there has been an improvement in blood pressure. Pressors have been weaned down but not completely discontinued.

The patient also has respiratory distress, most likely due to fluid overload. Chest X-ray shows possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is in oliguric renal failure and is not responding to diuretics. Bipap has been continued for now, but it is unlikely to be tolerated in the long run. Elective intubation for procedures, including placement of a hemodialysis line, will be performed. CVVH will continue as tolerated by blood pressure. Serial chest X-rays will be obtained, and an arterial line will be placed for ABG monitoring. Current antibiotics will be continued, and blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.  At time of this note, does not have
   access and will be priority to attempt peripheral IV for now.  See
   below for discussion of other current issues.
   #Hypotension: Now improved with stress dose steroids. Pt persistently
   hypotensive since initiation of CVVH, etiology unclear but differential
   includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock,
   hepatorenal syndrome.
   - Pt has evidence of adrenal insufficiency per cortisol stim test
   yesterday
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Continue to reduce pressors (Neosynephrine)
   - ECHO today to eval for structural heart disease; f/u read
   # Respiratory Distress: most likely from fluid overload, although chest
   xray is consistent with possible ARDS. She is in oliguric renal failure
   and not responding to diuretics.
   - change to PEEP of 8
   - continue bipap for now, but unlikely to tolerate in long run
   - Will attempt to remove fluid via CVVH (200cc/hr) as BP tolerates
   - serial CXRs
   - place a-line for ABG monitoring
   - continuing Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro for any underlying pneumonia.
   - Will f/u blood cx, f/u BAL results
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - place HD line for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   - vancomycin trough 11.3; no change to medication.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.
   - obtain culture data from outside hospital
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # UTI: positive UA at OSH but without cultures, here with ucx growing
   100k+ entero spp sensitive to vanco as well as 10k-100k klebsiella
    - cont vanc
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - received HIV meds yesterday through OG tube
   - continue HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, try starting TFs
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: one peripheral, HD line, PICC, A-line
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not
   know HIV or Hep C status
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.  At time of this note, does not have
   access and will be priority to attempt peripheral IV for now.  See
   below for discussion of other current issues.
   #Hypotension: Now improved with stress dose steroids. Pt persistently
   hypotensive since initiation of CVVH, etiology unclear but differential
   includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock,
   hepatorenal syndrome.
   - Pt has evidence of adrenal insufficiency per cortisol stim test
   yesterday
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Continue to reduce pressors (Neosynephrine)
   - ECHO today to eval for structural heart disease; f/u read
   # Respiratory Distress: most likely from fluid overload, although chest
   xray is consistent with possible ARDS. She is in oliguric renal failure
   and not responding to diuretics.
   - change to PEEP of 8
   - continue bipap for now, but unlikely to tolerate in long run
   - Will attempt to remove fluid via CVVH (200cc/hr) as BP tolerates
   - serial CXRs
   - place a-line for ABG monitoring
   - continuing Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro for any underlying pneumonia.
   - Will f/u blood cx, f/u BAL results
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - place HD line for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   - vancomycin trough 11.3; no change to medication.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.
   - obtain culture data from outside hospital
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # UTI: positive UA at OSH but without cultures, here with ucx growing
   100k+ entero spp sensitive to vanco as well as 10k-100k klebsiella
    - cont vanc
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - received HIV meds yesterday through OG tube
   - talk to ID re: redosing her HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, try starting TFs
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: one peripheral, HD line, PICC, A-line
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not
   know HIV or Hep C status
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She has a history of SBP from an outside hospital and was being treated with ciprofloxacin. Vancomycin was added last night for broader coverage.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory decompensation in the setting of fluid overload. She has evidence of adrenal insufficiency per cortisol stimulation test yesterday and is receiving stress dose steroids. Her blood pressure is still hypotensive despite the use of vasopressors.

The patient has evidence of renal failure, which is likely oliguric due to hepatorenal syndrome. She is on octreotide and midodrine for this condition. Her electrolytes are stable, but she requires ongoing management with diuretics and fluid removal through continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient also has a history of COPD, but it is likely all fluid overload at this time. She has positive blood cultures growing enteric species sensitive to vancomycin, as well as klebsiella species. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage.

The patient has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy in the setting of chronic liver disease. An HD line will be placed today for potential CVVH or hemodialysis for"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of decompensated cirrhosis, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue, abdominal pain, and dark urine. On physical examination, the patient was found to have hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and ascites. Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver enzymes, elevated creatinine, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient was diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and started on terlipressin therapy. However, the patient's condition worsened, and he developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including respiratory failure and septic shock.

The patient was admitted to the ICU and placed on mechanical ventilation. He required aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Despite these measures, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's renal function also worsened, and he required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to oliguric AKI.

Further evaluation revealed hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's family requested to speak with the doctor regarding the patient's prognosis. The doctor explained the seriousness of the patient's condition and the potential risks and benefits of continuing aggressive treatment. The family agreed to continue with the current management plan.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.  At time of this note, does not have
   access and will be priority to attempt peripheral IV for now.  See
   below for discussion of other current issues.
   #Hypotension: Now improved with stress dose steroids. Pt persistently
   hypotensive since initiation of CVVH, etiology unclear but differential
   includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock,
   hepatorenal syndrome.
   - Pt has evidence of adrenal insufficiency per cortisol stim test
   yesterday
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Continue to reduce pressors (Neosynephrine)
   - Removing approximately 75- 100 cc/hour as tolerated by pressure
   - ECHO to eval for structural heart disease on Monday
   # Respiratory Distress: most likely from fluid overload, although chest
   xray is consistent with possible ARDS. She is in oliguric renal failure
   and not responding to diuretics.
   - continue bipap for now, but unlikely to tolerate in long run
   - elective intubation for procedures including placement of HD line
   - Will attempt to remove fluid via CVVH as BP tolerates
   - serial CXRs
   - place a-line for ABG monitoring
   - continuing Vanc/Aztreonam/Cipro
   - Will f/u blood cx, f/u BAL results
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - place HD line for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.
   - obtain culture data from outside hospital
   - continue current abx
   - consider diagnostic tap, abdomen exam benign here
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabalized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # UTI: positive UA at OSH but without cultures, here with ucx growing
   100k+ entero spp sensitive to vanco as well as 10k-100k klebsiella
    - cont vanc
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - received HIV meds yesterday through OG tube
   - talk to ID re: redosing her HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, try starting TFs
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: one peripheral, HD line, PICC, A-line
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. The patient has been receiving stress dose steroids, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), and various antibiotics. She is currently hypotensive, in oliguric renal failure, and has evidence of adrenal insufficiency. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to fluid overload, although a chest x-ray is consistent with possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has a history of SBP and HRS, and her liver function tests are abnormal. The patient also has anemia of unknown cause, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and hypothyroidism. She is being treated for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), and her HIV status is stable. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic shock: The patient has a history of SBP and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, there is still a risk of sepsis and septic shock due to the ongoing infection.
2. Adrenal crisis: The patient has evidence of adrenal insufficiency and is receiving stress dose steroids. If the steroids are not continued appropriately or if there is an inadequate response, the patient may develop an adrenal crisis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with management of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) and Hepatic Residual Syndrome (HRS). She had acute respiratory decompensation in the setting of fluid overload. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has evidence of adrenal insufficiency and is being treated with stress dose steroids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been persistently hypotensive since the initiation of Continuous Venous Hemofiltration (CVVH), with unclear etiology. Differential diagnosis includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, and hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is most likely due to fluid overload, although a chest x-ray suggests possible Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She is in oliguric renal failure and not responding to diuretics.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient likely has oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal syndrome. It is unclear when the patient stopped making urine. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes are stable.
4. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has a history of SBP from an outside hospital and was being treated with ciprofloxacin. Vancom"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV (well controlled), HCV (poorly controlled), cirrhosis of the liver, portal hypertension, and previous treatment for hydrothorax. She has had several previous admissions for gastrointestinal bleeding, SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), ARF (acute renal failure), and HRS (hepatorenal syndrome). The patient is currently in the ICU for liver failure, renal failure, and respiratory failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
2. Hepatorenal syndrome
3. Metabolic acidosis
4. Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS)
5. Acute renal failure (likely HRS)

Medical Complications:
1. Liver failure due to ESLD (end-stage liver disease)
2. Renal failure due to HRS (hepatorenal syndrome) or ARF (acute renal failure)
3. Respiratory failure
4. Adrenal insufficiency
5. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
6. Potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
7. Stress ulcers
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Treatment:
1. Continue CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) at an increased rate of 200cc/hr.
2. Continue octreotide and midodrine for management of HRS"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Respiratory Distress: significantly improved, achieving good tidal
   volumes with minimal support. Chest x ray notably improved from
   admission. Now maintaining good ABGs on SBT. Original etiology most
   likely fluid overload in context of oliguric renal failure not
   responding to diuretics.
   - plan to extubate today
   - Will continue to remove fluid via CVVH (200cc/hr) as BP tolerates
   - continuing Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for any underlying pneumonia.
   - serial CXRs
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 90s on stress dose
   steroids but now off pressors. ECHO w/out evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. Pt was initially persistently hypotensive since initiation of
   CVVH, etiology unclear but differential includes septic shock, adrenal
   insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, hepatorenal syndrome. Pt has evidence
   of adrenal insufficiency per cortisol stim test.
   - Reduce stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h
   # Possible DIC: initially with anemia and thrombocytopenia concerning
   for DIC, now unlikely given stable fibrinogen
   - Transfuse 1 unit platelets this AM
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC q6h
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q12 per ID recs
   - Check daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   - vancomycin trough 11.3; no change to medication.
   # Hyponatremia
to 133 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - received HIV meds yesterday through OG tube
   - continue HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
   - SW saw patient yesterday, son is coming home from [**Country 8643**]. He does not
   know of her HIV status.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, try starting TFs
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: HD line, PICC, A-line
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not
   know HIV or Hep C status
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory distress in the setting of fluid overload and required intubation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/56 mmHg to 121/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is sedated, intubated, and follows simple commands.

The patient's physical examination reveals tense edema throughout, without clubbing or cyanosis. Her abdominal examination shows a tense, distended abdomen with no rebound or guarding. Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and renal failure.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory distress: Improved significantly, achieving good tidal volumes with minimal support. Chest X-ray notably improved from admission. Now maintaining good arterial blood gas (ABG) values on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Original etiology most likely fluid overload in the context of oliguric renal failure not responding to diuretics. Plan to extubate today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an intubated individual in the ICU. They were able to have their pressors titrated down and increase CVVH to remove 200 cc/h, which their pressure tolerated. A curbsided ID for klebsiella/enterococcus UTI that is ESBL was identified, and the patient was switched from aztreonam to meropenem and added on tigacycline and colistin based on sensitivities.

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), angioedema with Aldactone (spironolactone), hives with penicillins, and blisters with Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim). The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin at 10:00 AM, aztreonam at 05:56 PM, ciprofloxacin at 06:53 PM, and meropenem at 08:15 PM.

Infusions include fentanyl at 30 mcg/hour, and other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:15 PM. The patient is also receiving NovaSource Renal (full) nutrition at 30 mL/hour.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5 C (97.7 F), heart rate of 57 bpm (53"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Respiratory Distress: most likely from fluid overload, although chest
   xray is consistent with possible ARDS. She is in oliguric renal failure
   and not responding to diuretics.
   - Pt
s respiratory status improving w/ fluid removal
   - PEEP now to 5
   - continue bipap for now
   - Will attempt to remove fluid via CVVH (200cc/hr) as BP tolerates
   - serial CXRs
   - place a-line for ABG monitoring
   - continuing Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for any underlying pneumonia.
   - Will f/u blood cx, f/u BAL results
   .
   #Hypotension: Now improved with stress dose steroids. Pt persistently
   hypotensive since initiation of CVVH, etiology unclear but differential
   includes septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock,
   hepatorenal syndrome.
   - Pt has evidence of adrenal insufficiency per cortisol stim test
   - Continue stress dose steroids 100 mg IV q8h, consider taper
   - Pt now off pressors
   - ECHO w/out evidence of cardiogenic shock
   .
   # Possible DIC:
   - Pt w/ anemia, thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC
   - Transfuse 1 unit platelets this AM
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC q4h
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   - vancomycin trough 11.3; no change to medication.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.
   - obtain culture data from outside hospital
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - received HIV meds yesterday through OG tube
   - continue HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, try starting TFs
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: one peripheral, HD line, PICC, A-line
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not
   know HIV or Hep C status
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented to the ICU for management of SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and HRS (hepatorenal syndrome). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory status has improved with fluid removal and the use of CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration). The patient's hypotension has improved with the use of stress dose steroids, but she remains oliguric with renal failure. There are concerns for possible DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), ARF (acute renal failure), and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The patient also has a history of SBP, Hepatitis C cirrhosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hypothyroidism, and COPD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status can worsen if there is fluid overload or development of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may further decrease due to septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, or hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Possible DIC: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia could progress to DIC, leading to bleeding and organ dysfunction.
4. ARF: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include liver failure, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and mechanically ventilated.

The patient has a history of HIV (well controlled), HCV (poorly controlled), and has undergone liver transplantation (ESLD) with portal hypertension. They also have a past medical history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), sepsis, and hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's current lab results show hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia. They are also positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae in their urine.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels need to be managed.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: This is a complication of liver disease that affects the kidneys.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an imbalance in their blood pH due to excess acid or loss of bicarbonate.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and requires mechanical ventilation.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may have an underactive adrenal gland.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments, including CRRT"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt
s overall respiratory function markedly
   improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on RA,
   hemodynamically stable
   - Continuing CVVH for fluid removal at 200cc/hour as BP tolerates
   - Continue Vancomycin/Meropenem for PNA coverage
   .
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors,
   tolerating CVVH well
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h, consider taper
   tomorrow
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider starting epogen with HD once on HD
   - Consider heme/onc consult for etiology of heme abnormalities
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP 100cc/day
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Continue meropenem to 1g q12 per ID recs
   - F/U daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   - vancomycin trough 11.3; no change to medication.
   .
   # Hyponatremia
to 132 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**] yesterday. Will re-visit today
   - Will call SW to provide support for Pt in possibly disclosing HIV
   status to son who is HCP
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, start on soft diet today
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient had acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated but is now extubated and breathing comfortably on room air.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's overall respiratory function has improved significantly since being extubated. However, there is a potential risk of respiratory distress due to fluid overload.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has stabilized in the 100s-120s range and is off pressors, tolerating continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) well. There is a goal to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 55.
3. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient initially had anemia and thrombocytopenia concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, the fibrinogen level has decreased again, indicating a possible ongoing bleeding risk. The patient will be transfused for hemoglobin concentration (Hct) less than 21 and platelets less than 10 or signs of active bleeding.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has oliguric renal failure secondary to HRS"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Respiratory Distress: significantly improved, achieving good tidal
   volumes with minimal support. Chest x ray notably improved from
   admission. Now maintaining good ABGs on SBT. Original etiology most
   likely fluid overload in context of oliguric renal failure not
   responding to diuretics.
   - plan to extubate today
   - Will continue to remove fluid via CVVH (200cc/hr) as BP tolerates
   - continuing Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for any underlying pneumonia.
   - serial CXRs
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 90s on stress dose
   steroids but now off pressors. ECHO w/out evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. Pt was initially persistently hypotensive since initiation of
   CVVH, etiology unclear but differential includes septic shock, adrenal
   insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, hepatorenal syndrome. Pt has evidence
   of adrenal insufficiency per cortisol stim test.
   - Reduce stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h
   # Possible DIC: initially with anemia and thrombocytopenia concerning
   for DIC, now unlikely given stable fibrinogen
   - Transfuse 1 unit platelets this AM
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC q6h
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q12 per ID recs
   - Check daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   - vancomycin trough 11.3; no change to medication.
   # Hyponatremia
to 133 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - received HIV meds yesterday through OG tube
   - continue HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
   - SW saw patient yesterday, son is coming home from [**Country 8643**]. He does not
   know of her HIV status.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, try starting TFs
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: HD line, PICC, A-line
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not
   know HIV or Hep C status

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt
s overall respiratory function markedly
   improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on RA,
   hemodynamically stable
   - Continuing CVVH for fluid removal at 200cc/hour as BP tolerates
   - Continue Vancomycin/Meropenem for PNA coverage
   .
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors,
   tolerating CVVH well
   - Continuing stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h
   # Possible DIC: initially with anemia and thrombocytopenia concerning
   for DIC, now unlikely given stable fibrinogen
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider heme/onc consult for etiology of heme abnormalities
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q12 per ID recs
   - Check daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   - vancomycin trough 11.3; no change to medication.
   .
   # Hyponatremia
to 132 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - received HIV meds yesterday through OG tube
   - continue HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**] yesterday. Will re-visit today
   - Will call SW to provide support for Pt in possibly disclosing HIV
   status to son who is HCP
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, try starting TFs
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis, presented to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient experienced acute respiratory distress and was intubated but is now extubated and breathing comfortably on room air. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, and she is tolerating continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) well. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's overall respiratory function has markedly improved since extubation. Continue CVVH for fluid removal at 200cc/hour as tolerated. Continue vancomycin and meropenem for pneumonia coverage.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is resolving and remains in the 100s-120s range, off pressors, and tolerating CVVH well. Continue stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h.
3. Possible Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): Initially concerning for DIC due to anemia and thrombocytopenia, but now unlikely given stable fibrinogen levels. Transfuse for Hct <21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding. Consider heme/onc consult for etiology of heme abnormalities.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient tolerated well after being extubated and maintained stable blood pressure in the 100s-120s. However, he was noted to be bradycardic in the 50s, with an unclear etiology. The patient is tolerating 200cc/hour fluid removal via CVVH. His repeat CBC shows stable platelets and hematocrit at 10pm.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently in the 50s, which is considered bradycardia. The etiology of this condition is unclear and needs further investigation to determine the cause and appropriate management.

2. Fluid Balance: The patient has had a significant amount of fluid input and output over the 24-hour period, with a net negative fluid balance of -5,502 mL. This indicates that more fluid has been removed from the patient than has been given to him. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid status is essential to ensure adequate hydration and prevent complications related to fluid overload or underload.

3. Kidney Function: The patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), as evidenced by the CVVH mentioned in the note. This indicates a concern for impaired kidney function or acute kidney injury (AKI). Regular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV (well controlled), HCV (poorly controlled), cirrhosis, acute renal failure, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications including septic shock, hepatorenal syndrome, respiratory failure, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's current condition includes hyperkalemia, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She is currently extubated and doing well, but still requires ongoing medical support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis. It can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening kidney dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced acute respiratory failure, which may be due to various causes such as pneumonia, sepsis, or acute lung injury. This condition can result in difficulty breathing and inadequate oxygenation of the blood.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute renal failure, which means that her kidneys are not functioning properly. This can lead to a buildup of waste products and fluid imbalances in the body.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated levels of potassium in her blood, known as hyperkalemia. If left untreated, this condition can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other serious complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. The patient has been experiencing worsening mental status, sluggishness, and difficulty with bowel movements. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding his fluid balance, as he has received a significant amount of fluid and has a negative fluid balance. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's ABG results show a slightly alkalotic pH of 7.45. The patient's laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's WBC count is within normal range, while his platelet count is low. Other lab values show abnormalities in liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's low WBC count and elevated inflammatory markers (such as lactic acid) may indicate an underlying infection.
2. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest possible acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (high potassium) require close monitoring and correction.
4. Coagulopathy"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt
s overall respiratory function markedly
   improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on RA,
   hemodynamically stable
   - Continuing CVVH for fluid removal at 200cc/hour as BP tolerates
   - Continue Vancomycin/Meropenem for PNA coverage
   .
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors,
   tolerating CVVH well
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h, consider taper
   tomorrow
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider starting epogen with HD once on HD
   - Consider heme/onc consult for etiology of heme abnormalities
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP 100cc/day
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Continue meropenem to 1g q12 per ID recs
   - F/U daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   - vancomycin trough 11.3; no change to medication.
   .
   # Hyponatremia
to 132 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**] yesterday. Will re-visit today
   - Will call SW to provide support for Pt in possibly disclosing HIV
   status to son who is HCP
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, start on soft diet today
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy

   Arterial Line - [**2200-4-4**] 03:00 PM
   Dialysis Catheter - [**2200-4-4**] 05:30 PM
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, although note that son does not
   know HIV status
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending discontinuation of CVVH

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented from outside the hospital for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. She was extubated and is now breathing comfortably on room air, hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient had resolving hypotension but may require close monitoring and appropriate interventions to maintain stable blood pressure.
2. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has evidence of possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with anemia and thrombocytopenia. She may require blood transfusions for hematocrit <21 and platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal syndrome. Her urine output is 100cc/day, and she is on octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes are stable, but renal function should be closely monitored.
4. Hepatitis C/Cirrhosis: The patient has complicated Hepatitis C cirrhosis with ascites and coagulopathy. Her bilirubin levels are elevated, and she may require further evaluation and management of her liver disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt
s overall respiratory function markedly
   improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on RA,
   hemodynamically stable
   - Continuing CVVH for fluid removal at 200cc/hour as BP tolerates
   - Continue Vancomycin/Meropenem for PNA coverage
   .
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors,
   tolerating CVVH well
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h, consider taper
   tomorrow
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider starting epogen with HD once on HD
   - Consider heme/onc consult for etiology of heme abnormalities
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP 100cc/day
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Continue meropenem to 1g q12 per ID recs
   - F/U daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   - vancomycin trough 11.3; no change to medication.
   .
   # Hyponatremia
to 132 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Anemia: has anemia from unknown source.  Likely is multifactorial
   with possible bleed from either GI or other source.  Also likely low
   production in the setting of chronic disease.  Is s/p transfusion
   without appropriate bump in hct.  Was transfused 2 u PRBCs at OSH.
   - continue serial hcts, q8h
   - transfuse for hct <21
   - add on iron studies, vit b12, folate
   - guiac all stools
   - continue protonix
   - hemolysis labs
   # Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of chronic liver disease; has
   evidence of bleeding although the source in not obvious.  Will be
   having HD line placed today.
   - Will check CBC q8 hours, transfuse to 10
   - consider DDAVP if plt fall < 10 or bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds (and lamivudine)
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**] yesterday. Will re-visit today
   - Will call SW to provide support for Pt in possibly disclosing HIV
   status to son who is HCP
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, removing volume with
   CVVH, start on soft diet today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis. The patient presented to the hospital for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory function has improved, and she is extubated, breathing comfortably on room air, and hemodynamically stable.
- She is continuing CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration) for fluid removal at 200cc/hour as her blood pressure tolerates it.
- She is receiving vancomycin and meropenem for pneumonia coverage.
- Her hypotension is resolving, and she is maintaining stable blood pressures in the 100s-120s without the need for pressors.
- She will continue stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h, considering tapering tomorrow.
- She has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Her fibrinogen level has increased but is now decreased again.
- She is oliguric with renal failure secondary to HRS. Her urine output is 100cc/day.
- She is on octreotide and midodrine, and her electrolytes are stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who was admitted for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. She has been treated with lactulose for altered mental status, CVVH for respiratory distress and volume overload, and antibiotics for SBP. She also has hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, hypothyroidism, COPD, adrenal insufficiency, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to encephalopathy, which is a common complication in patients with liver cirrhosis.
2. Infection: Infections are common in patients with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for SBP, but other infections should be considered.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing oliguric renal failure, which can be a complication of HRS. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status should be closely monitored due to her history of TIPS procedure and chronic liver disease.
5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's liver function should be closely monitored due to her Hep"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV, HCV, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension who is currently admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and respiratory failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on several medications, including HAART for HIV and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and she is unable to provide her own medical history due to encephalopathy. She has had worsening mental status, but a head CT showed no bleeding. The patient is on CRRT for renal failure and has been receiving various antibiotics for suspected infections. Her blood work shows hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated liver enzymes. She also has thrombocytopenia and a low fibrinogen level. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is currently being treated for hepatic encephalopathy and renal failure. Potential complications include further deterioration of mental status, development of additional infections, and progression of liver and kidney dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is already worsening, and she is at risk for further deterioration due to hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Infections: Given the patient's immunocompromised state (HIV) and the use of invasive lines and catheters, she is at increased risk for developing infections such"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Noticed yesterday afternoon that the patient
   was not verbal and not responding well to command.  Diff dx includes
   encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of negative CT), delirium,
   ileus.  Head CT was negative.  Infection also a possibility. Blinks to
   threat.  No obvious seizure activity
   - Lactulose to decrease ammonia
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   - Deferring LP for now in setting of bleeding risk
   - Will continue lactulose and consider MRI in AM if MS not improved
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt
s overall respiratory
   function markedly improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on
   RA, hemodynamically stable.  CVVH was continued until 5am this am due
   to clot.
   - Starting HD this morning with ultrafiltration per renal
   -
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors,
   tolerating CVVH well
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids to 50 mg q12h
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider starting epogen with HD
   - Consider heme/onc consult for etiology of heme abnormalities
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP 100cc/day
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q24 per pharmacy
   - F/U daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Hyponatremia
to 132 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h, attempt lactulose PR today
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out yesterday and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, place NGT and consider
   starting TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: PICC Line - [**2200-4-4**] 02:00 PM
   Arterial Line - [**2200-4-4**] 03:00 PM
   Dialysis Catheter - [**2200-4-4**] 05:30 PM
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, - family is aware of HepC and HIV
   although they do not like to openly discuss this
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending hemodialysis

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented with management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload.

Current Assessment:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been unresponsive and not verbalizing, with a differential diagnosis including encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), delirium, ileus, and infection. A head CT was negative, ruling out ICH. Lactulose has been initiated to decrease ammonia levels, and blood and urine cultures have been ordered. The patient's mental status will be closely monitored, and an MRI may be considered if the mental status does not improve.

2. Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: The patient's respiratory function has improved significantly after being extubated and placed on room air. The patient is now hemodynamically stable, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) was continued until 5 AM due to clot formation. The plan is to start hemodialysis this morning with ultrafiltration for renal support.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is resolving, maintaining systolic blood pressures in the 100s-"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Noticed yesterday afternoon that the patient
   was not verbal and not responding well to command.  Diff dx includes
   encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of negative CT), delirium,
   ileus.  Head CT was negative.  Infection also a possibility. Blinks to
   threat.  No obvious seizure activity
   - Lactulose to decrease ammonia
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt
s overall respiratory
   function markedly improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on
   RA, hemodynamically stable.  CVVH was continued until 5am this am due
   to clot.
   - Starting HD this morning with ultrafiltration per renal
   - Continue Vancomycin/Meropenem for PNA coverage
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors,
   tolerating CVVH well
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h, on Day 2 of q8
   dosing
 consider taper to q12h tomorrow
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider starting epogen with HD
   - Consider heme/onc consult for etiology of heme abnormalities
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP 100cc/day
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q24 per pharmacy
   - F/U daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Hyponatremia
to 132 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - DC vanco
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h, attempt lactulose PR today
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out yesterday and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, place NGT and consider
   starting TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy

   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, - family is aware of HepC and HIV
   although they do not like to openly discuss this
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: ICU pending hemodialysis

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Noticed yesterday afternoon that the patient
   was not verbal and not responding well to command.  Diff dx includes
   encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of negative CT), delirium,
   ileus.  Head CT was negative.  Infection also a possibility. Blinks to
   threat.  No obvious seizure activity
   - Lactulose to decrease ammonia
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt
s overall respiratory
   function markedly improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on
   RA, hemodynamically stable.  CVVH was continued until 5am this am due
   to clot.
   - Starting HD this morning with ultrafiltration per renal
   - Continue Vancomycin/Meropenem for PNA coverage
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors,
   tolerating CVVH well
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids to 50 mg IV q8h, on Day 2 of q8
   dosing
 consider taper to q12h tomorrow
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider starting epogen with HD
   - Consider heme/onc consult for etiology of heme abnormalities
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP 100cc/day
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q24 per pharmacy
   - F/U daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - continue sevelemer
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Hyponatremia
to 132 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - DC vanco
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h, attempt lactulose PR today
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out yesterday and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, place NGT and consider
   starting TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient presented with acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, but has now been extubated and is breathing comfortably on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is not verbal and is not responding well to commands, which could be due to encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), delirium, or infection. A head CT was negative, ruling out ICH. Infection is still a possibility. Lactulose has been prescribed to decrease ammonia levels.

2. Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: The patient's respiratory function has improved, but there is still a risk of respiratory distress if fluid overload occurs again. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) was continued until 5 am due to clot formation.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but close monitoring is required. Pressors may be needed if the blood pressure drops below the desired range.

4. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which could be concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation"

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV, well controlled; HCV, poorly controlled; ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease), portal hypertension, and a previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for hydrothorax. She was admitted with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute renal failure (ARF)/hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and subsequent hypotension. The patient's condition includes delirium/confusion, hyperkalemia (high potassium), hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), and hepatic encephalopathy.

Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing confusion and delirium, which may be due to hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Hyperkalemia (High Potassium): The patient has high levels of potassium in her blood, which can be dangerous and may require medical intervention to lower it.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has developed hepatorenal syndrome, a condition characterized by kidney failure in patients with advanced liver disease.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, a condition where there is an imbalance of acids and bicarbonate in the body.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis. She presented to the hospital for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. She is currently in the ICU, where she has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been displaying poor mental status, with nonsensical speech and subtle left-sided lip droop. This could be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy or delirium, which are common complications in patients with liver cirrhosis.

2. Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation but has since been extubated and is breathing comfortably on room air. However, she had fluid overload, which can lead to respiratory distress if not managed properly.

3. Hypotension: The patient was previously hypotensive and required pressors to maintain stable blood pressure. Now that she is off pressors, it is important to continue monitoring her blood pressure and ensuring adequate perfusion.

4. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has shown signs of anemia and thrombocytopenia, which could be related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other causes. Close monitoring of blood counts and appropriate interventions, such as blood transf"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for management of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) and Hepatic Reservoir Syndrome (HRS). She presented with acute respiratory decompensation in the setting of fluid overload. The patient has been improving, with her overall respiratory function markedly improved and now extubated and breathing comfortably on room air. She is hemodynamically stable and continues to show improvement in her mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient initially presented with poor mental status but has shown improvement. It is important to closely monitor her mental status and continue lactulose to decrease ammonia levels. Infection, hepatic encephalopathy, ileus, and delirium are potential differential diagnoses.
2. Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: The patient's respiratory function has improved significantly. However, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory distress due to fluid overload. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management of fluid balance are necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is resolving, and she is off pressors, tolerating continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) well. MAP goal should be maintained above 55, and stress dose steroids should be tapered per guidelines.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Noticed yesterday afternoon that the patient
   was not verbal and not responding well to command.  Diff dx includes
   encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of negative CT), delirium,
   ileus.  Head CT was negative.  Infection also a possibility. Blinks to
   threat.  No obvious seizure activity
   - Lactulose to decrease ammonia
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   - Deferring LP for now in setting of bleeding risk
   - Will continue lactulose and consider MRI in AM if MS not improved
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt
s overall respiratory
   function markedly improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on
   RA, hemodynamically stable.  CVVH was continued until 5am this am due
   to clot.
   - Continuing HD per renal recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors,
   tolerating CVVH well
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids to 50 mg q12h
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - epogen with HD
   - Consider heme/onc consult for etiology of heme abnormalities
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Unclear when patient stopped making urine. She is on
   octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP 100cc/day
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q24 per pharmacy
   - F/U daily vancomycin troughs
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   - consider sodium bicarb replacement for metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Hyponatremia
to 132 this AM.
   - Dilute antibiotics in NS rather than D5.
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage.  Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - Increase lactulose to 30mg q4h,
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   - check hemolysis labs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today and will be undergoing HD line placement.
   - vit k daily
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if possible
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: likely all fluid overload
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: continuing her on stress steroids
    - continue stress dose steroids for 7 day course
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out yesterday and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, place NGT and consider
   starting TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: PICC Line - [**2200-4-4**] 02:00 PM

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who was admitted for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She presented with acute respiratory distress due to fluid overload. The patient is currently extubated and breathing comfortably on room air, with stable vital signs. She has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, and is receiving lactulose for treatment. 

The patient also has hypotension that has resolved, anemia and thrombocytopenia possibly related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure secondary to HRS, hyponatremia, SBP, complicated Hepatitis C cirrhosis with ascites, coagulopathy, and hypothyroidism. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is undergoing hemodialysis. 

The patient's HIV status is stable, and her CD4 count is high without evidence of AIDS. She is currently on HAART medications. Her social situation involves her son as the healthcare power of attorney, with her daughter-in-law and boyfriend as secondary contacts. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could progress to more severe hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to increased confusion, disorientation, and even coma.
2. Infection:"

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV (well controlled), HCV (poorly controlled), ESLD, portal hypertension, and a previous TIPS procedure for hydrothorax. She was admitted with SBP and ARF/HRS and experienced subsequent hypotension. The patient has a known history of GIB and is currently experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, and delirium.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.4°C (95.7°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/62 mmHg to 152/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented but still confused.

The patient has been receiving multiple treatments and medications, including antibiotics for ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae in her urine, HAART for HIV, vancomycin for SBP, and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency. The patient also has a PICC line and a dialysis catheter in place.

The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels (7.6 g/dL), low albumin levels (2.5 g/dL), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 16/44), and abnormal kidney function (creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL). The patient's blood count reveals"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status: Improving this morning. [**4-9**] the patient had
   altered mental status and became nonverbal.  Diff dx includes hepatic
   encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of negative CT), delirium,
   ileus.  Head CT was negative.  No obvious seizure activity.  Patient
   was continued on lactulose and menatal status has steadily improved
   with increased bowel movements.
   - Continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - On rifaximin
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt
s overall respiratory
   function markedly improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on
   2L NC, hemodynamically stable.  CVVH removed about 16 liters and the
   patient was then transitioned to HD.
   - Continuing HD per renal recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   #Hypotension: Resolved. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors.
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids 50 mg q12h and plan to taper tomorrow
   per guideline:
   Dosing schedule
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10
   mg/h continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of
   treatment for 10 to 14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and
   ventilator
free
 before taper
   Hydrocortisone taper
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 8 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po every 12 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po daily for 3 to 4 d
   Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   - Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again.  No obvious source of bleeding. Platelets are
   improving somewhat.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - PM CBC, will re-visit transfusion on repeat CBC given lower Hct
   today.
   - epogen with HD
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP
   100cc/day, although somewhat improved over the last 48 hours.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q24 per pharmacy
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage. Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - Meropenem for ESBP UTI as well x 10days (On day 6 of 10)
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if needed
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hyponatremia
resolved
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: Initial respiratory distress likely due to fluid overload as
   opposed to COPD flare.  Has now been stable.
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper as outlined above
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out and in chart and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presented with symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory distress in the setting of fluid overload. Her mental status improved after being treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. She was extubated and breathing comfortably on a low flow nasal cannula. Her hypotension resolved, and she is now hemodynamically stable. She has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but no obvious source of bleeding. She is being treated for SBP and HRS with octreotide and midodrine. Her renal function is oliguric, likely due to HRS. She has a history of SBP from outside hospital and was previously treated with ciprofloxacin. She has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites, coagulopathy, and a recent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. She is being started on rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. Her coagulopathy is managed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion. She has stable HIV with a high CD4 count. Her hyponatremia and hypothyroidism are resolved. She had initial respiratory distress likely due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status: Improving this morning. [**4-9**] the patient had
   altered mental status and became nonverbal.  Diff dx includes hepatic
   encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of negative CT), delirium,
   ileus.  Head CT was negative.  No obvious seizure activity.  Patient
   was continued on lactulose and menatal status has steadily improved
   with increased bowel movements.
   - Continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt
s overall respiratory
   function markedly improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on
   2L NC, hemodynamically stable.  CVVH removed about 16 liters and the
   patient was then transitioned to HD.
   - Continuing HD per renal recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors.
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids 50 mg q12h and plan to taper tomorrow
   per guideline:
   Dosing schedule
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10
   mg/h continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of
   treatment for 10 to 14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and
   ventilator
free
 before taper
   Hydrocortisone taper
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 8 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po every 12 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po daily for 3 to 4 d
   Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   - Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again.  No obvious source of bleeding. Platelets are
   improving somewhat.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - epogen with HD
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP
   100cc/day, although somewhat improved over the last 48 hours.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q24 per pharmacy
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage. Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if needed
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hyponatremia
resolved
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: Initial respiratory distress likely due to fluid overload as
   opposed to COPD flare.  Has now been stable.
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper as outlined above
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out and in chart and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, consider PO challenge
   today with removal of NGT if able to swallow
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: PICC Line - [**2200-4-4**] 02:00 PM
   Dialysis Catheter - [**2200-4-4**] 05:30 PM
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, - family is aware of HepC and HIV
   although they do not like to openly discuss this
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: likely callout tomorrow morning assuming mental status
   continues to improve.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She also has a background of COPD, COPD exacerbation, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, respiratory distress due to fluid overload, hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. She is currently receiving treatment for SBP with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, hepatorenal syndrome with octreotide and midodrine, and hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose. The patient is also being closely monitored for potential complications such as sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, and renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory distress due to fluid overload or worsening COPD, persistent hypotension, worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia, progression of acute renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these conditions will be necessary to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for various medical complications. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications, including sulfonamides, penicillins, and aldactone, which can cause angioedema, hives, and blisters.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/66 mmHg to 143/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including pantoprazole and other ICU medications.

The patient's weight has decreased from 120 kg at admission to 91.5 kg, indicating significant weight loss. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,000 mL (290 mL PO, 720 mL TF, 120 mL IVF) and an output of 3,400 mL (1,010 mL urine, 900 mL NG, 250 mL drains), resulting in a negative balance of 2,400 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG showing pH of 7.29. Physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and certain laboratory values.

Laboratory results indicate elevated potassium levels (K+ of "

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status: Improving this morning. [**4-9**] the patient had
   altered mental status and became nonverbal.  Diff dx includes hepatic
   encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of negative CT), delirium,
   ileus.  Head CT was negative.  No obvious seizure activity.  Patient
   was continued on lactulose and menatal status has steadily improved
   with increased bowel movements.
   - Continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - On rifaximin
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt
s overall respiratory
   function markedly improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on
   2L NC, hemodynamically stable.  CVVH removed about 16 liters and the
   patient was then transitioned to HD.
   - Continuing HD per renal recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   #Hypotension: Resolved. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors.
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids 50 mg q12h and plan to taper tomorrow
   per guideline:
   Dosing schedule
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10
   mg/h continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of
   treatment for 10 to 14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and
   ventilator
free
 before taper
   Hydrocortisone taper
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 8 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po every 12 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po daily for 3 to 4 d
   Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   - Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again.  No obvious source of bleeding. Platelets are
   improving somewhat.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - PM CBC, will re-visit transfusion on repeat CBC given lower Hct
   today.
   - epogen with HD
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP
   100cc/day, although somewhat improved over the last 48 hours.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q24 per pharmacy
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage. Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - Meropenem for ESBP UTI as well x 10days (On day 6 of 10)
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if needed
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hyponatremia
resolved
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: Initial respiratory distress likely due to fluid overload as
   opposed to COPD flare.  Has now been stable.
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper as outlined above
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out and in chart and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, continue on tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots,
   - SQ heparin today given platelets up-trending
   # Access: PICC Line - [**2200-4-4**] 02:00 PM
   Dialysis Catheter - [**2200-4-4**] 05:30 PM
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, - family is aware of HepC and HIV
   although they do not like to openly discuss this
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: likely callout today assuming mental status continues to
   improve.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis. The patient presented with management of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) and Hepatic Residual Syndrome (HRS), along with acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload.

The patient's mental status has been improving steadily since the administration of lactulose and removal of 16 liters through continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). She is now extubated and breathing comfortably on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is maintaining stable blood pressures in the 100s-120s range, off pressors. Stress dose steroids were given, and the plan is to taper tomorrow as per guidelines.

Possible complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient initially had altered mental status and became nonverbal, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition is improving with increased bowel movements after starting lactulose.

2. Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: The patient initially experienced respiratory distress due to fluid overload. Although her overall respiratory function has improved, monitoring for any signs of recurrent respiratory distress or fluid overload is necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient previously had refractory hypotension but has now stabilized. Continued monitoring of blood pressure is required, and the stress dose"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status: Improving this morning. [**4-9**] the patient had
   altered mental status and became nonverbal.  Diff dx includes hepatic
   encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of negative CT), delirium,
   ileus.  Head CT was negative.  No obvious seizure activity.  Patient
   was continued on lactulose and menatal status has steadily improved
   with increased bowel movements.
   - Continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt
s overall respiratory
   function markedly improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on
   2L NC, hemodynamically stable.  CVVH removed about 16 liters and the
   patient was then transitioned to HD.
   - Continuing HD per renal recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   #Hypotension: Resolving. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors.
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids 50 mg q12h and plan to taper tomorrow
   per guideline:
   Dosing schedule
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10
   mg/h continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of
   treatment for 10 to 14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and
   ventilator
free
 before taper
   Hydrocortisone taper
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 8 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po every 12 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po daily for 3 to 4 d
   Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   - Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again.  No obvious source of bleeding. Platelets are
   improving somewhat.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - CBC [**Hospital1 **]
   - epogen with HD
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP
   100cc/day, although somewhat improved over the last 48 hours.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q24 per pharmacy
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage. Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if needed
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hyponatremia
resolved
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: Initial respiratory distress likely due to fluid overload as
   opposed to COPD flare.  Has now been stable.
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper as outlined above
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out and in chart and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, consider PO challenge
   today with removal of NGT if able to swallow
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no SQ hep in setting of coagulopathy
   # Access: PICC Line - [**2200-4-4**] 02:00 PM
   Dialysis Catheter - [**2200-4-4**] 05:30 PM
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, - family is aware of HepC and HIV
   although they do not like to openly discuss this
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: likely callout tomorrow morning assuming mental status
   continues to improve.
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory decompensation in the setting of fluid overload. The patient had altered mental status but has improved with increased bowel movements. She is now extubated and breathing comfortably on 2L NC.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient initially had altered mental status and became nonverbal. Diffuse diagnostic possibilities include hepatic encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), delirium, and ileus. A head CT was negative, and there was no obvious seizure activity. The patient was continued on lactulose, and mental status has steadily improved with increased bowel movements.

2. Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: The patient's overall respiratory function has markedly improved. She is now off the ventilator and breathing comfortably on 2L NC. Hemodynamic stability is maintained. CVVH removed about 16 liters, and the patient was transitioned to HD.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is resolving, with SBPs in the 100s-120s, off pressors. The goal MAP is >55. Stress dose steroids 50 mg q12h are being given and will be tapered tomorrow per guideline. Hydrocortis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV (well controlled), HCV (poorly controlled), ESLD, portal hypertension, and a previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for hydrothorax. The patient also has a past medical history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), sepsis and acute renal failure/ hepatorenal syndrome (SBP and ARF/HRS), and has been admitted multiple times.

The patient is currently in the ICU with the following conditions:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient continues to be confused but verbal. Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of liver disease, characterized by cognitive dysfunction and altered mental status.
2. Renal failure: The patient is on dialysis and producing some urine on her own. Acute renal failure can be a result of various factors, including severe liver disease (hepatorenal syndrome).
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient is delirious and not following simple commands. Delirium is a serious condition characterized by confusion, disorientation, and changes in consciousness.
4. Hyperkalemia (high potassium): The patient has an elevated potassium level, which can be life-threatening and requires prompt medical intervention.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: This syndrome occurs when severe liver disease leads to kidney failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV, HCV, ESLD, portal hypertension, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been admitted multiple times for SBP and ARF/HRS. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, and other complications. Her current medications include lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, HD for renal failure, midodrine and octreotide, HAART, vancomycin for SBP, and hydrocortisone taper for adrenal insufficiency. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 150/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. She has a sinus bradycardia rhythm. 

The patient is confused but verbal and unable to provide her own history. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Her blood glucose level is elevated at 167 mg/dL. 

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct and Plt, elevated Cr, TCO2, and LDH, along with abnormal electrolyte levels including high potassium and low sodium. Liver enzymes are within normal range. 

The patient's abdominal examination reveals a non-tender, distended abdomen. She has"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Continues to be an ongoing problem, with
   worsening mental status yesterday, despite ongoing optimal lactulose.
   Head CT continues to be negative. No obvious seizure activity.
    - will let wake up from propofol and extubate and evaluate post
   extubation mental status
    - if continues to be altered will pursue further neuro workup: LP, +/-
   MRI, +/- Neuro consult
    - if LP likely will require coag optimization
    - check thiamine and folate
    - continue lactulose 30q6hr
    - continue rifaximin
   # Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: Pt intubated following
   apenic episode. Tolerating vent well, good RSBI. Unclear what caused
   underlying apneic episode yesterday.
   - wean off vent today
   - extubate later this AM
   - continue abx for PNA
   #Hypotension: Resolved. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors.
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids 50 mg q12h and plan to taper tomorrow
   per guideline below
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP
   100cc/day, although somewhat improved over the last 48 hours. HD
   Saturday, now with flat creatinine.
   - holding off on HD today
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - change meropenem to 1g q12 per pharmacy
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again. No obvious source of bleeding. Platelets are
   improving somewhat.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - epogen with HD
   - check PM CBC
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage. Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - Meropenem for ESBP UTI as well x 10days (On day 6 of 10)
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if needed
   # Hypernatremia
   - add free water flushes to tube feeds, 50 q6
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: Initial respiratory distress likely due to fluid overload as
   opposed to COPD flare.  Has now been stable.
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper.
   Dosing:
   -Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10 mg/h
   continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of treatment for 10 to
   14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and ventilator
free
 before
   taper.
   -Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   -Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])
   Hydrocortisone Taper
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 8 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po every 12 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po daily for 3 to 4 d
   Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out and in chart and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, continue on tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots,
   - SQ heparin today given platelets up-trending
   # Access: PICC Line - [**2200-4-4**] 02:00 PM

   trialed on BiPap and the decision was then made to intubate.  RSI was
   done with propofol and etomidate.  A-line was placed.  Repeat CT of the
   head was done showing:
   1. No evidence of hemorrhage. If persistent concern for subtle acute
   intracranial abnormality, MRI would be more sensitive for evaluation if
   clinically indicated.
   2. Stable opacification of right maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening
   of the left sphenoid sinus. Recommend correlation for sinusitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Worsening mental status yesterday. [**4-9**] the
   patient had altered mental status and became nonverbal.  Diff dx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of
   negative CT), delirium, ileus.  Head CT was negative X3.  No obvious
   seizure activity.  Patient was continued on lactulose and menatal
   status has steadily improved with increased bowel movements.
   - Continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - On rifaximin
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   -  ? MRI
   - ? LP
   - ? Neuro consult
   .
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt intubated following apenic
   episode. Tolerating vent well.
   - Wean off vent today
   - extubate later this AM
   .
   #Hypotension: Resolved. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors.
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids 50 mg q12h and plan to taper tomorrow
   per guideline:
   Dosing schedule
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10
   mg/h continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of
   treatment for 10 to 14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and
   ventilator
free
 before taper
   Hydrocortisone taper
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 8 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po every 12 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po daily for 3 to 4 d
   Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   - Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again.  No obvious source of bleeding. Platelets are
   improving somewhat.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - epogen with HD
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP
   100cc/day, although somewhat improved over the last 48 hours.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q12 per pharmacy
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage. Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - Meropenem for ESBP UTI as well x 10days (On day 6 of 10)
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue SBP treatment as outlined above
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - follow up liver US with Doppler
 no ascites
   - trend LFTs
   # Coagulopathy: again in the setting of chronic liver disease; INR 1.8
   today
   - transfuse two units FFP pre-procedure if needed
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypernatremia
   - increase free water flushes
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # COPD: Initial respiratory distress likely due to fluid overload as
   opposed to COPD flare.  Has now been stable.
   - consider nebulizers as needed
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper as outlined above
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out and in chart and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes per renal, continue on tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots,
   - SQ heparin today given platelets up-trending
   # Access: PICC Line - [**2200-4-4**] 02:00 PM
   Dialysis Catheter - [**2200-4-4**] 05:30 PM
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, - family is aware of HepC and HIV
   although they do not like to openly discuss this
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: likely callout today assuming mental status continues to
   improve.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Continues to be an ongoing problem, with
   worsening mental status yesterday, despite ongoing optimal lactulose.
   Head CT continues to be negative. No obvious seizure activity.
    - will let wake up from propofol and extubate and evaluate post
   extubation mental status
    - if continues to be altered will pursue further neuro workup: LP, +/-
   MRI, +/- Neuro consult
    - if LP likely will require coag optimization
    - check thiamine and folate
    - continue lactulose 30q6hr
    - continue rifaximin
   # Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: Pt intubated following
   apenic episode. Tolerating vent well, good RSBI. Unclear what caused
   underlying apneic episode yesterday.
   - wean off vent today
   - extubate later this AM
   - continue abx for PNA
   #Hypotension: Resolved. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors.
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids 50 mg q12h and plan to taper tomorrow
   per guideline:
   Dosing schedule
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10
   mg/h continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of
   treatment for 10 to 14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and
   ventilator
free
 before taper

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who was admitted for the management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She presented with acute respiratory decompensation in the setting of fluid overload. The patient's mental status has been worsening, despite optimal lactulose treatment, and further neuro workup is planned if she remains altered after extubation. She was intubated following an apneic episode but is now tolerating ventilation well. The underlying cause of the apneic episode is unclear.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to have an altered mental status, which is a concern. A head CT has been performed, showing no evidence of hemorrhage. If her mental status remains altered after extubation, further neuro workup, including lumbar puncture (LP) and possibly an MRI, may be pursued.
2. Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: The patient experienced an apneic episode, leading to intubation. She is currently tolerating ventilation well, with a good respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). Plans are in place to wean her off the ventilator today and consider extubation later this morning.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, with maintaining systolic blood pressures (SBPs) in the 100s-"

   Pt. with worsening mental status and period of apnea, taking slow
   shallow breaths.  ABGs showed acidemia with hypercarcbia.  Pt. was
   trialed on BiPap and the decision was then made to intubate.  RSI was
   done with propofol and etomidate.  A-line was placed.  Repeat CT of the
   head was done showing:
   1. No evidence of hemorrhage. If persistent concern for subtle acute
   intracranial abnormality, MRI would be more sensitive for evaluation if
   clinically indicated.
   2. Stable opacification of right maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening
   of the left sphenoid sinus. Recommend correlation for sinusitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status: Improving this morning. [**4-9**] the patient had
   altered mental status and became nonverbal.  Diff dx includes hepatic
   encephalopathy, ICH (less likely in setting of negative CT), delirium,
   ileus.  Head CT was negative.  No obvious seizure activity.  Patient
   was continued on lactulose and menatal status has steadily improved
   with increased bowel movements.
   - Continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - On rifaximin
   - Check blood/urine cx
   - Closely follow mental status
   # Respiratory Distress/Volume Overload: Pt
s overall respiratory
   function markedly improved. Now extubated and breathing comfortably on
   2L NC, hemodynamically stable.  CVVH removed about 16 liters and the
   patient was then transitioned to HD.
   - Continuing HD per renal recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   #Hypotension: Resolved. Maintaining SBPs in 100s-120s, off pressors.
   - MAP goal >55
   - Continuing stress dose steroids 50 mg q12h and plan to taper tomorrow
   per guideline:
   Dosing schedule
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10
   mg/h continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of
   treatment for 10 to 14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and
   ventilator
free
 before taper
   Hydrocortisone taper
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 8 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po every 12 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po daily for 3 to 4 d
   Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   - Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Possible DIC: initially with anemia and
   thrombocytopenia concerning for DIC, fibrinogen had increased, however
   now decreased again.  No obvious source of bleeding. Platelets are
   improving somewhat.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - PM CBC, will re-visit transfusion on repeat CBC given lower Hct
   today.
   - epogen with HD
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Electrolytes stable.  UOP
   100cc/day, although somewhat improved over the last 48 hours.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications
   - Change meropenem to 1g q24 per pharmacy
   - HD line in place for potential CVVH vs. HD for volume removal
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Vanco added last night for broader coverage. Culture
   data from OSH negative.
   - Meropenem for ESBP UTI as well x 10days (On day 6 of 10)
   - continue current abx (ciprofloxacin, per ID recs).
   - albumin daily once respiratory status stabilized

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload and required intubation. She was diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, which improved with lactulose treatment. The patient's respiratory function has markedly improved, and she was successfully extubated. Her hypotension resolved, and she is now hemodynamically stable. There are concerns about possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but fibrinogen levels have fluctuated. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be related to HRS. She is on octreotide and midodrine for renal support. The patient also has a history of SBP, COPD, adrenal insufficiency, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, and HIV infection. She underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient's current medications include lactulose, rifaximin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, epogen, stress steroids, and HAART.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of HIV (well controlled), HCV (poorly controlled), ESLD (end-stage liver disease), portal hypertension, and previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement for hydrothorax. 

The patient presented to the hospital with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and acute renal failure/hepatorenal syndrome (ARF/HRS), for which they were admitted. Since admission, the patient has been hemodynamically stable, tolerating dialysis, but experiencing ongoing hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient had an apneic episode of unclear etiology yesterday and required intubation. Currently, the patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 42, indicating the ability to sustain spontaneous breathing. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, liver enzymes, and lactate, along with decreased albumin and platelet count. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) indicates metabolic acidosis. 

Assessment and plan include altered mental status (not delirium), hyperkalemia, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and acute renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening"

   URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):
      YEAST.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   Blood cultures--Pending
   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Improving. Continues to be an ongoing
   problem, with worsening mental status yesterday, despite ongoing
   optimal lactulose. All head imaging to date negative. No obvious
   seizure activity. Likely hepatic encephalopathy with renal failure.
   - continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - continue rifaximin
   - Giving thiamine and folate
   - Can hold off on further work-up for now given improving mental status
   (no need for LP or neuro consult)
   # Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: Post extubation, no more
   apneic episodes
   - Continue to monitor for further apneic events
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Creatinine is downtrending and she is increasing her urine
   output. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Creatinine down-trending.
   - renal continuing to hold off on HD for now given improvement.
   - f/u with liver/renal about continuing v. DC
ing octreotide and
   midodrine
   - f/u final renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications and antibiotics
   # Hypernatremia
Na 150, up from 146. Likely due to relative
   dehydration. [**Name2 (NI) **] water deficit around 3.5
   - Increase free water flushes (currently 50q6; change to 250q4)
   - Give D5W @ 100cc/hr x 2L
   - F/u PM lytes
   # Hypertension
unclear reason for hypertension, but since midnight BPs
   in 130s-170s.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - restart  home dose of amlodipine 10mg qday
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Multiple etiologies likely,
   including HIV, Hep C, previous concern of DIC. No obvious source of
   bleeding. Platelets are improving.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - check PM CBC, liver recommends hemolysis labs
   # ESBL UTI
   - On meropenem x10 days. Today is day 9 of 10 (started on [**2200-4-7**])
   - Change Foley as urine culture grew yeast
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Resolved. Culture data from OSH negative. S/p course of
   ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.
   - Continue daily abdominal exams. Current exam stable.
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper.
   Dosing:
   -Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10 mg/h
   continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of treatment for 10 to
   14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and ventilator
free
 before
   taper.
   -Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   -Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])
   Hydrocortisone Taper
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 8 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po every 12 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po daily for 3 to 4 d
   Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   - Now on 50 mg qday
 day 2 of this dose, will DC on [**4-16**]
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - trend LFTs; currently stable
   - Continue to monitor INR in the setting of coagulopathy from chronic
   liver disease. Currently stable at 1.6
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper.
   Dosing:
   -Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10 mg/h

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis. She presents to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. 

The patient's mental status is improving but remains delirious. She has a history of SBP from an outside hospital and was being treated with ciprofloxacin. The abdominal exam is currently stable. 

The patient's renal function is improving, as indicated by a down-trending creatinine level and increased urine output. She is on octreotide and midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome. 

The patient has hypernatremia, possibly due to relative dehydration. She is receiving free water flushes and D5W to correct this. 

The patient's hypertension is unclear, but her blood pressure has been in the 130s-170s since midnight. She is restarting her home dose of amlodipine. 

The patient has stable anemia and thrombocytopenia, with multiple potential etiologies including HIV, Hep C, and previous concern of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient had an ESBL UTI, which was treated with meropenem. Her Foley catheter grew yeast, so it was changed. 

The patient has a history of SBP and was treated with c"

   Blood cultures--Pending
   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Improving. Continues to be an ongoing
   problem, with worsening mental status yesterday, despite ongoing
   optimal lactulose. All head imaging to date negative. No obvious
   seizure activity. Likely hepatic encephalopathy with renal failure.
   - continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - continue rifaximin
   - Giving thiamine and folate
   - Can hold off on further work-up for now given improving mental status
   (no need for LP or neuro consult)
   # Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: Post extubation, no more
   apneic episodes
   - Continue to monitor for further apneic events
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Creatinine is downtrending and she is increasing her urine
   output. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Creatinine down-trending.
   - renal continuing to hold off on HD for now given improvement.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u final renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications and antibiotics
   # Hypernatremia
Na 150, up from 146. Likely due to relative
   dehydration. [**Name2 (NI) **] water deficit around 3.5
   - Increase free water flushes (currently 50q6; change to 250q4)
   - Give D5W @ 100cc/hr x 2L
   - F/u PM lytes
   # Hypertension
unclear reason for hypertension, but since midnight BPs
   in 130s.
   - Continue to monitor BPs, hold off on treating with anti-hypertensives
   for now unless persistent elevations in BP
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Multiple etiologies likely,
   including HIV, Hep C, previous concern of DIC. No obvious source of
   bleeding. Platelets are improving.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - check PM CBC
   # ESBL UTI
   - On meropenem x10 days. Today is day 9 of 10 (started on [**2200-4-7**])
   - Change Foley as urine culture grew yeast
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Resolved. Culture data from OSH negative. S/p course of
   ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - trend LFTs; currently stable
   - Continue to monitor INR in the setting of coagulopathy from chronic
   liver disease. Currently stable at 1.6
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper.
   Dosing:
   -Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10 mg/h
   continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of treatment for 10 to
   14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and ventilator
free
 before
   taper.
   -Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   -Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])
   Hydrocortisone Taper
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 8 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po every 12 h for 3 to 4 d
   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV/po daily for 3 to 4 d
   Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who is currently admitted to the ICU for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She presented with acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is delirious but interactive. There is a suspicion of hepatic encephalopathy with renal failure, and lactulose and rifaximin have been prescribed to manage this condition.

2. Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: The patient had respiratory distress and apnea, but post-extubation, there are no more apneic episodes. Close monitoring for further respiratory events is recommended.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is likely experiencing oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal syndrome. She is being treated with octreotide and midodrine, and her creatinine levels are trending down. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is being held off for now due to improvement, but will be continued if necessary.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 150, which is likely due to relative dehydration. Measures are being taken to increase free water flushes and administer D5W to correct this condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Improving. Continues to be an ongoing
   problem, with worsening mental status yesterday, despite ongoing
   optimal lactulose. All head imaging to date negative. No obvious
   seizure activity. Likely hepatic encephalopathy with renal failure.
   - continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - continue rifaximin
   - Giving thiamine and folate
   - Can hold off on further work-up for now given improving mental status
   (no need for LP or neuro consult)
   # Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: Post extubation, no more
   apneic episodes
   - Continue to monitor for further apneic events
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Creatinine is downtrending and she is increasing her urine
   output. She is on octreotide and midodrine. Creatinine down-trending.
   - renal continuing to hold off on HD for now given improvement.
   - continue octreotide and midodrine
   - f/u final renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications and antibiotics
   # Hypernatremia
Na 150, up from 146. Likely due to relative
   dehydration. [**Name2 (NI) **] water deficit around 3.5
   - Increase free water flushes (currently 50q6; change to 250q4)
   - Give D5W @ 100cc/hr x 2L
   - F/u PM lytes
   # Hypertension
unclear reason for hypertension, but since midnight BPs
   in 130s.
   - Continue to monitor BPs, hold off on treating with anti-hypertensives
   for now unless persistent elevations in BP
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Multiple etiologies likely,
   including HIV, Hep C, previous concern of DIC. No obvious source of
   bleeding. Platelets are improving.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - check PM CBC
   # ESBL UTI
   - On meropenem x10 days. Today is day 9 of 10 (started on [**2200-4-7**])
   - Change Foley as urine culture grew yeast
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Resolved. Culture data from OSH negative. S/p course of
   ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.
   - Continue daily abdominal exams. Current exam stable.
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - trend LFTs; currently stable
   - Continue to monitor INR in the setting of coagulopathy from chronic
   liver disease. Currently stable at 1.6
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper.
   Dosing:
   -Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 h or 100-mg bolus then 10 mg/h
   continuous infusion for at least 7 d with option of treatment for 10 to
   14 d. Patients should be vasopressor and ventilator
free
 before
   taper.
   -Reinstitution of full-dose hydrocortisone with recurrence of
   hemodynamic instability
   -Therefore will give 50mg qday x 4 days (finish on [**4-16**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She has experienced acute respiratory decompensation in the setting of fluid overload and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/79 to 175/129 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is alert and awake, with some inappropriate statements. Physical examination reveals a III/VI systolic murmur, clear lung sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and warm and well-perfused extremities.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, low total bilirubin, and normal electrolyte levels. The urine culture revealed the presence of yeast. The patient is on multiple medications including lactulose, rifaximin, thiamine, folate, octreotide, midodrine, meropenem, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of liver cirrhosis and altered mental status, hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication.
2. Renal failure:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving multiple treatments and interventions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, likely exacerbated by renal failure. Lactulose and rifaximin are being used to manage this condition.
2. Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: The patient had respiratory distress and apnea episodes, but these have improved post-extubation. Continuous monitoring for further respiratory events is recommended.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has oliguric renal failure secondary to HRS. Octreotide and midodrine are being given to manage this condition. Renal function is being closely monitored, and hemodialysis (HD) may be considered if necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to relative dehydration. Fluid management with free water flushes and D5W infusion is being implemented.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high, but it is unclear why. Blood pressure monitoring will continue, and anti-hypertensive treatment"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV (well controlled), HCV (poorly controlled), cirrhosis, and renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications including hepatic encephalopathy, acute respiratory failure, septic shock, and hepato-renal syndrome. The patient's current condition is improving, with significant improvement in mental status and tolerance of dialysis.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a condition characterized by altered mental status due to liver dysfunction. The patient is already experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, but it is improving with lactulose and rifaximin therapy.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure and is currently on dialysis. There is evidence of renal recovery, and fluid repletion is being done for hypernatremia. Holding off on further dialysis for now.
3. Infection: The patient is on meropenem for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella infection in the urine. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is being tapered off hydrocortisone, which indicates improvement in adrenal function.

   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status: Improving. All head imaging to date negative.
   No obvious seizure activity. Likely hepatic encephalopathy with renal
   failure.
   - continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - continue rifaximin
   - giving thiamine and folate
   - hold off on further work-up for now given significantly improved
   mental status (no need for LP or neuro consult)
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Creatinine is downtrending and she is increasing her urine
   output.
   - renal continuing to hold off on HD for now given improvement.
   - Renal will pull HD catheter today
   - f/u final renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications and antibiotics
   - Currently off octeotride and midodrine
   # Hypernatremia
147 today, down from 150 after getting 2L D5Q and
   increased free water flushes. Likely due to relative dehydration. [**Name2 (NI) **]
   water deficit ~2.3.
   - As we advance her diet she will likely self-correct.
   - Give D5W @ 100cc/hr x 1L
   - F/u PM lytes
   # Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: Post extubation, no more
   apneic episodes
   - Continue to monitor for further apneic events
   - F/u final read of yesterday
s CXR
?aspiration, but now seems less
   likely
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Multiple etiologies likely,
   including HIV, Hep C, previous concern of DIC. No obvious source of
   bleeding. Platelets are improving. Hemolysis labs positive for ongoing
   hemolysis (increased LDH, decreased fibrinogen, increased total and
   indirect bilirubin, increased LDH). But these have been abnormal in
   past, and some of these markers may be explained by cirrhosis.
   - Check reticulocyte count.
   - F/u peripheral smear
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   - given INR will give FFP prior to pulling line
   # ESBL UTI
Foley changed yesterday
   - On meropenem x10 days. Today is day 10 of 10 (started on [**2200-4-7**])
   - d/c meropenem and start cipro prophylaxis tomorrow
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Resolved. Culture data from OSH negative. S/p course of
   ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.
   - Continue daily abdominal exams. Current exam stable.
   # Hypertension
SBP in 130s and 140s mainly
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - No need to restart home amlodipine today unless becomes significantly
   more hypertensive.
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper.
   Dosing:
   - d/c steroids today, s/p steroid taper.
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - trend LFTs; currently stable
   - Continue to monitor INR in the setting of coagulopathy from chronic
   liver disease. Currently stable at 1.6
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out and in chart and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt
s boyfriend will be secondary contacts in
   the event that her son needs to return to [**Country 8643**]
   - Family is aware of her HIV and Hep C status (they do not openly
   discuss it, however)
   # FEN: passed speech and swallow
   - D/c tube feeds
   - Advance diet as tolerated
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, hold SCH until after line
   # Access: PICC Line - [**2200-4-4**] 02:00 PM and dialysis catheter
   - Renal will pull out dialysis catheter today.
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, - family is aware of HepC and HIV
   although they do not like to openly discuss this
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: Call out today
","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents for management of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) and Hepatic Renal Syndrome (HRS). She also has acute respiratory decompensation in the setting of fluid overload. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 155/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Her weight is currently 85.5 kg, down from 120 kg on admission.

The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests and procedures, including an abdominal exam, head imaging, liver function tests, complete blood count, coagulation profile, blood cultures, urine culture, and arterial blood gas analysis. The results of these tests indicate several potential medical complications.

Firstly, the patient has altered mental status, which is improving. This could be due to hepatic encephalopathy with renal failure. The patient is being given lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.

Secondly, the patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.8%, and platelet count of 72,000/mm³. These findings may be attributed to multiple"

   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Improving. All head imaging to date negative.
   No obvious seizure activity. Likely hepatic encephalopathy with renal
   failure.
   - continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - continue rifaximin
   - Giving thiamine and folate
   - Can hold off on further work-up for now given significantly improved
   mental status (no need for LP or neuro consult)
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Creatinine is downtrending and she is increasing her urine
   output.
   - renal continuing to hold off on HD for now given improvement.
   - Renal will pull HD catheter today
   - f/u final renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications and antibiotics
   - Currently off octeotride and midodrine
   # Hypernatremia
147 today, down from 150 after getting 2L D5Q and
   increased free water flushes. Likely due to relative dehydration. [**Name2 (NI) **]
   water deficit ~2.3.
   - As we advance her diet she will likey self-correct.
   - Give D5W @ 100cc/hr x 1L
   - F/u PM lytes
   # Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: Post extubation, no more
   apneic episodes
   - Continue to monitor for further apneic events
   - F/u final read of AM CXR
   - F/u today
s CXR
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Multiple etiologies likely,
   including HIV, Hep C, previous concern of DIC. No obvious source of
   bleeding. Platelets are improving. Hemolysis labs positive for ongoing
   hemolysis (increased LDH, decreased fibrinogen, increased total and
   indirect bilirubin, increased LDH). But these have been abnormal in
   past, and some of these markers may be explained by cirrhosis.
   - Check reticulocyte count.
   - F/u peripheral smear
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   # ESBL UTI
Foley changed yesterday
   - On meropenem x10 days. Today is day 10 of 10 (started on [**2200-4-7**])
   - D/c meropenem tomorrow
   # SBP: has hx of SBP from outside hospital and was being treated with
   ciprofloxacin. Resolved. Culture data from OSH negative. S/p course of
   ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.
   - Continue daily abdominal exams. Current exam stable.
   # Hypertension
SBP in 130s and 140s mainly
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - No need to restart home amlodipine today unless becomes significantly
   more hypertensive.
   # Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt. had refractory hypotension and failed [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test during early admission.  Continuing her on stress steroids
   with taper.
   Dosing:
   - D/c steroids today, s/p steroid taper.
   # Hep C / Cirrhosis: has complicated Hep C cirrhosis with ascites and
   drain on R side of abdomen, s/p TIPS procedures and coagulopathy. Bili
   bumped today without other LFT changes.  Started on Rifaximin on [**4-12**].
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - trend LFTs; currently stable
   - Continue to monitor INR in the setting of coagulopathy from chronic
   liver disease. Currently stable at 1.6
   # HIV: stable, CD4 count high without evidence of AIDS.
   - Continue HIV meds (pt. now taking PO)
   - continue HAART meds, redose her meds per pharmacy
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH here 3.5, not probably accurate in setting of an
   accute illness.
   - continue home levothyroxine dose
   # Social situation
 social work is involved
   -Son in from [**Country 8643**]
   -He remains the HCP, new form filled out and in chart and the pt
   daughter-in-law and the pt

   # Access: PICC Line - [**2200-4-4**] 02:00 PM and dialysis catheter
   - Renal will pull out dialysis catheter today.
   # Communication: Patient; HCP is son, - family is aware of HepC and HIV
   although they do not like to openly discuss this
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient this morning while in respiratory
   distress).  Per report was confirmed last night as well.
   # Disposition: Call out today
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented for management of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) and Hepatic Renal Syndrome (HRS). She had acute respiratory decompensation due to fluid overload.

The patient's mental status has improved significantly, so further work-up for altered mental status, such as lumbar puncture or neuro consult, is being held off.

The patient likely has oliguric renal failure secondary to HRS. Renal replacement therapy is being withheld for now due to improvement in urine output. The patient will continue to be monitored for any signs of worsening renal function.

The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 147. This is thought to be due to relative dehydration. The water deficit is estimated to be around 2.3 liters. The patient will be given D5W at 100 cc/hr x 1L to correct the electrolyte imbalance.

After extubation, the patient no longer experienced apneic episodes. However, she will continue to be monitored for further respiratory events. A final read of the morning chest X-ray is pending.

The patient has stable anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to multiple etiologies including HIV, Hepatitis C, and previous concern of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with HIV and Hep C cirrhosis who presents from OSH for
   management of SBP and HRS who had acute respiratory decompensation in
   the setting of fluid overload.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Improving. All head imaging to date negative.
   No obvious seizure activity. Likely hepatic encephalopathy with renal
   failure.
   - continue lactulose 30q6hr
   - continue rifaximin
   - Giving thiamine and folate
   - Can hold off on further work-up for now given significantly improved
   mental status (no need for LP or neuro consult)
   # ARF: likely is oliguric renal failure secondary to hepatic renal
   syndrome. Creatinine is downtrending and she is increasing her urine
   output.
   - renal continuing to hold off on HD for now given improvement.
   - Renal will pull HD catheter today
 will give FFP prior to pulling
   the line
   - f/u final renal recs
   - renally dose HIV medications and antibiotics
   - Currently off octeotride and midodrine
   # Hypernatremia
147 today, down from 150 after getting 2L D5Q and
   increased free water flushes. Likely due to relative dehydration. [**Name2 (NI) **]
   water deficit ~2.3.
   - As we advance her diet she will likey self-correct.
   - F/u PM lytes
   # Respiratory Distress/Apnea/Volume Overload: Post extubation, no more
   apneic episodes
   - Continue to monitor for further apneic events
   - F/u final read of AM CXR

s CXR
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Multiple etiologies likely,
   including HIV, Hep C, previous concern of DIC. No obvious source of
   bleeding. Platelets are improving. Hemolysis labs positive for ongoing
   hemolysis (increased LDH, decreased fibrinogen, increased total and
   indirect bilirubin, increased LDH). But these have been abnormal in
   past, and some of these markers may be explained by cirrhosis.
   - Check reticulocyte count.
   - F/u peripheral smear
   - Transfuse for Hct<21, Platelets <10 or signs of active bleeding
   # ESBL UTI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with HIV and Hepatitis C cirrhosis, admitted for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She presented with acute respiratory decompensation in the setting of fluid overload. The patient has been improving, with improved mental status, increased urine output, and downtrending creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy with renal failure: The patient has altered mental status, which is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The presence of renal failure may worsen the condition.
2. Oliguric renal failure secondary to HRS: The patient's renal function is impaired, leading to oliguric renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating hypernatremia. It is likely due to relative dehydration. Monitoring electrolyte levels and ensuring adequate fluid intake are essential.
4. Respiratory distress/apnea/volume overload: The patient experienced respiratory distress and apneic episodes, but these have resolved after extubation. Continuous monitoring for further respiratory issues is necessary.
5. Anemia/thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable anemia and thrombocytopenia, possibly due to HIV, Hepatitis C, or previous concern of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of HIV, HCV, ESLD, portal hypertension, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has shown improvement overall, but continues to have ongoing hepatic encephalopathy. She has been on lactulose and rifaximin for this condition. The patient also has acute renal failure, which is being monitored and managed with fluid repletion as needed. She was treated with meropenem for an ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in her urine and is continuing with HAART for HIV. The patient is nearing the end of her course of ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. She has completed a hydrocortisone taper for adrenal insufficiency and received fresh frozen plasma prior to the removal of her hemodialysis catheter. Her hemoglobin level is stable, and she will be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and potentially progress to coma if not managed properly.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which may result in the buildup of waste products and toxins in the body. This can further worsen her overall health if not addressed.
3. Hyperkalemia: Elevated levels of potassium in the blood"
