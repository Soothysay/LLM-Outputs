","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma, seasonal allergies, dilated cardiomyopathy, and a low ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. She presented with worsening shortness of breath in the context of sinusitis/URI and was found to have a left ventricular (LV) thrombus on echocardiogram. The etiology of the dilated cardiomyopathy is unclear. She has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis regularly over the past three weeks and during her stay. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, and she has a history of steroid-induced diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with various medications including milrinone, heparin, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% indicates severe systolic dysfunction. This puts her at risk for further cardiac complications such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, and potentially cardiogenic shock.
2. LV Thrombus: The presence of an LV thrombus increases the risk of embolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization. Anticoagulation therapy is essential to prevent clot formation and potential complications.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of asthma and recent URI suggest a predisposition to respiratory distress. Ongoing monitoring and management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma and seasonal allergies. She presented with a 3-week history of worsening shortness of breath (SOB) in the context of sinusitis/upper respiratory infection (URI), and was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. She was transferred to the CCU for hypotension and decreased urine output (UOP).

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. PUMP: Dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction and EF 15%. The etiology is unclear, and a left ventricular thrombus was found on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). There are no prior EKGs for comparison, and no history of recent ischemic events. Given the temporal relationship with recent URI, it may be an infectious etiology. Cardiac enzyme levels (CES) are negative on four occasions, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are normal.

Plan:
- Continue lasix gtt with goal I/O -2L, consider adding milrinone if UOP tapers off, support with pressors as needed.
- Monitor electrolytes daily.
- Continue telemetry monitoring and consider cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) for further evaluation of a scar.
- Will need cardiac catheterization once hemodynamically stabilized.
- Continue low-dose beta-block"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma and seasonal allergies.
- She presents with a 3-week history of worsening shortness of breath (SOB) in the context of sinusitis/upper respiratory infection (URI), and was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%.
- The patient has been transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension and decreased urine output (UOP).
- She has a left ventricular (LV) thrombus on echocardiogram, and there are no prior electrocardiograms (EKGs) for comparison, with no history of recent ischemic event.
- The temporal relationship to recent URI may suggest an infectious etiology, although further evaluation is needed.
- The patient's rhythm has transitioned from sinus tachycardia to rates consistently below 100, possibly due to beta-blocker therapy.
- There is no known history of coronary artery disease (CAD), but an EKG shows left bundle branch block (LBBB). Troponins have been flat since admission.
- The patient has a long-standing history of asthma, which is currently being managed with Spiriva, Pulmicort, and Xopenex nebs.
- She has steroid-induced diabetes mellitus (SIM) with a HbA1c of 8.1% on admission.
- The patient has an LV throm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma and seasonal allergies who presented with a 3-week history of worsening shortness of breath in the context of sinusitis/upper respiratory infection (URI). She was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, which led to her transfer to the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension and decreased urine output.

The patient's current condition shows that she is still experiencing shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. She has a low ejection fraction, and an echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular (LV) thrombus. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, and she has evidence of air trapping on chest CT angiogram.

The patient's medical team has implemented several plans to manage her conditions. They will continue with lasix gtt to achieve an intake/output balance of -2 to -3 liters, add milrinone if her urine output tapers off, and support her with pressors as needed. They will also monitor her electrolytes daily, perform a cardiac catheterization, and continue low-dose beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Strict intake/output monitoring, daily weights, a low-salt diet, and free water restriction are also part of her management plan.

For her rhythm, they will continue beta-blockade as tolerated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma and seasonal allergies. She presents with worsening shortness of breath in the context of sinusitis/URI and is found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. She was transferred to the CCU for hypotension and decreased urine output. The patient has a left ventricular (LV) thrombus and requires anticoagulation therapy. She also has evidence of air trapping on chest X-ray, indicating underlying asthma. The patient's nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis are likely related to bowel congestion due to volume overload. Her liver function tests are mildly elevated, but there is no evidence of obstruction on right upper quadrant ultrasound. The patient's elevated hemoglobin A1c suggests possible steroid-induced diabetes mellitus. She will be closely monitored for any complications and her condition will be reassessed regularly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. LV thrombus: The presence of a left ventricular thrombus increases the risk of systemic embolization, which can lead to ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or peripheral arterial embolism.
2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: This condition can result in heart failure symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and edema. It can also lead to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.
3. Steroid-induced diabetes mellitus: The patient's elevated hemoglobin A1c indicates possible development of diabetes mell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma, seasonal allergies, and sinusitis/upper respiratory infection (URI) who presents with worsening shortness of breath. She was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension and decreased urine output. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium, milrinone, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has cool extremities and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels, as well as decreased platelet count, creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's medical plan includes continuing lasix gtt with a goal of I/O -2-3L, adding milrinone if urine output tapers off, supporting with pressors as needed, monitoring [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, daily EKG/telemetry monitoring, considering cardiac MRI for further evaluation of a scar, and cardiac catheterization once hemodynamically stabilized.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma and seasonal allergies. She presents with a three-week history of worsening shortness of breath in the context of sinusitis/URI. The patient has been found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% and was transferred to the CCU for hypotension and decreased urine output.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. PUMP: The patient has dilated left ventricular dysfunction with severe systolic dysfunction and an EF of 15%. The etiology is unclear, and a left ventricular thrombus has been found on transthoracic echocardiography. The temporal relationship to recent URI suggests a possible infectious etiology. Coronary artery disease has been ruled out, and there is no history of recent ischemic events.

2. RHYTHM: The patient was initially in sinus tachycardia but is now consistently below 100 beats per minute. Beta-blockers will be continued as tolerated, and assessment for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement will be made as an outpatient when the patient is stable.

3. CORONARIES: No known history of coronary artery disease (CAD) is present. The electrocardiogram (EKG) shows left bundle branch block (LBBB). Troponins have remained flat since admission.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma, seasonal allergies, and dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%). She presented with worsening shortness of breath in the context of sinusitis/URI. The patient was transferred to the CCU for hypotension and decreased urine output. She has a left ventricular thrombus on TTE, and the cause of her dilated cardiomyopathy is unclear. The patient's recent echocardiograms show severe pulmonary artery hypertension and severely elevated wedge pressure. She has been on various medications including heparin, lasix, milrinone, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, aspirin, and H2 blockers. The patient also has a history of steroid-induced diabetes mellitus and is being monitored for potential complications related to her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
   - Heart failure exacerbation due to impaired cardiac function and fluid overload.
   - Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia due to underlying cardiomyopathy or electrolyte imbalances.
   - Increased risk of systemic embolism due to the presence of a left ventricular thrombus.

2. Pulmonary Complications:
   - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure.
   - Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia due to aspiration or prolonged intubation.

6. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) without evidence of obstruction on right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ US).
7. Nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis for the past three weeks.
8. Elevated LFTs possibly secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or hepatic congestion from impaired right ventricular function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart failure exacerbation due to the severely reduced EF.
2. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias due to the presence of left ventricular thrombus.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma, seasonal allergies, and dilated cardiomyopathy. She presents with a 3-week history of worsening shortness of breath in the context of sinusitis/upper respiratory infection. The patient was found to have severe systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 15% and a left ventricular thrombus on transthoracic echocardiogram. She also has pulmonary artery hypertension and elevated wedge pressure. The patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit for hypotension and decreased urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe systolic dysfunction.
2. Development of ventricular arrhythmias or complete heart block due to left bundle branch block and potential need for pacemaker placement.
3. Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload and impaired right ventricular function.
4. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and decreased venous return.
5. Hepatic congestion and elevated liver enzymes due to impaired right ventricular function.
6. Diabetic ketoacidosis or steroid-induced diabetes mellitus exacerbation.
7. Aspiration pneumonia or respiratory failure due to decreased protective airway reflexes.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease due to stress ulcers from critical illness.
9. Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.
10. Systemic infection or sepsis"

The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma, seasonal allergies, and sinusitis/upper respiratory infection (URI). She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. She also has a left ventricular (LV) thrombus. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate (HR) ranging from 91-113 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 106/82-91/18 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%. The patient is on various medications including heparin, furosemide, and milrinone. 

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of potassium (K+) at 5.8 me/L, glucose at 237 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 252 IU/L. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is within normal range, while hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet (Plt) counts are slightly lower than normal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma and seasonal allergies who presented with worsening shortness of breath in the context of sinusitis/upper respiratory infection. She was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15% and is being treated in the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension and decreased urine output. Initially thought to be viral myocarditis, it is now assumed to be ischemic in nature. A left ventricular thrombus was also identified on echocardiogram.

Medical Complications:
1. Dilated cardiomyopathy with severe systolic dysfunction and ejection fraction of 15%.
2. Left ventricular thrombus.
3. Possible ischemic etiology of myocarditis.
4. History of asthma with evidence of air trapping on computed tomography angiography.
5. Steroid-induced diabetes mellitus with HbA1c of 8.1% on admission.
6. Nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis with mildly elevated liver function tests.
7. Elevated liver function tests possibly secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or hepatic congestion from impaired right ventricular function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart failure exacerbation due to worsening cardiac function.
2. Thromboembolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism due to the presence of a left ventricular thrombus.

   Assessment and Plan
   46 F with history of asthma and seasonal allergies who presents with
   3-week history of worsening SOB in context of sinusitis/URI, found to
   have dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 15% transferred to the CCU for
   hypotension and decreased UOP.   Originally thought to be viral
   myocarditis, now assuming ischemic.
   .
   # PUMP:  Dilated LV with severe sys dysfxn EF 15% of likely ischemic
   etiology. LV thrombus found on TTE.  CEs neg x4. TSH nl.  On Cath
   PASP
 66, Wedge - 40
   - continue lasix gtt w/ goal I/O -2-3L
 Lasix stopped yesterday [**3-8**]
   great output
   - monitor [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, daily EKG/continue telemetry monitoring
   - continue low dose BB, ACE with strict holding parameters - uptitrate
   as tolerated
   - strict I/Os, daily weights, low salt diet/1500cc free water
   restriction
 goal (- 1.5-2)
   - continue heparin for LV thrombus, hold on coumadin bridge until
   further evaluation
   .
   # RHYTHM: Was in sinus tach on presentation. Now with rates
   consistently <100.
   - Continue beta blockade as tolerated.
   - Patient may benefit from BiV pacer given LBBB (widened QRS) vs. ICD
   placement.  EP following.
   - Cardiac MR to establish scar prior to ICD, ? BIV Pacer
   .
   # CORONARIES: No prior known history of CAD. EKG with LBBB. Troponins
   flat since admission.  2VD noted on cath, s/p [**Hospital1 **] (Endeavor)

   - f/u MR results
   - Changed omeprazole to H2 blocker
   - Bival in cath
   - plavix loaded
   - Statin on board
   - Aspirin 325 for at least 3 mos., then 162 mg
   - Plavix must be continued for 3 mos s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6618**] (Endeavor),
   ideally 12 mos.
   .
   # Asthma: Long standing w/ evidence of air trapping on CTA. Had been on
   long-standing predinsone and now off, no evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency on random cortisol.
   - Continue Spiriva
   - switch pulmicort to advair while inpatient
   - cont Xopenex nebs to avoid contributing to tachycardia
   - Will hold off on prednisone for now
   - O2 PRN for SOB
   .
   # Steroid Induced Diabetes Mellitus HbA1c = 8.1 % on admission.
   Question steroids as cause although does have family history with
   mother having type II. Will recommend outpatient follow up on
   discharge.
   - Continue HISS and check FS QID
   - establish fixed dose insulin requirements, insulin teaching as
   patient will need insulin on discharge
   - discuss [**Last Name (un) 303**] consult with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # LV thrombus. Noted on echocardiogram as above.
   - Continue heparin gtt titrated to goal PTT 60-100
   - can start coumadin now that no new procedures are indicated.
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting/diaphoresis. Patient has had N/V regularly over the
   past 3 weeks and during her stay so far. LFTs mildly elevated without
   evidence of obstruction on RUQ US from admission. Possibly related to
   bowel congestion from volume overload.
   - Zofran PRN for nausea
   - f/u lipase
   - switched to H2 blocker given that patient now on Plavix
   .
   # Elevated LFTs. Appear stable. Hep A, Hep B serology negative.
   Possibly secondary to NASH or hepatic congestion from impaired right
   ventricular function. Have been slowly down trending.  resolved

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma and seasonal allergies who presented with a 3-week history of worsening shortness of breath in the context of sinusitis/upper respiratory infection. She was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%, likely due to ischemic etiology. A left ventricular thrombus was also identified on transthoracic echocardiography. The patient was initially thought to have viral myocarditis but is now presumed to be ischemic in nature.

The patient has been in the intensive care unit (ICU) since admission and has received various treatments including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, anticoagulation therapy, and statins. She has been closely monitored for her vital signs, electrolyte levels, and cardiac function.

The patient's medical complications include dilated cardiomyopathy with severe systolic dysfunction, left ventricular thrombus, nausea/vomiting/diaphoresis, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and steroid-induced diabetes mellitus. The patient's asthma has also been managed during her stay.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias, stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and further deterioration of liver function. Regular monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent these complications and optimize the patient's condition."
