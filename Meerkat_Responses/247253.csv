","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient required non-invasive ventilation but was not tolerating it well, leading to the initiation of invasive ventilation. The patient has been intubated to maintain oxygenation and is currently on high-dose fentanyl/versed sedation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension overnight on sedation with high-dose fentanyl/versed. This could indicate a potential complication of the medications or a underlying cardiovascular issue.
2. Pneumonia/Aspiration: The patient's respiratory failure suggests the possibility of pneumonia or aspiration. The presence of rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally may support this assessment.
3. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which requires appropriate pain management in the ICU setting.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids (total in 1,096 mL and 3,112 mL) but has also had a substantial output (total out 730 mL and 220 mL). Monitoring the patient's fluid balance is crucial to prevent complications such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show low levels of potassium (K+: 3.3 mEq/L), magnesium (Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL), and phosphate (PO4: 2.8 mg/dL), which may require correction to prevent complications related to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and renal function.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information or further evaluation might be required to provide a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M admitted with pneumonia on [**Hospital 4659**]
   transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of
   aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  ARDS given b/l infiltrates, current vent
   requirements.  Likely [**1-27**] to aspiration pneumonitis, but concern for
   worsening pneumonia.  Broadening antibiotics overnight empirically
   while culture data pending.  Goal of low tidal volumes and high peep as
   tolerated by systolic pressures.
   - Intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings.
   - Vanco/Zosyn now.
   - Urine legionella -> negative earlier this hospital stay
   - sputum culture -> resend now.
   - blood cultures -> resend now.
   - NPO except meds.
   - Check ECG, BNP
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely from massive inflammatory response from ARDS
   although unclear what contribution medications may play in current
   hypotension.  Not particularly fluid responsive overnight with boluses
   of 2.5L.  Tolerating hypotension well with adequate urine output.
   -          will place CVL today
   -          a. line prn.
   .
   # N/V/diarrhea:  Reportedly resolved, zofran PRN.  continue to follow.
   - zofran prn
   - send stool if diarrhea returns
   - monitor hct and guaiac stools
   .
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   .
   # CAD:  Repeat CE's now, BNP, and ECG to r/o ischemic component to
   presentation.
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications
   .
   # Chronic pain:  Mainly in the setting of neuropathy.  ? in setting of
   DM although this has been well controlled with a1c consistently <6%.
   - continue outpatient pain regimen with duragesic patch, neurontin,
   oxycodone prn.
   - avoid oversedation given tentative respiratory status
   .
   # Lung nodule:  Noted on [**10-2**] CT abd and appeared more prominent than
   [**1-/2176**] study measuring 8mm.  6 month f/u imaging was recommended.  Does
   have possible left lung base infiltrate as well but mass not visualized
   on CXR and seems less likely to represent postobstructive pneumonia.
   .
   # Anemia:  Baseline hct fluctuates somewhat, but appears most
   consistently mid 30s.  Low MCV with h/o iron deficiency, but patient
   reports he is not taking iron any longer.  Iron studies from [**2174**] c/w
   Fe deficiency.  B12 and folate normal in [**10-2**].  Guaiac negative on
   exam in the ED.  No c-scope in our system since [**2167**] at which time poor
   prep, but did not show significant pathology.
   - continue iron therapy
   .
   # h/o HCV infection: stable. pt reported history of Hep C infection,
   but no active RUQ pain or abnormal LFTs. Confirmed anti-HCV Ab
   positivity, no viral load in our system. HepB serologies negative for
   past/prior infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible aspiration. He was initially placed on non-invasive ventilation but did not tolerate it well and was subsequently intubated. The patient is currently on invasive mechanical ventilation with ARDSNet settings. His condition is complicated by hypotension, likely due to the massive inflammatory response from ARDS, as well as N/V/diarrhea, which has resolved but will be monitored. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, chronic pain managed with a fentanyl patch and neurontin, and a lung nodule that was found on imaging. Other medical issues include anemia, previous HCV infection, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a history of fenfluramine use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's initial admission was for pneumonia, and there is concern for worsening pneumonia due to aspiration. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically while culture data is pending.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure has progressed to ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory distress. Management involves low tidal volumes and high PEEP as tolerated by systolic pressures.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely due to the massive inflammatory response from AR"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M admitted with pneumonia on [**Hospital 4659**]
   transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of
   aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  CXR with worsening bilateral airspace opacities
   R>L.  Hypoxia this PM most likely [**1-27**] aspiration given timing and h/o
   aspiration in past.  Patient ruled out for influenza this hospital
   stay.  No LE swelling to suggest PE, and not volume overloaded on exam
   to suggest heart failure.  Will add flagyl given possibility that
   initial pneumonia was aspiration event.
   - BiPap for now with consideration of intubation if unable to tolerate
   BiPap but currently satting well.
   - Levofloxacin for CAP -> add flagyl now
   - Urine legionella -> negative earlier this hospital stay
   - sputum culture -> resend now.
   - blood cultures -> resend now.
   - NPO except meds.
   - Check ECG, BNP
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Given infiltrates, appears to be in setting of pneumonia.
   Has chest discomfort with deep inspiration and with coughing and
   suspect musculoskeletal from coughing.  Have been able to wean off NRB
   and is currently maintaining O2 sats >93% on NC.
   - continue to wean supplemental O2 as possible
   .
   # N/V/diarrhea:  Reportedly resolved, zofran PRN.  continue to follow.
   - zofran prn
   - send stool if diarrhea returns
   - monitor hct and guaiac stools
   .
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   .
   # CAD:  Repeat CE's now, BNP, and ECG to r/o ischemic component to
   presentation.
   - continue ASA, statin
   .
   # Chronic pain:  Mainly in the setting of neuropathy.  ? in setting of
   DM although this has been well controlled with a1c consistently <6%.
   - continue outpatient pain regimen with duragesic patch, neurontin,
   oxycodone prn.
   - avoid oversedation given tentative respiratory status
   .
   # Lung nodule:  Noted on [**10-2**] CT abd and appeared more prominent than
   [**1-/2176**] study measuring 8mm.  6 month f/u imaging was recommended.  Does
   have possible left lung base infiltrate as well but mass not visualized
   on CXR and seems less likely to represent postobstructive pneumonia.
   .
   # Anemia:  Baseline hct fluctuates somewhat, but appears most
   consistently mid 30s.  Low MCV with h/o iron deficiency, but patient
   reports he is not taking iron any longer.  Iron studies from [**2174**] c/w
   Fe deficiency.  B12 and folate normal in [**10-2**].  Guaiac negative on
   exam in the ED.  No c-scope in our system since [**2167**] at which time poor
   prep, but did not show significant pathology.
   - continue iron therapy
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # h/o HCV infection: stable. pt reported history of Hep C infection,
   but no active RUQ pain or abnormal LFTs. Confirmed anti-HCV Ab
   positivity, no viral load in our system. HepB serologies negative for
   past/prior infection.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue pravastatin
   .
   # HTN: Continue diltiazem, will switch to short acting for now.
   .
   # Asthma: PFTs in our system last from [**2168**] at which time they were
   normal.
   - continue home ipratropium prn; add albuterol prn
   .
   # BPH: Cont home finasteride.
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, cardiac, diabetic diet.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted with pneumonia and transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of aspiration. The patient has a history of aspiration in the past. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Respiratory Failure: The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. The patient is hypoxic and most likely experiencing aspiration given the timing and history of previous aspiration events. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or heart failure. The patient will be placed on BiPap for now, with consideration of intubation if unable to tolerate BiPap. Levofloxacin will be given for community-acquired pneumonia, and Flagyl will be added due to the possibility that the initial pneumonia was an aspiration event. Blood cultures and sputum culture will be resent.

- Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation appears to be in the setting of pneumonia. The patient has chest discomfort with deep inspiration and coughing, which is likely musculoskeletal from coughing. The patient is currently maintaining O2 saturation above 93% on NC. Supplemental O2 will be weaned off as possible.

- N/V/diarrhea: The patient reported resolution of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and will continue to take Zofran PRN. Stool will be sent if diarrhea returns, and the patient's hemoglobin and guaiac stools will be monitored.

- DM2: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is diet-controlled at home. Insulin sliding scale will be used while in the hospital.

- CAD: Repeat cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECG will be done to rule out ischemic component to the presentation. The patient will continue taking aspirin and a statin.

- Chronic pain: The patient has chronic pain mainly due to neuropathy, possibly related to diabetes. The patient will continue with the outpatient pain regimen of a durable patch, Neurontin, and oxycodone PRN. However, caution should be taken regarding oversedation given the patient's respiratory status.

- Lung nodule: A lung nodule was noted on a CT abdomen from 10/2 and appeared more prominent compared to a previous study measuring 8mm. A follow-up imaging after 6 months was recommended. However, there is a possible left lung base infiltrate as well, but the mass does not seem to represent postobstructive pneumonia on the chest X-ray.

- Anemia: The patient has a baseline hematocrit that fluctuates, but appears consistently in the mid-30s. The patient has a history of iron deficiency, but has not been taking iron supplements. Iron studies from 2014 are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. B12 and folate levels are normal, and there are no signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient will continue iron therapy and have guaiac tests on all stools"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old man with recent MICU stay for CAP, now represents with
   hypoxic respiratory failure [**1-27**] aspiration. Now intubated. Wean fio2
   and (when Fi02 0.40) PEEP for Pa02 > 60.
   Lung protective ventilation with target Vt 6cc/kg. Agree with
   vanc/zosyn pending cultures but presentation is also consistent with
   aspiration pneumonitis. Hypotension related to hypovolemia, sedation
   and low SVR [**1-27**] aspiration event. Will bolus IVF today and place CVC,
   levophed as needed. Further plans as per resident note.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M admitted with pneumonia on [**Hospital 4659**]
   transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of
   aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  ARDS given b/l infiltrates, current vent
   requirements.  Likely [**1-27**] to aspiration pneumonitis, but concern for
   worsening pneumonia.  ?MRSA pneumonia given blood cultures.  Changed
   antibiotics yesterday to vanco/ceftazidime.  Weaning TV and opting for
   increased PEEP given ARDS.  P/F ratio improved to 167 today and CXR
   improving.
   - Intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings.
   -Vanco/Ceftaz -> narrow to vanco monotherapy in 24 hours if now new
   culture growth
   -f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, ?role of sepsis.
   Minimally fluid responsive with ongoing pressor requirement. Good UOP
   with stable creatinine.  [**Month (only) 51**] still have some degree of fluid
   responsiveness by chest x-ray findings, so would consider further fluid
   bolus if unable to wean pressors.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated with goal MAP > 60
   -Check CVP today
   .
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol, versed, and fentanyl.  Attempt to
   wean fentanyl/versed given potential contribution to sedation.
   Uptitrate propofol, and wean fentanyl/versed
   - continue fentanyl patches
   .
   # N/V/diarrhea:  Resolved, continue to follow.
   - send stool if diarrhea returns
   - monitor hct and guaiac stools
   .
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   .
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications

","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted with pneumonia who has been transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 163, indicating severe ARDS. The chest X-ray reveals widespread alveolar process affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left, particularly in the right upper lobe. There is also a suggestion of several poorly defined nodular opacities within the left lower lung. Small right pleural effusion has not substantially changed. The patient has been started on vancomycin and ceftazidime for suspected MRSA pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 127/63 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute (due to mechanical ventilation), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated with propofol, versed, and fentanyl. 

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, chronic pain, lung nodule, anemia, hepatitis C infection, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and familial hypertriglyceridemia. 

The patient's current medications include insulin sliding scale, aspirin"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M admitted with pneumonia on [**Hospital 4659**]
   transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of
   aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  ARDS given b/l infiltrates, current vent
   requirements.  Likely [**1-27**] to aspiration pneumonitis, but concern for
   worsening pneumonia.  ?MRSA pneumonia given blood cultures.  Changed
   antibiotics yesterday to vanco/ceftazidime.  Weaning TV and opting for
   increased PEEP given ARDS.  P/F ratio improved to 167 today and CXR
   improving.
   - Intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings.
   -Vanco/Ceftaz -> narrow to vanco monotherapy in 24 hours if now new
   culture growth
   -f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   - d/c flagyl
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, ?role of sepsis,
   now on minimal pressors and likely due to role of propofol for
   sedation.  Good UOP with stable creatinine.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated with goal MAP > 60
   -Check CVP today, attempt to diurese given benefit shown of low CVP in
   patients with ARDS.
   .
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol. versed, and fentanyl weaned to off.
   - continue fentanyl patches
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Increase free water boluses with tube feeds.
   .
   # N/V/diarrhea:  Resolved, continue to follow.
   - send stool if diarrhea returns
   - monitor hct and guaiac stools
   .
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   .
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications
   .
   # Chronic pain:  Mainly in the setting of neuropathy.  ? in setting of
   DM although this has been well controlled with a1c consistently <6%.
   -continue duragesic patches now.
   - avoid oversedation given tentative respiratory status

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted with pneumonia and later transferred to the ICU for desaturation in the setting of aspiration. The patient is currently diagnosed with respiratory failure due to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis and worsening pneumonia. The patient's hypotension is likely related to systemic response to ARDS, possibly with a role of sepsis, and he is on minimal pressors. The patient's sedation involves propofol, versed, and fentanyl, and plans are to wean off sedatives. The patient also has hypernatremia, which requires increasing free water boluses with tube feeds.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening of respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of the ARDS, and potential sepsis due to the ongoing infection. Additionally, there is a concern for the patient's chronic pain management, particularly in the setting of neuropathy, as well as managing his diabetes mellitus type 2 and chronic kidney disease. The patient's recent history of lung nodule and anemia should also be monitored closely. 

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate assessment of the patient's condition and potential complications."

   Endotracheal tube
   has been advanced and now terminates about 6 cm above the carina.
   Nasogastric
   tube continues to terminate in the stomach with side port in close
   proximity
   to the GE junction. Widespread alveolar process affecting the right
   lung to a greater degree than the left is slightly worse compared to
   the previous study, particularly in the right upper lobe. Additionally,
   within the left lower lung, there is a suggestion of several poorly
   defined nodular opacities. Small right pleural effusion has not
   substantially changed.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M admitted with pneumonia on [**Hospital 4659**]
   transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of
   aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  ARDS given b/l infiltrates, current vent
   requirements.  Likely [**1-27**] to aspiration pneumonitis, but concern for
   worsening pneumonia.  ?MRSA pneumonia given blood cultures.  Changed
   antibiotics yesterday to vanco/ceftazidime.  Weaning TV and opting for
   increased PEEP given ARDS.  P/F ratio improved to 167 today and CXR
   improving.
   - Intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings.
   -Vanco/Ceftaz -> narrow to vanco monotherapy in 24 hours if now new
   culture growth
   -f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, ?role of sepsis.
   Minimally fluid responsive with ongoing pressor requirement. Good UOP
   with stable creatinine.  [**Month (only) 51**] still have some degree of fluid
   responsiveness by chest x-ray findings, so would consider further fluid
   bolus if unable to wean pressors.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated with goal MAP > 60
   -Check CVP today
   .
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol, versed, and fentanyl.  Attempt to
   wean fentanyl/versed given potential contribution to sedation.
   Uptitrate propofol, and wean fentanyl/versed
   - continue fentanyl patches
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Increase free water boluses with tube feeds.
   .
   # N/V/diarrhea:  Resolved, continue to follow.
   - send stool if diarrhea returns
   - monitor hct and guaiac stools
   .
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   .
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications
   .
   # Chronic pain:  Mainly in the setting of neuropathy.  ? in setting of
   DM although this has been well controlled with a1c consistently <6%.
   -continue duragesic patches now.
   - avoid oversedation given tentative respiratory status
   .
   # Lung nodule:  Noted on [**10-2**] CT abd and appeared more prominent than
   [**1-/2176**] study measuring 8mm.  6 month f/u imaging was recommended.  Does
   have possible left lung base infiltrate as well but mass not visualized
   on CXR and seems less likely to represent postobstructive pneumonia.
   .
   # Anemia:  Stable.  Baseline hct fluctuates somewhat, but appears most
   consistently mid 30s.  Low MCV with h/o iron deficiency, but patient
   reports he is not taking iron any longer.  Iron studies from [**2174**] c/w
   Fe deficiency.  B12 and folate normal in [**10-2**].  Guaiac negative on
   exam in the ED.  No c-scope in our system since [**2167**] at which time poor
   prep, but did not show significant pathology.
   - continue iron therapy
   .
   # h/o HCV infection: stable. pt reported history of Hep C infection,
   but no active RUQ pain or abnormal LFTs. Confirmed anti-HCV Ab
   positivity, no viral load in our system. HepB serologies negative for
   past/prior infection.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue pravastatin
   .
   # HTN: Hold BP medications
   .
   # Asthma: PFTs in our system last from [**2168**] at which time they were
   normal.
   - continue home ipratropium prn; add albuterol prn  -> no indication
   for steroids at this time.
   .
   # BPH: Holding home finasteride.
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, cardiac, diabetic diet.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin.  On PPI as outpatient.
   # Access: PIVs., CVL
   # Code: FULL.
   # Communication: Patient and son

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. On low
   tidal volume ventilation. S. Aureus in sputm and blood now so etiology
   likely aspiration plus
   staph pneumonia. Continue broad abx pending finalization of cultures.
   Can DC flagyl. Will check CVP today. On very minimal pressors in the
   setting of sedation
   so would favor diuresis today with goal TBB -500 to 1L. Further plans
   as per resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and subsequently developed respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) on low tidal volume ventilation. The patient has an infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, likely due to aspiration and subsequent pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further plans will be made based on the resident's note. The patient requires careful management of his critical condition, including close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

   68 year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. On low
   tidal volume ventilation. S. Aureus in sputum and blood now so etiology
   likely aspiration plus staph pneumonia. Continue broad abx pending
   finalization of cultures. Can DC flagyl. Will check CVP today. On very
   minimal pressors in the setting of sedation
   so would favor diuresis today with goal TBB -500 to 1L. Further plans
   as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and now presents with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been transferred to the MICU and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, and an increased respiratory rate. He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, diuretics, and other ICU supportive care. His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, normal kidney function, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus infection in both the sputum and blood, suggesting aspiration pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already critically ill with ARDS and on mechanical ventilation, making him at high risk for developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: Due to his prolonged stay in the ICU, the patient may be at risk of acquiring additional nosocomial infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of blood clots, which can lead to DVT and potentially life-threatening PE.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's fluid balance shows a significant positive balance, indicating the possibility of fluid overload, which can contribute to AKI.

   abutting the right
   lateral wall of the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet.
   Widespread
   asymmetrical multifocal areas of consolidation appear slightly
   improved,
   likely due to multifocal pneumonia. Probable small left pleural

   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M admitted with pneumonia on [**Hospital 4659**]
   transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of
   aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  ARDS given b/l infiltrates, current vent
   requirements with P/F of 182 currently.  Likely [**1-27**] to aspiration
   pneumonitis, but concern for MRSA pneumonia.  Continuing antibiotics.
   Weaning TV and opting for increased PEEP given ARDS.  P/F ratio
   improved today
   - Intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings.
   - Narrow to nafcililn today, continue to follow clinically
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, ?role of sepsis and
   propofol for sedation, now on minimal pressors, good UOP with stable
   creatinine.  CVP continues to be elevated from goal
   -Wean pressors as tolerated with goal MAP > 60
   -Check CVP today, attempt to diurese given benefit shown of low CVP in
   patients with ARDS.
   .
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol. versed, and fentanyl weaned to off.
   - continue fentanyl patches and propofol
   - daily wake up
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Increase free water boluses with tube feeds.  Repeat
   Sodium q8H today.
   .
   #Anisicoria: Not previously noted.  Daily wake-ups to assess mental
   status, pupils reactive which is reassuring.
   - With sedation weaned is moving all extremities and agitated,
   anisicoria resolved this AM.
   .
   # N/V/diarrhea:  Resolved, continue to follow.
    - send stool if diarrhea returns
   - monitor hct and guaiac stools
   .
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   .
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications

   # Chronic pain:  Mainly in the setting of neuropathy.  ? in setting of
   DM although this has been well controlled with a1c consistently <6%.
   -continue duragesic patches now.
   - avoid oversedation given tentative respiratory status

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and is being treated with appropriate antibiotics. His condition has shown some improvement, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Measures should be taken to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and ensuring proper secretion clearance.

2. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and central line-associated thrombophlebitis (CLABSI). Careful monitoring of the patient's lines and prompt removal if necessary is crucial.

3. Barotrauma: ARDS patients are at risk for barotrauma, which is lung injury caused by high airway pressures during mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of airway pressures and adjustment of ventilator settings are essential to minimize this risk.

4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload. Excessive fluid administration can worsen pulmonary edema and increase the risk of complications like heart failure.

5. Sepsis: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the"

   # Respiratory Failure:  ARDS given b/l infiltrates, current vent
   requirements with P/F of 182 currently.  Likely [**1-27**] to aspiration
   pneumonitis, but concern for MRSA pneumonia.  Continuing antibiotics.
   Weaning TV and opting for increased PEEP given ARDS.  P/F ratio
   improved to 167 today and CXR improving.
   - Intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings.
   -Vanco/Ceftaz -> consider narrowing to vancomycin monotherapy today.
   -f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, ?role of sepsis,
   now on minimal pressors and likely due to role of propofol for
   sedation.  Good UOP with stable creatinine.  CVP continues to be
   elevated from goal
   -Wean pressors as tolerated with goal MAP > 60
   -Check CVP today, attempt to diurese given benefit shown of low CVP in
   patients with ARDS.
   .
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol. versed, and fentanyl weaned to off.
   - continue fentanyl patches and propofol
   - daily wake up

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with MSSA pneumonia, bacteremia, aspiration, and ARDS. He is currently on low-dose pressors due to sedation and is being attempted for diuresis. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics since 2176-12-23. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/39 mmHg to 129/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are all noted in the flow sheet data.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has MSSA pneumonia and bacteremia, which can lead to further infections and complications if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition indicates respiratory failure due to ARDS, which may result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential dehydration or fluid loss. This can affect his cardiovascular stability and organ function.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly low at times, indicating hypotension. This can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of shock.
5. Sedation and Paralysis: The patient is sedated and on propofol infusion, which carries risks of propof"

   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M admitted with pneumonia on [**Hospital 4659**]
   transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of
   aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  ARDS given b/l infiltrates, current vent
   requirements with P/F of >200 today.  Cultures confirmed as MSSA so
   narrowed to nafcillin yesterday.  Continue to wean vent as tolerated
   with reducing FiO2 steadily and then weaning PEEP as tolerated.  As
   long as clinically improving and suction is not c/w hemorrhage would
   not raise concern for DAH or pulmonary hemorrhage.
   - Intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings.
   - Narrow to nafcililn today, continue to follow clinically
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, ?role of sepsis and
   propofol for sedation, now on minimal pressors, good UOP with stable
   creatinine.  CVP continues to be elevated from goal
   -Wean pressors as tolerated with goal MAP > 60
   -Check CVP today, attempt to diurese given benefit shown of low CVP in
   patients with ARDS.
   .
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol. versed, and fentanyl weaned to off.
   - continue fentanyl patches and propofol
   - daily wake up
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Resolved, continue to trend Increase free water boluses
   with tube feeds.  Repeat Sodium q8H today.
   .
   # N/V/diarrhea:  Resolved, continue to follow.
    - send stool if diarrhea returns
   - monitor hct and guaiac stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS. The patient's condition has shown improvement with decreasing FiO2 and PEEP settings. His sodium levels have normalized, but he still requires minimal pressors for hypotension. He is also on prophylactic heparin and a PPI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's initial presentation and current condition indicate severe lung injury, leading to ARDS. Continued monitoring and management of respiratory support, oxygenation, and ventilation are necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with pneumonia, which may have contributed to the development of ARDS. Continued surveillance for infection, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and monitoring for signs of sepsis or septic shock are essential.

3. Fluid Management: The patient's CVP has been elevated, indicating a need for careful fluid management. Excess fluid can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory distress. Regular monitoring and adjustments to fluid intake and output are necessary.

4. Bloodstream Infection: As the patient has MSSA in his blood, there is a risk of bloodstream infection. Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and cultures is crucial to detect any signs of infection.

5. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension requires close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status."

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), respiratory failure, hypernatremia (high sodium), pneumonia, aspiration, and pain control. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of the endotracheal tube and potential colonization of the lower respiratory tract.
2. Barotrauma: The high levels of PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) and plateau pressures may increase the risk of barotrauma, which is lung injury caused by excessive pressure.
3. Volutrauma: The high tidal volumes being used for ventilation may lead to volutrauma, which is lung injury caused by overdistension of the alveoli.
4. Oxygen toxicity: The patient is receiving a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 of 50%), which can cause lung injury and oxygen toxicity if maintained for a prolonged period.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is low (100/51 mmHg), indicating potential hypotension. This may require adjustment of vasopressor support to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids (total in 3,902 mL), but the net fluid balance is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to witnessed aspiration. The patient's condition has shown improvement in oxygenation and mechanics. The plan includes checking the chest X-ray today, decreasing PEEP if tolerated, attempting a spontaneous breathing trial, and weaning as able. The patient will continue with diuresis to achieve a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of less than 5 and will try using lasix drip. The patient is still requiring small amounts of levophed while on propofol, so they will continue with diuresis and monitor the pressor requirements once on PSV and attempt to wean propofol. Antibiotics have been switched to Nafcillin based on culture results, and the patient will complete a 7-day course of antibiotics while monitoring the fever curve and white blood cell count on the new regimen. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with additional free water. Pain control will be monitored as sedation is lessened. The patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren Pulmonary (full) at 60 mL/hour and will be monitored for glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line and an arterial line. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (P"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He was treated with levaquin and later transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor, suspected aspiration. The patient developed ARDS and required intubation and ventilation. Cultures confirmed MSSA, so the antibiotic was narrowed to nafcillin. The patient continues to be mechanically ventilated with ARDSNet settings. Blood cultures and sputum cultures are being followed. The patient's hypotension is likely due to systemic response to ARDS, possibly exacerbated by sepsis and propofol sedation. Pressors are being weaned as tolerated, with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) remains elevated from the goal, and diuresis is being attempted given the benefit of low CVP in patients with ARDS. The patient's sedation consists of propofol, versed, and fentanyl, which is being weaned off. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, and free water boluses are being given with tube feeds. Repeat sodium testing is planned. The patient's N/V/diarrhea has resolved, but stool is being sent if diarrhea returns. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is managed with diet controlled at home and an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital. The patient's coronary artery disease is stable, and BP medications are held"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male admitted with pneumonia and transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor due to aspiration. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSNet settings, and cultures have confirmed MSSA, which has been narrowed to nafcillin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Continuing to wean the ventilator as tolerated while monitoring for any signs of worsening respiratory function is important.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to the systemic response to ARDS and possibly sepsis. Weaning off minimal pressors while maintaining a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 is recommended.

3. Sedation: The patient is currently on propofol for sedation. It is important to continue fentanyl patches and propofol while gradually reducing sedation and performing daily wake-up tests.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, but it is important to continue monitoring sodium levels and providing free water boluses as needed.

5. Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea: These symptoms have resolved, but it is important to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and send stool samples if diarrhea recurs.

6. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes is diet-controlled at home, and it"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted with pneumonia and transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor due to aspiration. He has been diagnosed with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His cultures confirmed MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) infection, so he has been narrowed to nafcillin. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 88/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. He is still requiring higher FiO2 with turning and has been weaned off peep to 8 cmH2O. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 301 mL since 12 AM, and his total intake and output are within normal limits. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which is causing respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSNet settings. The plan is to continue weaning the ventilator as tolerated, reducing FiO2 steadily, and then weaning PEEP as tolerated.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely due to the systemic response to ARDS and possible sepsis. He is on minimal pressors and his urine output is stable with a normal creatinine level. The plan"

   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M initially admitted to ICU with
   pneumonia, treated with levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for
   desaturation on the floor in setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Due to aspiration pneumonia. Had ARDS given b/l
   infiltrates, P/F of >200.  Cultures confirmed as MSSA.
   - Continue to wean vent as tolerated with reducing FiO2 steadily and
   then weaning PEEP as tolerated.
   - Intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings.
   - continue nafcililn
   - f/u blood cultures
   - [**12-14**] sputum cultures with oropharyngeal flora
   - daily wake up, RSBI, VAP ppx

   #Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, possible effect of
   propofol for sedation.
   -  no evidence of sepsis, cultures negative
   -  now on minimal pressors, good UOP with stable creatinine.
   - wean pressors as tolerated with goal MAP > 60
   - cautious diuresesis given benefit shown of low CVP in patients with
   ARDS.
   .
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol; versed, and fentanyl weaned to off.
   - continue fentanyl patches and propofol
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Resolved, continue to trend Increase free water boluses
   with tube feeds
   .
   # N/V/diarrhea:  Resolved, continue to follow.
    - send stool if diarrhea returns
   - monitor hct and guaiac stools

The patient is a 68-year-old male who was initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He was treated with levaquin and then transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor, in the setting of aspiration. He developed ARDS and was intubated. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to aspiration, hypotension likely from systemic response to ARDS or effect of propofol for sedation, MSSA bacteremia, hypernatremia, N/V/diarrhea, DM2, CAD, chronic pain (neuropathy), lung nodule, anemia, h/o HCV infection, hyperlipidemia, HTN, asthma, BPH, FEN, prophylaxis, and access issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for continued respiratory failure due to aspiration and ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to systemic response to ARDS or the effect of propofol for sedation. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management of fluids and vasopressors are essential.
3. MSSA Bacteremia: The presence of MSSA bacteremia increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock. Regular surveillance blood cultures and continuation of appropriate antibiotic therapy are required.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS secondary to witnessed aspiration.  Overall
   trend has been improvement in oxygenation and mechanics.  Currently
   tolerating PSV but sats are marginal.  Secretions are copious.
      -Will observe on PSV and adjust PEEP as needed to oxygenate.  Goal
   sats 88-92%
      -Continue to diurese as able, titrate lasix drip to -1L.
      -Continue pulmonary toilet.
    Hypotension:  Able to wean off pressors this AM
      -Will monitor BP with continued diuresis
      -Once on PSV, will try to wean propofol monitor pressor requirement
    Pneumonia:  Abx switched to Nafcillin yesterday given culture
   results.  Secretions are increased today.
      -Check sputum culture and continue nafcillin for now unless spikes
   fever.
    Hypernatremia:  Resolved with additional free water.
    Pain Control: Will monitor requirements as sedation is lessened.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress and potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) secondary to witnessed aspiration. There has been improvement in oxygenation and mechanics, but the patient is still on PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation) with marginal oxygen saturation levels. Secretions are copious.

Potential Complications:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's copious secretions increase the risk of developing VAP. Proper mouth care and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) are being implemented to reduce this risk.
- Barotrauma: The high airway pressures due to mechanical ventilation can cause barotrauma, which is the injury to the lung tissue from excessive pressure. Monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjusting the ventilator settings are important to prevent this complication.
- Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Improperly set ventilator settings can lead to VILI, which includes overdistension of the alveoli and volutrauma. Appropriate ventilator settings and lung-protective strategies should be employed.

2. Hypotension: The patient was able to wean off pressors (vasopressor medications) this morning. Close monitoring of blood pressure with continued diuresis and weaning of propofol will be necessary"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS secondary to witnessed aspiration.  Overall
   trend has been improvement in oxygenation and mechanics.  Currently
   tolerating PSV but sat's are marginal.  Secretions are copious.
      -Will observe on PSV and adjust PEEP as needed to oxygenate.  Goal
   sats 88-92%
      -Continue to diurese as able, titrate lasix drip to -1L.
      -Continue pulmonary toilet.
    Hypotension:  Able to wean off pressors this AM
      -Will monitor BP with continued diuresis
      -Once on PSV, will try to wean propofol monitor pressor requirement
    Pneumonia:  Abx switched to Nafcillin yesterday given culture
   results.  Secretions are increased today.
      -Check sputum culture and continue nafcillin for now unless spikes
   fever.
    Hypernatremia:  Resolved with additional free water.
    Pain Control: Will monitor requirements as sedation is lessened.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is improving, with better oxygenation and mechanics. However, the patient still requires respiratory support and is on PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation) with marginal saturation levels. The patient's secretions are copious, and they are tolerating PSV well. The patient was able to wean off pressors this morning, but will be monitored closely for any signs of hypotension. The patient's antibiotics have been changed to Nafcillin due to positive culture results. There is a concern for pneumonia, as the patient has increased secretions. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with additional free water. Pain control will be monitored as sedation is lessened. The patient is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary formula and has a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on respiratory support, which indicates ongoing respiratory failure. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and mechanics.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's increased secretions and positive culture results suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This can worsen the patient's respiratory status and potentially lead to sepsis.
3. Hypotension: Although the patient was able to we"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**5-/2176**], presented with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe (gallstone) pancreatitis with ARDS and
   pressor requirement.  Now off pressors > 24 hours.  Spiked fever
   overnight.
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   He met ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration
   event at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely
   from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis) which has been likely etiology of transient
   hypotension and hypoxia with movement.
   -- He remains at goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue
   current TV and rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then
   work  weaning down PEEP.
   -- Continue to diuresis down to CVP <5 to help fluid status, on lasix
   gtt currently with good urine output (was net out 1 L since -midnight)
   -- Attempt to wean sedation
   #) Fever: lowgrade temp to 101.1 overnight, had been running 100.6
   yesterday; unclear cause; no increase in WBC; has been on
   broad-spectrum abx; minimal c/f necrotizing pancreatitis given abd is
   soft.  Possibly a drug reaction, though no eos on CBC/diff
   -- will check urine eos
   -- will d/c abx given empiric w/o clear evidence of infection and
   concern that fevers may be a drug reaction.
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.   ERCP
   team aware of patients.
   -- t/c repeat abd imaging looking for necrotic pancreatitis if fever
   persists
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin
   since AM of [**12-25**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely
   secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement.
   Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing
   of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well
   as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities
   on transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during
   his stay.
   #) Hypernatremia: Na 150 on [**2176-12-27**] trending up, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W.
   -- will check in PM in setting of diuresis
    # Abdominal distension: Patient without bowel movement for last 24
   hrs, had previously had diarrhea. Continues to have diminished bowel
   sounds. Blood pressure has been good, and lactate had been normal, so
   less concern for mesenteric ischemia, but will need to remain mindful
   of this.  KUB yesterday read with no signs of obstruction but poor
   quality film.  Still with somewhat high [**Date Range **] output, bilious; concern by
   nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is coiled.
   -- will repeat KUB
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**6-2**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2175**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   # ARF: Cr improved to 1.3 and stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN secondary
   to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension,
   also with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient
   also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a
   possibility. Urine output has remained stable.
   -- cont following CR & UOP
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved.

   pneumonia, treated with levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for
   desaturation on the floor in setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Due to ARDS from aspiration event. His
   respiratory status is further comporomised by his recent MSSA
   pneumonia.
   - Remains intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings
   - secretions are increasing, repeat cultures
   - attempt to run dry with lasix gtt to minimize pulmonary capillary
   leaking
   - Continue to wean vent as tolerated with reducing FiO2 as tolerated
   and then weaning PEEP as tolerated.
   - continue nafcililn x 14 days from MSSA in sputum
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   - daily wake up, RSBI, VAP ppx
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  no evidence of sepsis, all cultures negative
   -  now off pressors, maintains good UOP with stable creatinine
   - attempt to minimize propofol
   - caution with lasix gtt

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status-post CABG, who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, and was found to have severe gallstone pancreatitis with ARDS and pressor requirement. The patient remains in the ICU for further management.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and now has ARDS. This is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and severe gallstone pancreatitis. The patient remains intubated and is being ventilated with ARDSNet settings.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to systemic response to ARDS, with possible superimposed effects of propofol for sedation. The patient is currently off pressors and maintains good urine output with stable creatinine.

3. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is being treated with nafcillin for 14 days. Surveillance blood cultures will be followed to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.

4. Sedation: The patient is currently on propofol for sedation, with a fentanyl patch. The plan is to attempt to wean sedation as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension.

5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, which is diet-controlled at"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**5-/2176**], presented with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe (gallstone) pancreatitis with ARDS and
   pressor requirement.  Now off pressors > 24 hours.  Spiked fever
   overnight.
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   He met ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration
   event at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely
   from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis) which has been likely etiology of transient
   hypotension and hypoxia with movement.
   -- He remains at goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue
   current TV and rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then
   work  weaning down PEEP.
   -- Continue to diuresis down to CVP <5 to help fluid status, on lasix
   gtt currently with good urine output (was net out 1 L since -midnight)
   -- Attempt to wean sedation
   #) Fever: lowgrade temp to 101.1 overnight, had been running 100.6
   yesterday; unclear cause; no increase in WBC; has been on
   broad-spectrum abx; minimal c/f necrotizing pancreatitis given abd is
   soft.  Possibly a drug reaction, though no eos on CBC/diff
   -- will check urine eos
   -- will d/c abx given empiric w/o clear evidence of infection and
   concern that fevers may be a drug reaction.
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.   ERCP
   team aware of patients.
   -- t/c repeat abd imaging looking for necrotic pancreatitis if fever
   persists
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin
   since AM of [**12-25**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely
   secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement.
   Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing
   of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well
   as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities
   on transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during
   his stay.
   #) Hypernatremia: Na 150 on [**2176-12-27**] trending up, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W.
   -- will check in PM in setting of diuresis
    # Abdominal distension: Patient without bowel movement for last 24
   hrs, had previously had diarrhea. Continues to have diminished bowel
   sounds. Blood pressure has been good, and lactate had been normal, so
   less concern for mesenteric ischemia, but will need to remain mindful
   of this.  KUB yesterday read with no signs of obstruction but poor
   quality film.  Still with somewhat high [**Date Range **] output, bilious; concern by
   nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is coiled.
   -- will repeat KUB
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**6-2**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2175**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   # ARF: Cr improved to 1.3 and stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN secondary
   to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension,
   also with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient
   also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a
   possibility. Urine output has remained stable.
   -- cont following CR & UOP
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M initially admitted to ICU with
   pneumonia, treated with levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for
   desaturation on the floor in setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Due to ARDS from aspiration event. His
   respiratory status is further comporomised by his recent MSSA
   pneumonia.
   - Remains intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings
   - secretions are increasing, repeat cultures
   - attempt to run dry with lasix gtt to minimize pulmonary capillary
   leaking
   - Continue to wean vent as tolerated with reducing FiO2 as tolerated
   and then weaning PEEP as tolerated.
   - continue nafcililn x 14 days from MSSA in sputum
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   - daily wake up, RSBI, VAP ppx
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  no evidence of sepsis, all cultures negative
   -  now off pressors, maintains good UOP with stable creatinine
   - attempt to minimize propofol
   - caution with lasix gtt
   .
   # MSSA Bacteremia
   -          f/u surveillance blood cultures
   -          continue naf x 14 days
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol, with fentanyl patch.
   - attempt to wean as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease and was admitted to the ICU for pancreatitis and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient developed ARDS and required mechanical ventilation. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, hypernatremia, abdominal distension, and leukocytosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is further compromised by recent MSSA pneumonia and ARDS. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure if the patient does not respond to ventilation settings or if there is a worsening of lung function.

2. Sepsis: Although cultures are negative, the patient's fever and hypotension could indicate an underlying infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent or manage sepsis.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is currently showing signs of acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels. Continued monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to systemic response to ARDS or the effect of propofol for sedation. Careful management of fluid balance and vasopressor support may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

5. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, and appropriate antibiotic therapy is necessary to treat the infection and prevent complications such"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**5-/2176**], presented with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe (gallstone) pancreatitis with ARDS and
   pressor requirement.  Now off pressors > 24 hours.  Spiked fever
   overnight.
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   He met ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration
   event at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely
   from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis) which has been likely etiology of transient
   hypotension and hypoxia with movement.
   -- He remains at goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue
   current TV and rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then
   work  weaning down PEEP.
   -- Continue to diuresis down to CVP <5 to help fluid status, on lasix
   gtt currently with good urine output (was net out 1 L since -midnight)
   -- Attempt to wean sedation
   #) Fever: lowgrade temp to 101.1 overnight, had been running 100.6
   yesterday; unclear cause; no increase in WBC; has been on
   broad-spectrum abx; minimal c/f necrotizing pancreatitis given abd is
   soft.  Possibly a drug reaction, though no eos on CBC/diff
   -- will check urine eos
   -- will d/c abx given empiric w/o clear evidence of infection and
   concern that fevers may be a drug reaction.
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.   ERCP
   team aware of patients.
   -- t/c repeat abd imaging looking for necrotic pancreatitis if fever
   persists
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin
   since AM of [**12-25**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely
   secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement.
   Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing
   of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well
   as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities
   on transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during
   his stay.
   #) Hypernatremia: Na 150 on [**2176-12-27**] trending up, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W.
   -- will check in PM in setting of diuresis
    # Abdominal distension: Patient without bowel movement for last 24
   hrs, had previously had diarrhea. Continues to have diminished bowel
   sounds. Blood pressure has been good, and lactate had been normal, so
   less concern for mesenteric ischemia, but will need to remain mindful
   of this.  KUB yesterday read with no signs of obstruction but poor
   quality film.  Still with somewhat high [**Date Range **] output, bilious; concern by
   nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is coiled.
   -- will repeat KUB
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**6-2**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2175**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   # ARF: Cr improved to 1.3 and stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN secondary
   to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension,
   also with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient
   also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a
   possibility. Urine output has remained stable.
   -- cont following CR & UOP
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M initially admitted to ICU with
   pneumonia, treated with levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for
   desaturation on the floor in setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Due to ARDS from aspiration event. His
   respiratory status is further comporomised by his recent MSSA
   pneumonia.
   - Remains intubated, continue ventilation with ARDSNet settings
   - secretions are increasing, repeat cultures
   - attempt to run dry with lasix gtt to minimize pulmonary capillary
   leaking
   - Continue to wean vent as tolerated with reducing FiO2 as tolerated
   and then weaning PEEP as tolerated.
   - continue nafcililn x 14 days from MSSA in sputum
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   - daily wake up, RSBI, VAP ppx
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  no evidence of sepsis, all cultures negative
   -  now off pressors, maintains good UOP with stable creatinine
   - attempt to minimize propofol
   - caution with lasix gtt
   .
   # MSSA Bacteremia
   -          f/u surveillance blood cultures
   -          continue naf x 14 days
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol, with fentanyl patch.
   - attempt to wean as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   .
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications
   .
   # Chronic pain:  Neuropathy
   - continue duragesic patches now.
   - avoid oversedation given borderline BP
   .
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - continue iron
   .
   # Asthma: PFTs in our system last from [**2168**] at which time they were
   normal.
   - continue home ipratropium prn; add albuterol prn
   .
   # BPH: Holding home finasteride.
   .
   # h/o HCV infection:
   - no active treatment

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status-post CABG, who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, and was found to have severe gallstone pancreatitis with ARDS and pressor requirement. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation, currently on ARDSNet settings. The patient's respiratory status is further compromised by recent MSSA pneumonia. The patient's fever is likely due to drug reaction or possible infection, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started empirically. The patient's pancreatitis is severe and acute, likely caused by gallstones, with minimal evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to significant third spacing of fluids in the abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as SIRS from his pancreatitis. The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to the inability to give oral water, insensible losses, and diuresis. The patient's abdominal distension may be secondary to bowel obstruction or decreased bowel movement, possibly due to ileus or other causes. The patient's leukocytosis has resolved. The patient's renal function is stable with an Hct of 28.1 and Cr of 0.6. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and he is on a cardiac, diabetic diet. The patient's chronic"

   tolerating PSV but requiring high PEEP.  Secretions are copious.
     -Will try to wean PEEP/FiO2 as able
     -Continue to diurese as able.  At present with CVP of 4, will likely
   have to run even.
     -Continue pulmonary toilet.
     -Advance ETT about 4cm.
    Hypotension:  Has been off pressors for about 24 hours.  CVP
   currrently 4.
      -Will monitor BP with continued diuresis
    Pneumonia:  Abx switched to Nafcillin yesterday given culture
   results.  Secretions are increased today.
      -Check sputum culture and continue nafcillin for now unless spikes
   fever.
    Hypernatremia:  Resolved with additional free water.
    Pain Control: Will monitor requirements as sedation is lessened.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. They have respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to aspiration, hypotension, and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 90/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 60%, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 132. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient has hypernatremia, which has resolved with additional free water. Imaging shows decreased effusion on the left side and the endotracheal tube placed 9 cm from the carina. Assessment and plan include continued pulmonary toilet, advancing ETT about 4 cm, weaning PEEP/FiO2 as able, and monitoring for hypotension and pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and copious secretions, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Barotrauma: The high levels of PEEP and positive pressure ventilation may cause barotrauma, leading to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion.
4. Infection: The presence of low-grade fever and increased secretions raises concern for a potential infection, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infection.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess of intake over output, indicating a potential fluid overload situation, which can lead to pulmonary edema or heart failure."

   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS secondary to witnessed aspiration.  Overall
   trend has been improvement in oxygenation and mechanics.  Currently
   tolerating PSV but requiring high PEEP.  Secretions are copious.
     -Will try to wean PEEP/FiO2 as able
     -Continue to diurese as able.  At present with CVP of 4, will likely
   have to run even.
     -Continue pulmonary toilet.
     -Advance ETT about 4cm.
    Hypotension:  Has been off pressors for about 24 hours.  CVP
   currrently 4.
      -Will monitor BP with continued diuresis
    Pneumonia:  Abx switched to Nafcillin yesterday given culture
   results.  Secretions are increased today.
      -Check sputum culture and continue nafcillin for now unless spikes
   fever.
    Hypernatremia:  Resolved with additional free water.
    Pain Control: Will monitor requirements as sedation is lessened.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have been experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to witnessed aspiration. There has been an overall improvement in oxygenation and mechanics, but the patient still requires high PEEP. Secretions are copious, so efforts will be made to wean PEEP/FiO2 as able, continue pulmonary toilet, advance ETT about 4cm, and diuresis.

The patient's blood pressure is stable, and they have been off pressors for about 24 hours with a current CVP of 4. Hypotension will be monitored with continued diuresis. The patient also has pneumonia, and the antibiotic regimen has been switched to Nafcillin based on culture results. Secretions are increased today, so sputum culture will be checked, and Nafcillin will continue unless there is a fever spike.

Hypernatremia has resolved with additional free water. Pain control will be monitored as sedation is lessened. The patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 40 mL/hour and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU. The patient's condition is critical."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who was initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He was treated with levaquin and later transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor due to an aspiration event. The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is currently intubated. He remains on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off as tolerated. The patient's respiratory status is further complicated by a recent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to a systemic response to ARDS and possible effects of propofol for sedation. His blood cultures are negative, indicating no evidence of sepsis. The patient is being managed with careful fluid balance and minimizing propofol use.

The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia, which is being treated with nafcillin for 14 days. He is also being monitored for sedation and his diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) is being managed with diet control and insulin sliding scale.

Other medical conditions include coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic pain with neuropathy, anemia, asthma, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and replete electrolytes.

The patient is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and has multiple lines inserted, including a multi-l"

   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M initially admitted to ICU with
   pneumonia, treated with levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for
   desaturation on the floor in setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Due to ARDS from aspiration event. His
   respiratory status is further comporomised by his recent MSSA pneumonia
   (cultures from [**12-20**]).
   - Remains intubated, was on ARDSNet settings, now PS
   - SBT today.  If fails, wean pressure support and peep
   - currently  lasix gtt off due to hypotension, but will try it back if
   able, to minimize pulmonary capillary leaking
   - continue nafcililn x 14 days from MSSA in sputum ([**12-20**])
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   - daily wake up, RSBI, VAP ppx
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  no evidence of sepsis, all cultures negative
   -  now off pressors, maintains good UOP with stable creatinine
   - attempt to minimize propofol
   - needed bolus overnight; hold lasix gtt while needing bolus
   # MSSA Bacteremia
   -  f/u surveillance blood cultures
   -  continue naf x 14 days
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol, with fentanyl patch.
   - attempt to wean as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications
   # Chronic pain:  Neuropathy
   - continue duragesic patches now.
   - avoid oversedation given borderline BP
   # Anemia:  stable
   - continue iron
   # Asthma: PFTs in our system last from [**2168**] at which time they were
   normal.
   - continue home ipratropium prn; add albuterol prn
   # BPH: Holding home finasteride while intubated
   # h/o HCV infection:
   - no active treatment

","The patient is a 68-year-old male who was initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, treated with levaquin, and then transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in the setting of aspiration. He developed ARDS. 

The patient remains intubated and is currently on pressure support (PS) mode. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. If the SBT fails, the pressure support and PEEP will be weaned. 

The patient is hypotensive, likely from a systemic response to ARDS, with possible superimposed effects of propofol for sedation. No evidence of sepsis is present, as all cultures are negative. 

The patient has MSSA bacteremia and will continue with nafcillin for 14 days. 

Sedation will be attempted to be weaned as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension. 

The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, controlled by diet at home, and will be on an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), with negative cardiac enzymes twice. He will continue with ASA and statin, but hold BP medications. 

The patient has chronic pain due to neuropathy and will continue with duragesic patches. 

The patient has stable anemia and will continue with iron supplementation. 

The patient has asthma, with normal PFTs from [**216"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU. They have been experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration, which has led to ARDS. The patient's oxygenation and mechanics are improving, and they are tolerating pressure support ventilation and PEEP/FiO2 requirements well. Secretions have reduced today. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but they are currently holding on diuretics due to low central venous pressure (CVP) and borderline mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient also has pneumonia, for which antibiotics have been switched to Nafcillin based on culture results. Secretions have improved today, and the patient will continue on Nafcillin unless they develop a fever. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with additional free water. Pain control will be monitored as sedation is reduced. The rest of the plan is according to the resident note. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU."

   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS secondary to witnessed aspiration.  Overall
   trend has been improvement in oxygenation and mechanics.  Currently
   tolerating PSV and PEEP/FiO2 requirements improving.  Secretions less
   today.
     -SBT today
     -Will try to wean PEEP/FiO2 as able
     -Holding on diuresis for now given low CVP's and borderline MAPS.
     -Continue pulmonary toilet.
    Hypotension:  Has been off pressors for about 24 hours.  CVP
   currrently [**4-30**].
     -Holding diuresis for now as above.
    Pneumonia:  Abx switched to Nafcillin given culture results.
   Secretions are improved today.
     -F/u sputum culture and continue nafcillin for now unless spikes
   fever.
    Hypernatremia:  Resolved with additional free water.
    Pain Control: Will monitor requirements as sedation is lessened.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history, allergies, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for some noted changes. The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation.

The patient experienced mild hypotension overnight, which responded to a fluid bolus. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, pain medications, and others. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, mild hypotension, and good oxygenation. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, and supplemental oxygen.

The patient's labs show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges, except for slightly elevated sodium levels. Imaging shows tubes and lines in place, with no significant changes in chest X-ray.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to witnessed aspiration. There has been an overall improvement in oxygenation and mechanics. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today, wean PEEP/FiO2 as able, continue pulmonary toilet, and hold on diuresis for now given low CVP's and borderline mean arterial pressures.

Other assessments and plans include hypotension, pneumonia, hypernatremia, and pain control. The patient's ICU"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male who was initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He was treated with levaquin and later transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor, resulting in an aspiration event and the development of ARDS. The patient remains intubated on pressure support (PS) and will undergo a repeat spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. If the SBT fails, the pressure support and PEEP will be weaned, and the patient will be restarted on lasix to maintain a urine output goal of -500cc to -1L. Nafcillin will continue to be administered for MSSA in the sputum for 14 days, and sputum cultures will be sent daily due to a low-grade temperature. The patient will receive daily wake-up calls, respiratory secretion management, and VAP prevention measures. 

The patient's hypotension is likely from the systemic response to ARDS and possible superimposed effects of propofol for sedation. There is no evidence of sepsis as all cultures are negative, and the patient is now off pressors, maintaining good urine output with stable creatinine levels. An attempt will be made to wean propofol.

MSSA bacteremia is being treated with nafcillin for 14 days, and surveillance blood cultures will be followed up. The patient's sedation will continue with propofol and fentanyl patch, with an attempt to wean as"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M initially admitted to ICU with pneumonia, treated with
   levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in
   setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Due to ARDS from aspiration event. His
   respiratory status is further comporomised by his recent MSSA pneumonia
   (cultures from [**12-20**]).
   - Remains intubated, was on ARDSNet settings, now PS
   - SBT today.  If fails, wean pressure support and peep
   - currently  lasix gtt off due to hypotension, but will try it back if
   able, to minimize pulmonary capillary leaking
   - continue nafcililn x 14 days from MSSA in sputum ([**12-20**])
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   - daily wake up, RSBI, VAP ppx
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  no evidence of sepsis, all cultures negative
   -  now off pressors, maintains good UOP with stable creatinine
   - attempt to minimize propofol
   - needed bolus overnight; hold lasix gtt while needing bolus
   # MSSA Bacteremia
   -  f/u surveillance blood cultures
   -  continue naf x 14 days
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol, with fentanyl patch.
   - attempt to wean as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications
   # Chronic pain:  Neuropathy
   - continue duragesic patches now.
   - avoid oversedation given borderline BP
   # Anemia:  stable
   - continue iron
   # Asthma: PFTs in our system last from [**2168**] at which time they were
   normal.
   - continue home ipratropium prn; add albuterol prn
   # BPH: Holding home finasteride while intubated
   # h/o HCV infection:
   - no active treatment

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 68-year-old male initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, treated with levaquin, and then transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in the setting of aspiration. The patient developed ARDS and has been intubated. His respiratory status remains compromised by recent MSSA pneumonia (cultures from 12/20). The patient underwent a spontaneous breathing trial today but became hypoxic to 88%, so he was placed back on pressure support. The plan is to continue weaning PS and PEEP if the patient tolerates it. The patient is currently on propofol for sedation, and attempts will be made to wean off it to avoid iatrogenic hypotension. 

The patient has several other medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, chronic pain due to neuropathy, anemia, asthma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, a history of hepatitis C infection, and replete electrolytes with tube feeds. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate is 94 bpm, blood pressure is 104/54 mmHg, respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 92% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 50, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 170. The patient's recent lab results show leukocyte count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, sodium of 135 mg/dL, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. The patient's imaging includes a chest X-ray from 12/30 showing slightly improved findings compared to previous days. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to ARDS and pneumonia, hypotension from systemic response to ARDS and possible superimposed effect of propofol for sedation, MSSA bacteremia, sedation-related complications, diabetes management, coronary artery disease management, chronic pain management, anemia management, asthma management, benign prostatic hyperplasia management, hepatitis C infection management, and electrolyte imbalance management."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) secondary to witnessed aspiration. The patient's respiratory status has shown improvement in oxygenation and mechanics but failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday. The plan is to perform another SBT today, and if the patient passes, extubation will be considered.

The patient also has hypotension and has been off pressors for about 48 hours. The current central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

Additionally, the patient has pneumonia and MSSA (Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) bacteremia. The antibiotic regimen has been switched to nafcillin based on culture results, and secretions have improved. It is planned to follow up with sputum culture and continue nafcillin unless fever spikes.

Regarding pain control, the plan is to monitor the patient's requirements as sedation is lessened. The rest of the plan is mentioned in the resident note.

In terms of ICU care, the patient will receive nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU."

   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS secondary to witnessed aspiration.  Overall
   trend has been improvement in oxygenation and mechanics.  Failed SBT
   yesterday. Currently tolerating minimal vent support.
     -SBT today.  If passes-->extubate
     -Will try to push diuresis by decreasing propfol
     -Continue pulmonary toilet.
    Hypotension:  Has been off pressors for about 48 hours.  CVP
   currrently [**4-30**].
    Pneumonia/MSSA Bacteremia:  Abx switched to Nafcillin given culture
   results.  Secretions are improved today.
     -F/u sputum culture and continue nafcillin for now unless spikes

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) secondary to witnessed aspiration. The patient's respiratory status has been improving, but they failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday due to desaturation. The plan is to attempt another SBT today, and if successful, the patient may be extubated. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and they have been off pressors for about 48 hours. The central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

The patient also has pneumonia/MSSA (Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) bacteremia, for which the antibiotic has been switched to Nafcillin based on culture results. Secretions have improved today.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being intubated for an extended period. The healthcare team is continuing pulmonary toilet to prevent this complication.

The patient's pain control needs will be monitored as sedation is reduced. The rest of the plan is documented in the resident note."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M initially admitted to ICU with pneumonia, treated with
   levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in
   setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Improving slowly although failed SBT last 2
   days.  Was due to ARDS from aspiration event as well as recent MSSA
   pneumonia (cultures positive from [**12-20**]). Sefl-extubated [**2176-12-30**], but
   re- intubated on ARDSNET protocol.
   - repeat SBT today.  If fails, wean pressure support and peep
   - would restart lasix gtt as opposed to bolus lasix  to goal -500cc to
   -1L today
   - continue nafcililn x 14 days from MSSA in sputum (12/26
 [**1-2**])
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   - daily wake up, RSBI, VAP ppx
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  no evidence of sepsis, all cultures negative
   -  was briefly on levophed with IV lasix, now off, maintains good UOP
   with stable creatinine
   - had to add fentanyl as on large dose of propofol
   # MSSA Bacteremia
   -  f/u surveillance blood cultures
   -  continue naf x 14 days (last day [**2177-1-2**])
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol, fentanyl gtt,  with fentanyl patch.
   - attempt to wean as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications
   # Chronic pain:  Neuropathy
   - continue duragesic patches now.
   - avoid oversedation given borderline BP
   # Anemia:  stable
   - continue iron
   # Asthma: PFTs in our system last from [**2168**] at which time they were
   normal.
   - continue home ipratropium prn; add albuterol prn
   # BPH: Holding home finasteride while intubated
   # h/o HCV infection:
   - no active treatment
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin.  On PPI as outpatient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He was treated with levaquin and then transferred back to the ICU due to desaturation on the floor, in the setting of aspiration. The patient developed ARDS and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has also developed MSSA pneumonia, which was positive in cultures from 12/20. The patient self-extubated on 12/30 but was re-intubated on the ARDSNET protocol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is improving slowly but he has failed spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for the past two days. This indicates ongoing respiratory failure due to ARDS from aspiration and recent MSSA pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension as a systemic response to ARDS, with possible superimposed effects of propofol for sedation. However, there is no evidence of sepsis as all cultures are negative.
3. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which requires continued surveillance blood cultures and antibiotic treatment with nafcillin for 14 days.
4. Sedation: The patient is currently on propofol and fentanyl gtt, with a fentanyl patch. There is a plan to wean sedation as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M initially admitted to ICU with pneumonia, treated with
   levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in
   setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Improving slowly although failed SBT last 2
   days.  Has low grade fever, rising WBC.   Was due to ARDS from
   aspiration event as well as recent MSSA pneumonia (cultures positive
   from [**12-20**]). Sefl-extubated [**2176-12-30**], but re- intubated on ARDSNET
   protocol.
   - repeat SBT today.  Extubate.
   - change ABX to vanco/zosyn given wbc and fever
   - I/O goal even, may need some lasix to achieve this
   - Gram Pos coverage for fMSSA in sputum and blood (12/26
 [**1-2**])
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  all cultures negative
   -  broaden coverage to vanco/zosyn for rising temp, leukocytosis
   -  was briefly on levophed with IV lasix, now off, maintains good UOP
   with stable creatinine
   -  cont fentanyl, wean once extubated
   # MSSA Bacteremia
   -  f/u surveillance blood cultures
   -  continue naf x 14 days (last day [**2177-1-2**])
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol, fentanyl gtt,  with fentanyl patch.
   - attempt to wean as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications
   # Chronic pain:  Neuropathy
   - continue duragesic patches now.
   - avoid oversedation given borderline BP
   # Anemia:  stable
   - continue iron
   # Asthma: PFTs in our system last from [**2168**] at which time they were
   normal.
   - continue home ipratropium prn; add albuterol prn
   # BPH: Holding home finasteride while intubated
   # h/o HCV infection:
   - no active treatment
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, tube feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, treated with levaquin, and later transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor due to aspiration. He developed ARDS and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial twice and self-extubated but was re-intubated on the ARDSNET protocol. He is currently on propofol and fentanyl for sedation, with a plan to wean off as tolerated. The patient has a rising white blood cell count and fever, indicating a possible infection. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia. Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, chronic pain with neuropathy, anemia, asthma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a history of HCV infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 99/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing due to ARDS. Continued support with mechanical ventilation and adherence to the ARDSNET protocol are necessary. Monitoring for improvement in oxygenation and lung function is essential.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia"

   pneumonia (cultures positive from [**12-20**]). Sefl-extubated [**2176-12-30**], but
   re- intubated on ARDSNET protocol.
   - repeat SBT today.  If fails, wean pressure support and peep
   - would restart lasix gtt as opposed to bolus lasix  to goal -500cc to
   -1L today
   - continue nafcililn x 14 days from MSSA in sputum (12/26
 [**1-2**])
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   - daily wake up, RSBI, VAP ppx
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  no evidence of sepsis, all cultures negative
   -  was briefly on levophed with IV lasix, now off, maintains good UOP
   with stable creatinine
   - had to add fentanyl as on large dose of propofol
   # MSSA Bacteremia
   -  f/u surveillance blood cultures
   -  continue naf x 14 days (last day [**2177-1-2**])
   #Sedation: Currently on propofol, fentanyl gtt,  with fentanyl patch.
   - attempt to wean as tolerated to avoid iatrogenic hypotension
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications
   # Chronic pain:  Neuropathy
   - continue duragesic patches now.
   - avoid oversedation given borderline BP
   # Anemia:  stable
   - continue iron
   # Asthma: PFTs in our system last from [**2168**] at which time they were
   normal.
   - continue home ipratropium prn; add albuterol prn
   # BPH: Holding home finasteride while intubated

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 68-year-old male who was initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and later transferred back due to desaturation on the floor following an aspiration event. He developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, chronic pain with neuropathy, anemia, asthma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a history of hepatitis C infection.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to ARDS and MSSA pneumonia, hypotension likely caused by systemic response to ARDS and possible superimposed effects of propofol for sedation, MSSA bacteremia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, chronic pain with neuropathy, anemia, asthma, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sepsis, further episodes of hypotension, infections related to indwelling lines or devices, and complications associated with diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic pain management."

   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS  secondary to witnessed aspiration.  Overall
   trend has been improvement in oxygenation and mechanics.  Failed SBT
   and subsequent self-extubation yesterday. Currently tolerating minimal
   vent support.  Given leukocytosis, and low grade fevers, ?concern for
   early VAP
     -SBT again today
     -Send sputum culture
     -Empiric Vanc/zosyn, if cultures negative at 48 hours-->d/c abx.
    Hypotension:  CVP 2, currently off pressors
      -Hold on diuresis.
      -Monitor BP off propofol.
    MSSA Bacteremia:  Will replace nafcillin with Vancomycin for now.
   Course to end [**2177-1-2**]
    Pain Control: Will monitor requirements as sedation is lessened.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of MSSA bacteremia and respiratory failure secondary to aspiration. The patient's condition has been improving in terms of oxygenation and mechanics, but they recently failed a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) and self-extubated. They were reintubated without difficulty. The patient's vital signs show a fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and altered liver function tests. Imaging reveals persistent bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's recent self-extubation and low-grade fevers, there is a concern for early VAP. The plan includes sending sputum culture and conducting another SBT.

2. Hypotension: The patient's CVP is low, indicating possible hypovolemia. Pressors were briefly required, suggesting that the patient's blood pressure is unstable. The plan involves holding diuretics and monitoring the patient's blood pressure off propofol.

3. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The plan is to replace nafcillin with vancomycin.

4. Pain control: As"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS  secondary to witnessed aspiration.  Overall
   trend has been improvement in oxygenation and mechanics.  Failed SBT
   yesterday. Currently tolerating minimal vent support.  Given
   leukocytosis, and low grade fevers, ?concern for early VAP
     -SBT again today
     -Send sputum culture
     -Empiric Vanc/zosyn, if cultures negative at 48 hours-->d/c abx.
    Hypotension:  CVP 2, currently off pressors
      -Hold on diuresis.
      -Monitor BP off propofol.
    MSSA Bacteremia:  Will replace nafcillin with Vancomycin for now.
   Course to end [**2177-1-2**]
    Pain Control: Will monitor requirements as sedation is lessened.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to aspiration. They have a history of MSSA bacteremia, and their current condition includes hypotension, possible early ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and pain control needs as sedation is reduced. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an increased respiratory rate. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis and low-grade fevers. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's medical history, allergies, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. The patient is well-nourished and attentive but sedated, with no acute distress observed. The patient's extremities are absent on the right side, and their skin has not been assessed. Imaging shows persistent bilateral infiltrates in the lungs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest a possible early VAP. Immediate actions should be taken to prevent further complications, such as sending sputum cultures and starting empiric antibiotics.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure and previous episodes of hypotension requiring pressors indicate a potential risk of organ hypoperfusion and inadequate tissue perfusion. Close monitoring and appropriate intervention, including"

   - I/O goal even, did get some lasix to help with resp status
   - Gram Pos coverage for MSSA in sputum and blood (12/26
 [**1-2**])
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  blood 1/6 with GPCs -- f/u speciation
   -  broadened coverage to vanco/zosyn for rising temp, leukocytosis--
   continue for now
   -  was briefly on levophed with IV lasix, now off, maintains good UOP
   with stable creatinine
   - hold lasix with goal I/O of even
   # MSSA Bacteremia
   -  repeat surveillance blood cultures given GPCs from [**2176-12-31**]
   -  continue abx coverage x 14 days(last day [**2177-1-2**]) unless something
   else grows
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and later transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor. He developed ARDS and was extubated on 12/31/2176. He appears more lethargic on 1/1/2177. The patient has multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, chronic pain due to neuropathy, anemia, asthma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a history of hepatitis C infection. He is currently receiving various medications and treatments for his conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously had respiratory failure due to ARDS and MSSA pneumonia. There is a potential for recurrent respiratory failure if the ARDS progresses or if there is a new respiratory infection.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which requires continued antibiotic coverage until resolution. There is a potential for worsening bacteremia if the current antibiotic regimen is ineffective.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive likely due to systemic response to ARDS. There is a potential for further hypotension if the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. Chronic Pain: The patient has chronic pain due to neuropathy, which may not be adequately managed with the current pain management plan.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, which may require ongoing monitoring and management.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes may be difficult to control during his ICU stay, especially considering the stress of illness and the need for insulin therapy.
7. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has CAD, and his condition may worsen during the ICU stay due to the stress of illness.
8. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The patient's BPH may cause urinary retention or other urinary symptoms during his ICU stay.
9. Hepatitis C Infection: The patient has a history of HCV infection, which may require ongoing monitoring and management.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization and bed rest.
11. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's history of mechanical ventilation, there is a potential risk for developing VAP."

   68 y/o M initially admitted to ICU with pneumonia, treated with
   levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in
   setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Was due to ARDS from aspiration event as well
   as recent MSSA pneumonia (cultures positive from [**12-20**]).  Extubated
   [**2176-12-31**]
   - Some hypoxia overnight, improved with face tent in addition to NC
   (6L)
   - Blood with GPC (1 of two); had changed nafcillin to Vanco/Zosyn
   [**2176-12-31**] -- continue broad coverage for now
   - I/O goal even, did get some lasix to help with resp status
   - Gram Pos coverage for MSSA in sputum and blood (12/26
 [**1-2**])
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   # Hypotension: Likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with possible
   superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   -  blood 1/6 with GPCs -- f/u speciation
   -  broadened coverage to vanco/zosyn for rising temp, leukocytosis--
   continue for now
   -  was briefly on levophed with IV lasix, now off, maintains good UOP
   with stable creatinine

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and later developed ARDS after an aspiration event. He was treated with antibiotics and eventually extubated. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to ARDS, hypotension, MSSA bacteremia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, chronic pain (neuropathy), anemia, asthma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, a history of HCV infection, replete electrolytes, and receiving tube feeds. The patient is on various medications including lasix, heparin, ppi, and insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure due to ARDS indicates a high risk for further respiratory complications.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The presence of MSSA bacteremia increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to systemic response to ARDS and possible superimposed effect of propofol for sedation. There is a risk of further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 which requires careful monitoring and management of blood glucose levels.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, and there is a risk of worsening cardiovascular status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to aspiration leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's recent events include extubation yesterday, ability to cough out secretions, some hypoxemia overnight requiring Lasix administration, delirium requiring low-dose Haldol, and vomiting this morning. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/71 to 139/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, crackles in bilateral lung fields, soft and non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 255 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 28 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, and glucose of 124 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated PT/PTT/INR"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M initially admitted to ICU with pneumonia, treated with
   levaquin, transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in
   setting of aspiration, developed ARDS.  Extubated [**2176-12-31**] without
   respiratory compromise since..
   # Respiratory Failure:  Resolved, with residual O2 requirement (4L) but
   no respiratory distress since extubation on [**2176-12-31**]. Was due to ARDS
   from aspiration event as well as recent MSSA pneumonia (cultures
   positive from [**12-20**]).
   - continue supplemental O2 as necessary for keeping sats >90%
   - aggressive pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry
   - strict NPO as failed S/S eval
   - I/O goal even to -500cc, lasix prn to help with resp status
   - [**12-24**] sputum cultures without pathogen
   # Positive Blood Cultures/ Bacteremia
 Blood with GPC (1 of two) from
   [**2176-12-31**]; had been receiving gram pos coverage for MSSA in sputum and
   blood with course of nafcillin planned from (12/26
 [**1-2**]), but changed
   nafcillin to Vanco/Zosyn [**2176-12-31**] as appeared worse, leukocytosis, low
   grade temp.
   - would re-narrow to nafcillin and continue coverage until surveillence
   cultures from [**1-1**] and [**1-2**] are negative x 72 hours
   - send surveillence cultures today, followup old cultures
   # Hypotension: Resolved, was likely from systemic resonse to ARDS, with
   possible superimposed effect of propofol for sedation.
   - no e/o sepsis as etiology, improved off of propfol
   - cautious lasix for repsiratory status
   # DM2:  Diet controlled per patient at home.  On sliding scale with
   FSG's<150
   - Insulin sliding scale while in house
   # CAD:  CE's negative x2
   - continue ASA, statin, hold BP Medications for now
   # Chronic pain:  Neuropathy
   - continue duragesic patches now.
   - hold neurontin
   # Anemia:  stable
   - continue iron
    # Asthma: PFTs in our system last from [**2168**] at which time they were
   normal.
   - continue home ipratropium prn, albuterol prn
   # BPH: Holding home finasteride while intubated

","The patient is a 68-year-old male who was initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He was treated with levaquin and then transferred back to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in the setting of aspiration. The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was extubated on December 31st without respiratory compromise since then. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure that has resolved but with residual oxygen requirement. He has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci (GPCs) from December 31st, and there are also positive sputum cultures showing budding yeast. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and Zosyn. Surveillance cultures are planned today, and the antibiotic regimen will be narrowed to nafcillin once these cultures are negative for 72 hours.

The patient also has hypotension that has resolved, likely due to systemic response to ARDS and possible superimposed effect of propofol for sedation. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is controlled by diet at home, and he is on an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital. Coronary artery disease is stable with negative cardiac enzymes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to aspiration, resulting in ARDS. The patient is currently intubated but has been extubated. He remains at high risk for aspiration. The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin. He also has positive blood cultures, possibly due to contamination, and will have follow-up survival cultures. The patient's pain is being managed with a fentanyl patch, and he is receiving tube feeds. His glycemic control is maintained with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has a history of allergies to lidocaine, unknown allergies, and various other medical conditions. His vital signs are stable, but he has low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 90%). The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating an ongoing infection. His blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk for aspiration is high due to his previous aspiration event leading to ARDS. This increases the likelihood of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia, which requires ongoing treatment with antibiotics such as vancomycin. If the infection spreads to other organs, it can lead to serious complications like sepsis.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is at high risk for aspiration and"

The patient has a history of allergies to Lidocaine, with the last dose taken on 2176-12-31 at 08:03 AM. The patient has also received antibiotics such as Nafcillin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.

The patient has undergone various procedures, including the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT), attempted swallow study, and insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (99%), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/54 to 118/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 83.3 kg, and their height is 70 inches.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for bibasilar crackles in the chest and absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities. The patient's neurological assessment reveals that they are attentive, follow simple commands, respond appropriately, and are oriented to place and person. However, movement, tone, and skin assessments are not evaluated.

Laboratory results indicate the following values: Hemoglobin - 8.8 g"
