 FEVER - 101.9
F - [**2191-11-28**] 10:00 AM
   - The patient's lovenox was stopped due to risk of bleeding given her
   Hct drop and guiaiac positive stools.  Heme/onc agreed with holding
   lovenox.  Also recommended giving neupogen.
   - She was given 2 units of PRBC in the am for Hct of 22.2 which did not
   bump appropriately to 2 units yesterday.  She was also started on a
   PPI.  Hct in the evening was 31.0 (from 22.2).
   - She was bolused with 1 L of LR for tachycardia in the am and 500 cc
   NS with K in the evening for continued tachycardia in the 120's to
   130's.  She did not appear responsive to IVF and her UOP increased with
   fluids.  A TSH was added on and she was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg
   qid (as she had been on atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient).  Her HR
   came down to the 110's overnight with the metoprolol.
   - C.diff and stool cx sent, C.diff neg, stool cx pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer with 4 days
   of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and neutropenic fever.
   # Neutropenic fever/sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   fever, leukopenia and respiratory rate. Likely source is GI given loss
   of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to tolerate PO.
   Patient was profoundly dehydrated with tachycardia, elevated lactate,
   all improved with aggressive hydration.  No fever since arrival to the
   floor.  Blood cultures sent, UA negative/ucx pending.  CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate and CT abd/pelvis negative for infection.
   Patient does have persistent fevers.  Consider other sources such as
   lungs possible.  C. Diff negative X 1.
   - Follow blood culture/urine culture.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Discuss with primary oncologist in am (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3782**]/covering fellow)
   - Continue to trend WBC, culture with spikes
   - F/U stool studies and C. Diff
   - Continue IVF given fever and dehydration, see below
   - Vanc/cefepime/flagyl for broad coverage including GI
   source/anaerobes, can narrow based on cultures and clinical source
   .
   # Pancytopenia: neutropenic, anemic and thrombocytopenic.  Likely from
   chronic illness as well as recent chemotherapy (12 days prior to
   admission).  Received 2 units PRBCs with several liters IVF on
   admission, HCT did not respond but may be dilutional effect as well.
   - transfuse additional 2 units with post-transfusion HCT later today
   - continue to monitor counts; neutropenic precautions
   - no active bleeding although is guaiac positive per ED report
   - consider Neupogen (will discuss with heme/onc today)
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Mostly resolved. Likely gastroenteritis,
   though given neutropenia, more concerning for occult cause.
   - NPO with ice chips for now
   - Advance to clears in am
   - Vanc/cefepime/flagyl as above
   - continue IVF
   - Zofran prn nausea
   - Send stool cultures/c.diff
   .
   # Metastatic Stage IV breast Ca: Now 12 days post cycle two of
   adriamycin/cytoxan.  Continuing to get XRT to back and leg, last [**10-18**].
   - Will touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3782**], primary onc in am.  Per OMR, appears
   next XRT is due in [**Month (only) **].
   .
   # Anxiety: Patient is quite tearful and anxious at this time.  Notes
   that she uses ativan at home for this prn.
   - Continue ativan prn
   - Consider SW consult in am
   .
   # Hx of DVT and recent portal vein thrombosis: On lovenox on outpatient
   but concerns with guaiac positive stool and thrombocytopenia
   - will hold Lovenox for now given concerns for bleeding risk, anemia
   and guaiac positive stool
   - will discuss further with heme/onc
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now with ice chips, advance to clears in am, replete
   lytes prn, IVF overnight
   .
   # Access: PIV, patient refused CVL
   .
   # PPx: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] start IV Pantoprazole given GI bleed and
   thrombocytopenia (although indications are for <50 platelets)

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer. She has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and neutropenic fever for the past four days. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to profound dehydration, tachycardia, elevated lactate, and respiratory rate. Blood cultures were sent, and urine culture is pending. The patient's fever has improved with aggressive hydration, but she still has persistent fevers. Other sources of infection such as the lungs are being considered. C. Diff is negative. 

Medical Complications:
1. Neutropenic fever/sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever, leukopenia, and respiratory rate. The likely source of infection is the gastrointestinal (GI) tract given her loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to tolerate oral intake.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient is neutropenic, anemic, and thrombocytopenic. This could be due to chronic illness and recent chemotherapy.
3. Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: The patient's symptoms are mostly resolved, but there is concern for an occult cause, especially considering her neutropenia.
4. Metastatic Stage IV breast cancer: The patient is currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
5. Anxiety: The patient is tearful and anxious, and she uses Ativan at home for anxiety.
6. History of DVT and recent portal vein thrombosis: The patient is currently on Lovenox, but concerns about bleeding risk, anemia, and guaiac positive stool have led to the decision to hold Lovenox for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, development of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, further deterioration of pancytopenia, complications related to metastatic breast cancer, and worsening anxiety."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer with 4 days
   of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and neutropenic fever.
   # Neutropenic fever/sepsis: On admission, met SIRS criteria with
   tachycardia, fever, leukopenia and respiratory rate. Likely source is
   GI given loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to
   tolerate PO. Patient was profoundly dehydrated with tachycardia,
   elevated lactate, all improved with aggressive hydration.  Blood
   cultures sent, UA negative/ucx pending.  CXR without evidence of
   infiltrate and CT abd/pelvis negative for infection.  C. Diff negative
   X 1.  Blood cx pending.  Fever to 100.4 this morning, cultures/
   - Follow blood culture/urine culture.
   - Neutropenic precautions, ANC 583 currently, goal >1000, on 7 day
   cours of neupogen
   - Discuss with primary oncologist in am (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3782**]/covering fellow)
   - Continue to trend WBC, culture with spikes
   - F/U stool studies and C. Diff
   - Continue IVF given fever and dehydration, see below
   - Vanc/cefepime/flagyl for broad coverage including GI
   source/anaerobes, can narrow based on cultures and clinical source
   # Pancytopenia: neutropenic, anemic and thrombocytopenic.  Likely from
   chronic illness as well as recent chemotherapy (12 days prior to
   admission).  Received 2 units PRBCs with several liters IVF on
   admission, HCT did not respond but may be dilutional effect as well,
   received an additional 2 units yesterday with hct to 31 and now stable
   this morning
   - pm hct to monitor for stability
   - continue to monitor counts; neutropenic precautions until ANC >1000
   (583 now)
   - no active bleeding although is guaiac positive per ED report
   - continue Neupogen per heme/onc recs
   - heme/onc following, appreciate recs
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Mostly resolved, no BM overnight. Likely
   gastroenteritis, though given neutropenia, more concerning for occult
   cause.
   - ADAT to clears

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of neutropenic fever, pancytopenia, and possible gastrointestinal infection. She is experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with a fever of 101.9°F. The patient's vital signs include tachycardia, elevated respiratory rate, and low blood pressure. She has received aggressive hydration, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and Neupogen to increase her white blood cell count. Her blood cultures, urinalysis, and stool cultures are pending. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis and recent portal vein thrombosis, for which she is on Lovenox. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances. She is currently receiving IV fluids, pantoprazole, and metoprolol. The patient's anxiety is also being addressed with the use of ativan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's neutropenic fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and positive guaiac test indicating possible GI bleeding, there is a risk of developing sepsis. Monitoring her vital signs and blood cultures is crucial.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets make her susceptible to infections, anemia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer with 4 days
   of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and neutropenic fever.
   # Neutropenic fever/sepsis: On admission, met SIRS criteria with
   tachycardia, fever, leukopenia and respiratory rate. Likely source is
   GI given loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to
   tolerate PO. Patient was profoundly dehydrated with tachycardia,
   elevated lactate, all improved with aggressive hydration.  Blood
   cultures sent, UA negative/ucx pending.  CXR without evidence of
   infiltrate and CT abd/pelvis negative for infection.  C. Diff negative
   X 1.  Blood cx pending.  Fever to 100.4 this morning, cultures/
   - Follow blood culture/urine culture.
   - Neutropenic precautions, ANC 583 currently, goal >1000, on 7 day
   cours of neupogen
   - Discuss with primary oncologist in am (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3782**]/covering fellow)

   - F/U stool studies and C. Diff
   - Continue IVF given fever and dehydration, see below
   - Vanc/cefepime/flagyl for broad coverage including GI
   source/anaerobes, can narrow based on cultures and clinical source
   # Pancytopenia: neutropenic, anemic and thrombocytopenic.  Likely from
   chronic illness as well as recent chemotherapy (12 days prior to
   admission).  Received 2 units PRBCs with several liters IVF on
   admission, HCT did not respond but may be dilutional effect as well,
   received an additional 2 units yesterday with hct to 31 and now stable

   gastroenteritis, though given neutropenia, more concerning for occult
   cause.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer. She presented with 4 days of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and neutropenic fever. She is currently in the ICU for severe dehydration and sepsis. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 120/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has pancytopenia, likely due to chronic illness and recent chemotherapy. Her hematocrit (Hct) has been fluctuating, with values ranging from 22.2% to 31.0%. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is on Neupogen to increase her absolute neutrophil count (ANC). She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and portal vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with neutropenic fever and sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and infection control measures are crucial to prevent further complications.

2. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and is guaiac positive, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis and suspected C. difficile infection. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, fever, and low blood pressure. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious but has clear oropharynx and normal cardiovascular findings. Lab results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactic acid levels. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and recent chemotx increases the risk of infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal. Close monitoring of vital signs, fever, and laboratory parameters is essential to identify early signs of infection.

2. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy (elevated PT/PTT) and positive guaiac-positive stools suggest a risk of bleeding. The decision to hold therapeutic anticoagulation should be closely monitored, as bleeding can be catastrophic in this patient.

3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level and GCSF administration indicate a need for red blood cell transfusions to maintain an adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count raises the risk of bleeding, particularly if invasive procedures are required. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and considering plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer with 4 days
   of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and neutropenic fever, now improving.
   # Neutropenic fever/sepsis: On admission, she met SIRS criteria with
   tachycardia, fever, leukopenia and respiratory rate. Likely source is
   GI given loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to
   tolerate PO. Patient was profoundly dehydrated with tachycardia,
   elevated lactate, all improved with aggressive hydration.  Blood
   cultures sent, UA negative/ucx no growht.  CXR without evidence of
   infiltrate and CT abd/pelvis negative for infection.  C. Diff negative
   X 1.  Blood cx pending.  Fever to 100.4 yesterday morning, improving
   clinically.
   - Follow blood culture/urine culture.
   - Neutropenic precautions DC
ed as her WBC increased from 1.1 to 5.1
   this mornin, goal >1000, on neupogen today
   - Discuss with primary oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3782**]/covering fellow)
   - Continue to trend WBC, culture with spikes
   - F/U stool studies and C. Diff
   - Continue IVF prn, will encourage po intake
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime/flagyl for broad coverage including GI
   source/anaerobes, can narrow based on cultures and clinical source
   - Asymptomatic hypotension was likely due to dehydration as she has not
   been eating, will give IVF prn.
   # Episode of A.fib yesterday: Patient has no history of a.fib, unclear
   what triggered this episode.  She responded to metoprolol and is
   currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg tid as her BP tolerates.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   # Pancytopenia: neutropenic, anemic and thrombocytopenic.  Likely from
   chronic illness as well as recent chemotherapy (12 days prior to
   admission).  Received 2 units PRBCs with several liters IVF on
   admission, HCT did not respond but may be dilutional effect as well,
   received an additional 2 units two days ago with hct to 31 and now
   stable this morning at 30.0.
   - daily Hct as has been stable recently
   - continue to monitor counts; neupogen today, reassess need tomorrow.
   - heme/onc following, appreciate recs
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Resolved. Likely gastroenteritis, though
   given neutropenia, more concerning for occult cause.
   - ADAT to full liquids
   - Vanc/cefepime/flagyl as above
   - continue IVF prn and encourage po intake
   - Zofran prn nausea
   - follow up stool cultures/c.dif
   # Metastatic Stage IV breast Ca: Now 13 days post cycle two of
   adriamycin/cytoxan.  Continuing to get XRT to back and leg, last [**10-18**].
   - Appreciate heme/onc following.  Per OMR, appears next XRT is due in

   53 year old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer with 4 days
   of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and neutropenic fever.
   # Neutropenic fever/sepsis: On admission, met SIRS criteria with
   tachycardia, fever, leukopenia and respiratory rate. Likely source is
   GI given loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to
   tolerate PO. Patient was profoundly dehydrated with tachycardia,
   elevated lactate, all improved with aggressive hydration.  Blood
   cultures sent, UA negative/ucx pending.  CXR without evidence of
   infiltrate and CT abd/pelvis negative for infection.  C. Diff negative
   X 1.  Blood cx pending.  Fever to 100.4 this morning, cultures/
   - Follow blood culture/urine culture.
   - Neutropenic precautions, ANC 583 currently, goal >1000, on 7 day
   cours of neupogen
   - Discuss with primary oncologist in am (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3782**]/covering fellow)
   - Continue to trend WBC, culture with spikes
   - F/U stool studies and C. Diff
   - Continue IVF given fever and dehydration, see below
   - Vanc/cefepime/flagyl for broad coverage including GI
   source/anaerobes, can narrow based on cultures and clinical source
   # Pancytopenia: neutropenic, anemic and thrombocytopenic.  Likely from
   chronic illness as well as recent chemotherapy (12 days prior to
   admission).  Received 2 units PRBCs with several liters IVF on
   admission, HCT did not respond but may be dilutional effect as well,
   received an additional 2 units yesterday with hct to 31 and now stable
   this morning
   - pm hct to monitor for stability
   - continue to monitor counts; neutropenic precautions until ANC >1000
   (583 now)
   - no active bleeding although is guaiac positive per ED report
   - continue Neupogen per heme/onc recs
   - heme/onc following, appreciate recs
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Mostly resolved, no BM overnight. Likely
   gastroenteritis, though given neutropenia, more concerning for occult
   cause.
   - ADAT to clears
   - Vanc/cefepime/flagyl as above until no longer neutropenic
   - continue IVF
   - Zofran prn nausea

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer. She presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and neutropenic fever. The patient was found to have pancytopenia, likely due to chronic illness and recent chemotherapy. She also had hypotension, hypokalemia, tachycardia, and an episode of asymptomatic hypotension.

The patient was treated with aggressive hydration, broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/cefepime/flagyl), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (Neupogen) to increase her neutrophil count. Blood cultures were sent, and urine culture is pending. The patient's fever resolved with aggressive hydration, and her lactate level improved.

The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with several liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) on admission. Her hematocrit (HCT) did not respond initially but stabilized after receiving an additional 2 units of PRBCs yesterday.

The patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea mostly resolved, but she remains at risk for an occult gastrointestinal infection. She will continue to receive IVF, and stool cultures will be followed up.

The patient has a history of metastatic stage IV breast cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She will be discussed with her primary oncologist today.

The patient expressed anxiety and tearfulness and has a history of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) and portal vein clot, currently admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis syndrome. The patient has been diagnosed with neutropenic fever, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB w/ RVR), sore throat, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, pancytopenia related to recent chemotherapy, and prior VTE with portal vein clot. The patient is also experiencing psychosocial issues including depression and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis syndrome: The patient's initial presentation of suspected sepsis syndrome indicates a severe systemic response to infection. It is crucial to closely monitor vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values to ensure early recognition and prompt management of any deterioration.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB w/ RVR): The patient's recent development of AFIB w/ RVR requires rate control and anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic complications. Frequent monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is necessary.
3. Neutropenic fever: As the patient is neutropenic, there is an increased risk of opportunistic infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy are essential.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia, likely related to recent chemotherapy, increases"
