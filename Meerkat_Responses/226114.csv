   infiltrates which may be underestimated in the setting of dehydration.

   weeks ago. Benign abd exam suggests against intra-abd process. MS
   appears near baseline making CNS infection less likely, although

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill, elderly man with a history of dementia and seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and fever. The patient has been experiencing hypotension in the 80s while sleeping, but it increases to the 100s when he awakens. He has an allergy to vancomycin and has been on multiple antibiotics, including linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/44 mmHg to 128/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi and wheezes in the left lung field, indicating possible pneumonia. There is also evidence of increased muscle tone, including in the neck. The patient has a mild erythema around the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube. Neurological examination shows minimal movement of the left lower extremity and no movement of the right lower extremity.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a chronically ill-appearing elderly man admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of fever, leukocystosis, and possible pneumonia. He also has hypernatremia, a seizure disorder, dementia, and a history of paroxysmal V-tach. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for various infections due to his compromised immune system and chronic illnesses. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and gastrointestinal (GI) infection. The presence of rhonchi on lung examination suggests possible aspiration pneumonia.

2. Delirium: The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and there are concerns about worsening MS likely due to infection/dehydration. Frequent reorientation and minimizing disruption to the sleep-wake cycle may be necessary to manage this.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

4. Seizure disorder: The patient has a chronic seizure disorder, and phenobarbital levels should be checked regularly to ensure appropriate management.

5. Dementia: The patient's dementia is worsening, and efforts should be made to minimize disruptions and provide appropriate care.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility. Prophylactic measures such as heparin"

   #. Fever, Leukocystosis. Aspiration PNA is most likely. Pt appears
   rhonchus on exam with witnessed poor secretion clearing with a history
   of aspiration PNA making this the most likely diagnosis. The CXR is
   fairly benign but there appears to be upper lobe infiltrates which may
   be underestimated in the setting of dehydration. Given history of
   pseudomonal and MSSA PNA and chronic nursing home resident will cover
   broadly for HAP. Flu is also possible in this living situation.
   However, currently no flu documented in Coolige House residents. Urine
   also posssble source of infection but UA may represent chronic
   colonization. The PEG tube site appears mildly erthyethmatous, it was
   replaced 2 weeks ago. Benign abd exam suggests against intra-abd
   process. MS appears near baseline making CNS infection less likely.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a chronically ill elderly man with multiple medical conditions and complications. The note highlights several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension with a blood pressure in the 80s while sleeping, which increased to the 100s upon awakening. This may indicate fluctuations in blood pressure and requires monitoring and management.

2. Allergy to Vancomycin: The patient has an allergy to Vancomycin, which is important to note when considering antibiotic treatment options.

3. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient appears to have aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by rhonchi on exam and a history of aspiration PNA. The CXR shows upper lobe infiltrates, suggesting possible HAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia). The patient is being covered broadly for HAP due to pseudomonal and MSSA PNA.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine may also be a source of infection, considering the positive UA and recent Foley catheterization. A urinary pathogen is being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has chronic hypernatremia, likely due to hypovolemia from infection and dementia. IVF (intravenous fluids) will be adjusted to correct this imbalance.

6. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is experiencing lactic acidosis, indicated by an"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a chronically ill-appearing elderly man who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of seizures since the age of 15 and is currently on phenobarbital. He also has dementia and is unable to speak in full sentences. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, particularly while sleeping, and his blood pressure has been ranging from the 80s to the 100s systolic.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and leukocystosis. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and gastrointestinal (GI) infection. Given the patient's history as a chronic nursing home resident and the presence of upper lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray, aspiration pneumonia is most likely. The patient's PEG tube site appears mildly erythematous, but there are no signs of intra-abdominal processes.

The patient's urine test shows positive results, which could indicate a source of infection or chronic colonization. He has a Foley catheter in place for urinary retention, which has been present for approximately 3 weeks. Cultures are being followed up, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover both resistant Gram-negative and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

   #. Fever, Leukocystosis. Aspiration PNA is most likely. Pt appears
   rhonchus on exam with witnessed poor secretion clearing with a history
   of aspiration PNA making this the most likely diagnosis. The CXR is
   fairly benign but there appears to be upper lobe infiltrates which may
   be underestimated in the setting of dehydration. Given history of
   pseudomonal and MSSA PNA and chronic nursing home resident will cover
   broadly for HAP. Flu is also possible in this living situation.
   However, currently no flu documented in Coolige House residents. Urine
   also posssble source of infection but UA may represent chronic
   colonization. The PEG tube site appears mildly erthyethmatous, it was
   replaced 2 weeks ago. Benign abd exam suggests against intra-abd
   process. MS appears near baseline making CNS infection less likely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 83-year-old chronically ill white male with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. He was admitted to the ICU due to suspected aspiration pneumonia (PNA), which is likely given his poor secretion clearing and history of previous aspiration PNA. The patient is rhonchous on examination, and upper lobe infiltrates are seen on the chest X-ray, although they may be underestimated due to dehydration. 

The patient has an allergy to vancomycin and has received various antibiotics including linezolid, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover both pseudomonal and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections. 

The patient's urine output has been low, and he has a Foley catheter in place for urinary retention lasting about 3 weeks. There is a suspicion that the Foley catheter may be a source of infection, so it will be replaced. 

The patient also has hypernatremia, likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia caused by infection and dementia. His sodium levels are elevated but have improved from baseline in the low 140s. 

Anion gap metabolic acidosis is present, likely due to lactic acidosis. 

The patient has a history of seizures since age 15 and is chronically on phenobarb"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yom advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration PNA, and recurrent UTIs
   presents with fever and increasing respiratory distress.
   SEPSIS -- Initially attributed to urinary source.  However, CXR
   demonstrates evolving  infiltrates of LUL > RUL fields (high risk for
   aspiration, with altered mental status and absence gag).  Also consider
   PEG tube site infecton.  Responded to current level of support.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- evolved since admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] reflect
   ""blossoming"" of pneumonia in the context of dehydration and with
   resussitation of fluids.  Suspect pneumonia, aspiration.  Also consider
   viral (influenza).  Plan continue antimicrobials.  Await culture
   results, respiratory and urinary antigens.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- reportedly with baseline of non-communicative
   to poorly communicative (reportedly able to answer with ""yes"" or
   ""no"").  Worsening currently may be due in part to infection/sepsis
   (toxic-metabolic), hypernatremia.  Consider possibility of post-ictal,
   but no obvious seizure activity noted.  Doubt meningitis or
   encephalitis.  Would d/c scopalamine patch.   Monitor mental status.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  Consider
   component of adrenal insufficiency.  Improved with iv fluids.  Monitor
   BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg
   RENAL FUNCTION -- insufficiency attributed to pre-renal state
   (hypovolemia, sepsis).  Improved.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Continue net fluid resussitation.  Currently
   peripheral iv's.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- recurrent, attributed to relative free water loss.
   Replete free water (based on free water deficit), monitor Na.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- attributed to sepsis, hypoperfusion.  Monitor
   lactcate during ressussitation.
   h/o SEIZURE DISORDER -- no apparent active disease.  Continue
   anticonvulsant (phenobarbitol), check level.  Consider EEG if fails to
   return to baseline mental status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He presents with fever and increasing respiratory distress. The initial diagnosis was sepsis attributed to a urinary source. However, further evaluation revealed evolving pulmonary infiltrates in the left upper lobe, which are suggestive of pneumonia and aspiration. The patient also has altered mental status, which may be due to infection/sepsis, hypernatremia, or post-ictal state. His hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis, but has improved with intravenous fluids. The patient's renal function is insufficiency, likely due to a pre-renal state. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing, and the patient's hypernatremia is being addressed by repleting free water. Lactic acidosis is attributed to sepsis and hypoperfusion. The patient has a history of seizure disorder, but no apparent active disease at present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory distress suggest a possible pneumonia. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, cough, and fever.
2. Aspiration: The patient's high risk for aspiration due to altered mental status and absence of gag reflex increases the likelihood of aspirating food or liquids into the lungs. Aspiration can cause respiratory distress, pneumonia, and even respiratory failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly man with a chronic illness who was admitted to the ICU due to an infection. The patient has multiple medical conditions including dementia, seizure disorder, and a history of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 118/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi in the lungs, no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds, and increased tone in all four extremities. The patient has a midline placed central venous catheter that is leaking and lost peripheral access. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (17.0 K/uL), low hemoglobin (10.1 g/dL), high blood glucose levels (195 mg/dL), and elevated lactate levels (3.4 mmol/L). The patient's urine output has been low.

Assessment and Plan:

1. The patient has fever and leukocytosis, suggesting an infection. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and gastrointestinal (GI) infection. Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely given the patient's history and examination findings.
2. The patient has hypernatremia, which has resolved. Free water flush"

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill elderly man who is currently in the ICU. He has a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and paroxysmal V-tach. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events are not specified in the note. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics due to concerns of pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and gastrointestinal tube infection. His vital signs are stable, but he has an elevated white blood cell count and lactate level indicating possible infection. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi and transmitted upper airway sounds, suggesting a respiratory issue. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there are no signs of extremity edema or calf pain. The patient's neurologic examination is difficult to assess due to his low baseline. The patient has a midline placed but leaking, and peripheral access has been lost. The patient's labs indicate potential electrolyte imbalances and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's diagnosis includes fever, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and possible pneumonia. The treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, respiratory support, and aggressive fluid management. The patient is also being closely monitored for complications such as delirium, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for now.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic illness, dementia, seizure disorder, and paroxysmal V-tach. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient's chief complaint is difficulty in breathing. 

Upon admission, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, and linezolid) to cover possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), pseudomonal infection, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection. However, the patient has an allergy to vancomycin, so linezolid was chosen instead.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 118/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool face tent with supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

The physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi and transmitted upper airway sounds, indicating possible respiratory infection. The patient also has increased tone in all four extremities and spontaneous movement of upper extremities. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 203 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels of 3.4 mmol/L, suggesting possible tissue hypoperfusion. The blood cultures are positive for multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora.

The patient's medical history includes a seizure disorder since age 15, chronic nursing home residence, dementia, and paroxysmal V-tach. The patient is currently on phenobarbital for seizure control and has a history of allergies to vancomycin.

The patient's current plan includes the continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics (zosyn and ciprofloxacin) to cover resistant Gram-negative infections, albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed for respiratory support, consideration of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) if group of polymicrobial pathogens are staphylococci, replacement of the PEG tube due to mild erythema at the insertion site, and trend of WBC and lactate levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), gastrointestinal infection, central nervous system (CNS) infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hypernatremia."

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill elderly man who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and gastrointestinal infection. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. He is on mechanical ventilation and receiving IV fluids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is likely due to aspiration given his history. There is also a suspicion of urinary tract infection, but it may represent chronic colonization rather than an active infection. The presence of fever and leukocytosis indicates ongoing inflammation or infection.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which has resolved. It should be monitored and managed with free water flushes to maintain hydration.
3. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder since the age of 15 and is currently on phenobarbital. It is important to continue this medication.
4. Dementia: The patient has dementia, as indicated by his brother's report. It is necessary to provide frequent reorientation and minimize disruptions to his sleep-wake cycle. Avoiding anticholinergics can also help manage his cognitive symptoms.
5. History of Paroxysmal Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's history of V-tach should be monitored closely in the ICU setting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of chronic illness, dementia, and seizure disorder, currently admitted to the ICU. He has been experiencing fever, leukocytosis, and possible pneumonia. He also has hypernatremia and is being treated with IV fluids. The patient has an allergy to vancomycin and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential resistant Gram-negative infection. He is also being treated for urinary tract infection, with a Foley catheter placed three weeks ago. The patient's mental status has worsened due to infection and dehydration. He is on phenobarbital for seizure disorder and is being monitored closely. The patient has a history of paroxysmal V-tach and is being monitored on telemetry. He has a DNR code status and is receiving various prophylactic treatments including bowel regimen, pain management, and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications due to pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis or septic shock due to infection, which can cause organ dysfunction.
3. Hypernatremia, which may lead to neurological complications if not managed properly.
4. Delirium or worsening mental status due to infection, dehydration, or other factors.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility.
6. Medication interactions or side effects, especially with multiple medications being"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yom advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration PNA, and recurrent UTIs
   presents with fever and increasing respiratory distress.
   SEPSIS -- Possible urinary source (GNR), although concern remains for
   pneumonia ( infiltrates of LUL > RUL fields --> high risk for
   aspiration, with altered mental status and absence gag).  Also consider
   PEG tube site infecton.  Responded to current level of support.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- evolved since admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] reflect
   ""blossoming"" of pneumonia in the context of dehydration and with
   resussitation of fluids.  Suspect pneumonia, aspiration.  Also consider
   viral (influenza).  Plan continue antimicrobials.  Await culture
   results, respiratory and urinary antigens.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- reportedly with baseline of non-communicative
   to poorly communicative (reportedly able to answer with ""yes"" or
   ""no"").  Worsening currently may be due in part to infection/sepsis
   (toxic-metabolic), hypernatremia.  Consider possibility of post-ictal,
   but no obvious seizure activity noted.  Doubt meningitis or
   encephalitis.  Would d/c scopalamine patch.   Monitor mental status.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  Consider
   component of adrenal insufficiency.  Improved with iv fluids.  Monitor
   BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg
   RENAL FUNCTION -- insufficiency attributed to pre-renal state
   (hypovolemia, sepsis).  Improved.
   ELEVATED CPK
 monitor serial CPK, recheck LFTs, cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Continue net fluid resussitation.  Currently
   peripheral iv's.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- recurrent, attributed to relative free water loss.
   Replete free water (based on free water deficit), monitor Na.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- attributed to sepsis, hypoperfusion.  Monitor
   lactcate during ressussitation.  Improving.
   h/o SEIZURE DISORDER -- no apparent active disease.  Continue
   anticonvulsant (phenobarbitol), check level.  Consider EEG if fails to
   return to baseline mental status.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He presents with fever and increasing respiratory distress, indicating a possible urinary source of infection (GNR) and concern for pneumonia (infiltrates of LUL > RUL fields --> high risk for aspiration). The patient also has a PEG tube site infection. The patient's altered mental status may be due to infection/sepsis, hypernatremia, or post-ictal state. Hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis, potentially with component of adrenal insufficiency. The patient's renal function is improving, but there is elevated CPK, hypernatremia, lactic acidosis, and a history of seizure disorder. The patient is critically ill and has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and infiltrates suggest pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is a concern given the patient's altered mental status and absence of gag reflex.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, altered mental status, and laboratory findings indicate sepsis. The source of infection appears to be urinary (GNR) but could also involve the PEG tube site.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels may contribute to altered mental status and require careful monitoring and treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yom advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration PNA, and recurrent UTIs
   presents with fever and increasing respiratory distress.
   SEPSIS -- Possible urinary source (GNR), although concern remains for
   pneumonia ( infiltrates of LUL > RUL fields --> high risk for
   aspiration, with altered mental status and absence gag).  Also consider
   PEG tube site infecton.  Responded to current level of support.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- evolved since admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] reflect
   ""blossoming"" of pneumonia in the context of dehydration and with
   resussitation of fluids.  Suspect pneumonia, aspiration.  Also consider
   viral (influenza).  Plan continue antimicrobials.  Await culture
   results, respiratory and urinary antigens.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- reportedly with baseline of non-communicative
   to poorly communicative (reportedly able to answer with ""yes"" or
   ""no"").  Worsening currently may be due in part to infection/sepsis
   (toxic-metabolic), hypernatremia.  Consider possibility of post-ictal,
   but no obvious seizure activity noted.  Doubt meningitis or
   encephalitis.  Would d/c scopalamine patch.   Monitor mental status.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  Consider
   component of adrenal insufficiency.  Improved with iv fluids.  Monitor
   BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg
   RENAL FUNCTION -- insufficiency attributed to pre-renal state
   (hypovolemia, sepsis).  Improved.
   ELEVATED CPK
 monitor serial CPK, recheck LFTs, cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Continue net fluid resussitation.  Currently
   peripheral iv's.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- recurrent, attributed to relative free water loss.
   Replete free water (based on free water deficit), monitor Na.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- attributed to sepsis, hypoperfusion.  Monitor
   lactcate during ressussitation.  Improving.
   h/o SEIZURE DISORDER -- no apparent active disease.  Continue
   anticonvulsant (phenobarbitol), check level.  Consider EEG if fails to
   return to baseline mental status.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He presents with fever and increasing respiratory distress. The assessment includes possible urinary source (GNR), concern for pneumonia (infiltrates of LUL > RUL fields), and potential PEG tube site infection. The patient responded to the current level of support.

The patient's pulmonary infiltrates have evolved since admission, and there is suspicion of pneumonia and aspiration. Viral etiology, such as influenza, is also considered. The plan includes continuing antimicrobials, awaiting culture results, respiratory and urinary antigens.

The patient's altered mental status is reportedly worsening, which may be due to infection/sepsis (toxic-metabolic) or hypernatremia. The possibility of post-ictal state is considered, but no obvious seizure activity was noted. Meningitis or encephalitis is unlikely, and the scopalamine patch should be discontinued. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored.

Hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis. The consideration of component of adrenal insufficiency is mentioned, but it improved with iv fluids. The patient's blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be closely monitored, maintaining MAP > 60 mmHg.

Renal function insufficiency is attributed to a pre-renal state (hypovolemia, sepsis). This has improved. Serial CP"

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Fever, Leukocystosis. Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia,
   UTI, G-tube infection. Aspiration PNA most likely given patient
   history. Pt appears rhonchorous on exam with witnessed poor secretion
   clearing. The CXR is fairly benign but there appears to be upper lobe
   infiltrates which may be underestimated in the setting of dehydration.
   Given history of pseudomonal and MSSA PNA and chronic nursing home
   resident covering broadly for HAP. Influenza negative. Urine also
   posssble source of infection but UA may represent chronic colonization.
   The PEG tube site appears mildly erthyethmatous, it was replaced 2
   weeks ago. Benign abd exam suggests against intra-abd process. MS
   appears near baseline making CNS infection less likely, although
   difficult to perform neurologic exam given patient
s low baseline.
   Urine legionella antigen negative. Sputum gram stain with 4+, multiple
   organisms, consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Had  Foley x 3 weeks
   (placed for urinary retention), changed on admission.
   - Linezolid (allergy to vanco), zosyn, and Cipro (to double cover
   resistent Gram neg infection)
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs PRN
   - f/u sputum, urine, blood cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 83-year-old male with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, hypernatremia, and paroxysmal V-tach. He is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a central line infection and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. He also has a PEG tube site infection and chronic urinary retention. His MS is worsening, and he is disoriented. The patient's condition appears to be improving with decreased lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk factors for aspiration include dementia, poor secretion clearance, and being a nursing home resident. Upper lobe infiltrates seen on the CXR may indicate pneumonia.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has a PICC line inserted, and there is a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which could indicate a central line infection.
3. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): The patient has a Foley catheter in place for urinary retention, and there is a positive urine culture with mixed fecal flora, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and the risk of developing VAP is increased. The patient's clinical presentation and sputum culture results are suggestive of pneumonia.
5. Pressure injuries: The patient's immobility and decreased tissue perfusion"

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Fever, Leukocystosis. Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia,
   UTI, G-tube infection. Aspiration PNA most likely given patient
   history. Pt appears rhonchorous on exam with witnessed poor secretion
   clearing. The CXR is fairly benign but there appears to be upper lobe
   infiltrates which may be underestimated in the setting of dehydration.
   Given history of pseudomonal and MSSA PNA and chronic nursing home
   resident covering broadly for HAP. Influenza negative. Urine also
   posssble source of infection but UA may represent chronic colonization.
   The PEG tube site appears mildly erthyethmatous, it was replaced 2
   weeks ago. Benign abd exam suggests against intra-abd process. MS
   appears near baseline making CNS infection less likely, although
   difficult to perform neurologic exam given patient
s low baseline.
   Urine legionella antigen negative. Sputum gram stain with 4+, multiple
   organisms, consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Had  Foley x 3 weeks
   (placed for urinary retention), changed on admission.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and paroxysmal V-tach. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues.

1. Fever, leukocytosis, and rhonchi on auscultation suggest a possible pneumonia. The patient's history of chronic nursing home residence and aspiration pneumonia makes this a likely diagnosis. Upper lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray support this suspicion.

2. Urine culture results are inconclusive due to contamination with mixed fecal flora. However, the presence of gram-negative rods suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

3. Blood cultures have grown coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may indicate a catheter-related bloodstream infection.

4. The patient's PEG tube site appears mildly erythematous, raising concerns for local infection.

5. The patient has hypernatremia, which has resolved. Close monitoring of serum sodium levels is necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.

6. The patient has a history of seizures and is on chronic phenobarbital therapy.

7. The patient's cognitive status is worsening, likely due to infection and dehydration.

8. The patient has a history of paroxysmal V-tach and requires ongoing cardiac monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yom advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration PNA, and recurrent UTIs
   presents with fever and increasing respiratory distress.
   SEPSIS -- Improved.  Possible urinary source (GNR), although concern
   remains for pneumonia ( infiltrates of LUL > RUL fields --> high risk
   for aspiration, with altered mental status and absence gag).  Also
   consider PEG tube site infecton.  Responded to current level of
   support.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- evolved since admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] reflect
   ""blossoming"" of pneumonia in the context of dehydration and with
   resussitation of fluids.  Suspect pneumonia, aspiration.  Also consider
   viral (influenza).  Plan continue antimicrobials.  Await culture
   results, respiratory and urinary antigens.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Much improved since admission.  Reportedly
   with baseline of non-communicative to poorly communicative (reportedly
   able to answer with ""yes"" or ""no"").  Worsening currently may be due in
   part to infection/sepsis (toxic-metabolic), hypernatremia.  Consider
   possibility of post-ictal, but no obvious seizure activity noted.
   Doubt meningitis or encephalitis.  Would d/c scopalamine patch.
   Monitor mental status.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Await speciation.  Continue antimicrobials.
   Consider cardiac echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  Consider
   component of adrenal insufficiency.  Improved with iv fluids.  Monitor
   BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg
   RENAL FUNCTION -- insufficiency attributed to pre-renal state
   (hypovolemia, sepsis).  Improved.
   ELEVATED CPK
 monitor serial CPK, recheck LFTs, cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Continue net fluid resussitation.  Currently
   peripheral iv's.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- recurrent, attributed to relative free water loss.
   Replete free water (based on free water deficit), monitor Na.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- attributed to sepsis, hypoperfusion.   Resolved.
   h/o SEIZURE DISORDER -- no apparent active disease.  Continue
   anticonvulsant (phenobarbitol), check level.  Consider EEG if fails to
   return to baseline mental status.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with advanced dementia who has been admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient's current medical conditions include recurrent aspiration pneumonia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and possible pneumonia with left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrates. The patient's mental status has improved since admission but is currently worsening, which may be due to infection/sepsis, hypernatremia, or post-ictal state. Other issues mentioned in the note include bacteremia with GPC, hypotension attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis, renal insufficiency due to pre-renal state, elevated CPK, fluid resuscitation, hypernatremia, lactic acidosis resolved, seizure disorder, and nutritional support through tube feeds.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has recurrent aspiration pneumonia and possible pneumonia with LUL infiltrates. Complications of pneumonia can include respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. UTI: The patient has recurrent UTIs, which can lead to urinary tract obstruction, kidney damage, or sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, which can progress to septic shock and multi-organ failure.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has recurrent hypernatremia, which can cause neurological complications such as seizures"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yom advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration PNA, and recurrent UTIs
   presents with fever and increasing respiratory distress.
   SEPSIS -- Improved.   Bacteremia, and possible urinary source (GNR),
   although concern remains for pneumonia ( infiltrates of LUL > RUL
   fields --> high risk for aspiration, with altered mental status and
   absence gag).  Also consider PEG tube site infecton.  Responded to
   current level of support.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- evolved since admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] reflect
   ""blossoming"" of pneumonia in the context of dehydration and with
   resussitation of fluids.  Suspect pneumonia, aspiration.  No evidence
   for influenza.  Plan continue antimicrobials.  Await culture results,
   respiratory and urinary antigens.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Much improved since admission.  Reportedly
   with baseline of non-communicative to poorly communicative (reportedly
   able to answer with ""yes"" or ""no"").  Worsening currently may be due in
   part to infection/sepsis (toxic-metabolic), hypernatremia.  Consider
   possibility of post-ictal, but no obvious seizure activity noted.
   Doubt meningitis or encephalitis.  Would d/c scopalamine patch.
   Monitor mental status.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Await speciation.  Continue antimicrobials.
   Consider cardiac echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  Consider
   component of adrenal insufficiency.  Improved with iv fluids.  Monitor
   BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg
   RENAL FUNCTION -- insufficiency attributed to pre-renal state
   (hypovolemia, sepsis).  Improved.
   ELEVATED CPK
 monitor serial CPK, recheck LFTs, cardiac enzymes.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Continue net fluid resussitation.  Currently
   peripheral iv's.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- recurrent, attributed to relative free water loss.
   Replete free water (based on free water deficit), monitor Na.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- attributed to sepsis, hypoperfusion.   Resolved.
   h/o SEIZURE DISORDER -- no apparent active disease.  Continue
   anticonvulsant (phenobarbitol), check level.  Consider EEG if fails to
   return to baseline mental status.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He presented with fever and increasing respiratory distress. The patient's mental status has improved since admission, but there are concerns for possible infection or sepsis, hypernatremia, and post-ictal state. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Bacteremia with gram-positive cocci is also present. The patient's renal function is insufficient due to a pre-renal state. Other issues include hypotension, elevated CPK levels, hypernatremia, lactic acidosis, and a history of seizure disorder. The patient's fluid status is being managed, and nutritional support is provided through tube feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates and is at risk for developing pneumonia due to recurrent aspiration.
2. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of sepsis, including fever, increased respiratory distress, and bacteremia with gram-positive cocci.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function is insufficient, likely due to a pre-renal state caused by hypovolemia and sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has recurrent hypernatremia, possibly due"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of seizure disorder since the age of 15 and is chronically on Phenobarbital.
- They also have dementia and have shown improvement in their mental status, possibly due to infection/dehydration, but still disoriented.
- The patient was diagnosed with sepsis, most likely aspiration pneumonia, and is being treated with Linezolid and Zosyn. There is a possibility of a urinary tract infection as well.
- The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection. They have been afebrile for the past 24 hours.
- The patient has bacteremia with coag-neg staph in their blood cultures, which could be contamination or a possible infection.
- The patient had hypernatremia but has since resolved with intravenous fluids.
- There are concerns about elevated CK levels, which may be related to muscle damage or other factors.
- The patient has right and left lower extremity edema.
- They are receiving nutrition through a fiber source and their glycemic control is managed with regular insulin sliding scale.
