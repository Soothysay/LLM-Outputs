","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and hemorrhagic stroke. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 12 cmH2O, RR (set) of 22, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 97%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 124/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of +68 mL since 12 AM. The patient's blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count, glucose level, and troponin T level, as well as abnormal liver enzymes and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic examination, and many other assessments have not been evaluated. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including prophylactic heparin, acyclovir, and propofol. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, respiratory failure, and hemorrhagic stroke."

   MRI Brain: Findings most consistent with chronic small vessel
   infarction, without characteristic signal pattern suggestive of herpes
   encephalitis. Nevertheless, if this diagnosis is suspected clinically,
   presumably, the patient is already receiving prophylactic acyclovir.
   ADDENDUM AND COMMENT: There is mild high T2 signal within the mastoid
   sinus complexes as well, likely indicating an ongoing inflammatory
   process as well. Finally, regarding the exclusion of acute subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, a CT scan is far more effective than an MRI in addressing
   this issue. In that regard, a CT scan was performed yesterday and did
   not appear to disclose subarachnoid blood at that time. Also, a CT
   angiogram, obtained yesterday as well, is quite useful in the exclusion
   of an aneurysm involving the circle of [**Location (un) 4456**] and major vascular
   tributaries.
   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, presenting with lethargy and sleepiness,
   now admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and ?abnormal head
   CT.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Clearly hypoventilatory at baseline
   given high bicarb on initial chems, but with acute component as well.
   Unclear etiology of chronic componenet - no history of COPD though long
   smoking history.  [**Month (only) 51**] be OHS.  Acute component - ?cause or effect of
   altered mental status and lethargy.  No sedating meds known.
   - Continue vent at current settings; goal pCo2 in mid-high 60s with pH
   in low-mid 7.3 range.
   - No e/o RAD on exam; hold steroids for now; BDs prn.
   - Treatment of pneumonia as below.
   - Eval of cardiac function.
   - Workup of lethargy/altered mental status.
   - CTA chest.
   .
   # Lethargy/altered mental status.  With elevated pCO2, but which came
   first unclear as above.  Noted to have some abnls on I- head CT and
   RBCs in CSF (?explained by traumatic tap only).  Consider HSV in this
   setting.  Also possible - metabolic disturbances, effects of systemic
   illness, meds/toxins.  Tox screen negative.  Timecourse does not seem
   too c/w seizure. Based on imaging, Neuro input do no feel that this is
   SAH.
   - Sedation with propofol for now to allow frequent neuro exams.
   - Check EEG.
   - Acyclovir and check HSV PCR.
   - Treatment of systemic infection.
   .
   # Elevated troponin/ECG changes.  Initial ECG at OSH without major
   changes but here with small inferior STEs and small lateral STDs.  Some
   concern that ?changes related to cerebrovascular process, but now also
   with enzyme bump.
   - ASA 325 mg daily.  Start simvastatin.  Consider BB if BPs stabilize.
   - Readdress plavix and heparin gtt once SAH definitively ruled out.
   - Repeat ECG now, continue to cycle enzymes.
   - ECHO today
   .
   # RBCs in CSF.  Initial concern for SAH, but not present per
   neurosurg.  ?can all be explained by traumatic tap alone.  Also
   consider HSV with ongoing altered mental status.
   - Acyclovir as above.
   - Checking HSV PCR.
   .
   # Abnormal head CT.  ?past contrast exposure.  Neurosurg feels strongly
   that this is not SAH.  Also with abnormal CSF and altered mental status
   as above.
   - f/u final CTA read; alert neurosurg if anything suspcious.
   - MRI head.
   .
   # Abnormal CXR.  Prominent L hilum - ?enlarged PA.  Also with R base
   opacification - atelectasis vs. aspiration vs. typical pneumonia.
   Patient without significant healthcare or antibiotic exposures.  Given
   appearance of R base, ?aspiration.
   - vanc/ceftriaxone for ICU CAP, also add flagyl for aspiration
   coverage.
   - legionella UAg
   - Check echo to eval PA pressures.  Consider CXR if not pulmonary
   artery.
   .
   # Polycythemia.  Primary myeloproliferative process (given adenopathy)
   vs. secondary process from chronic hypoxia (?underlying lung disease -
   OHS, OSA, COPD, PA HTN, other).  Also consider hemoconcentration,
   though has not decreased with IVFs.
   - outside/PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - Check CO hemoglobin
   - ?therapeutic phlebotomy if > 55-60 given elevation in troponin?
   .
   # Proteinuria.  No DM or known renal disease.
   - PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - Serum albumin.
   - Check protein to creatinine ratio.
   .
   # Rash.  Unclear etiology.  NOt typical appearance of venous stasis
   rash or drug rash.
   - continue to monitor.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and untreated obstructive sleep apnea who presented with lethargy and sleepiness. He was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and an abnormal head CT. The patient's condition has been complex, with multiple potential medical complications.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient had an initial diagnosis of NSTEMI, with cardiac enzymes showing an upward trend from admission. Repeat ECGs showed resolution of inferior lead elevation seen in the initial ECG.
- The patient was started on heparin drip, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and ASA 325 daily. ASA was already given in the ED.
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/59 mmHg to 153/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, with bilateral rhonchi heard on pulmonary examination. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs are present on cardiac examination.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- Imaging studies reveal findings consistent with chronic small vessel infarction without characteristic signal pattern suggestive of herpes encephalitis. There is also mild high T2 signal within the mastoid sinus complexes, likely indicating an ongoing inflammatory process.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to obstructive sleep apnea. The etiology of the chronic component is unclear, and the acute component may be related to altered mental status and lethargy. No sedating medications were known.
- Other diagnoses include lethargy/altered mental status, elevated troponin/ECG changes, RBCs in CSF, abnormal head CT, and abnormal CXR.
- Treatment plans include continuing ventilator support, evaluating cardiac function, working up lethargy/altered mental status, and performing further imaging studies.
- Medications include ASA 325 mg daily, atorvastatin, metoprolol, heparin drip, propofol for sedation, acyclovir, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin T levels and ECG changes suggest ongoing cardiac ischemia or infarction. Further evaluation of cardiac function is planned, and the patient is being started on ASA and statin therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to obstructive sleep apnea. Continued ventilator support is planned, aiming for a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in the mid-high 60s with a pH in the low-mid 7.3 range.
3. Infection: The patient has suspected pneumonia, as indicated by the abnormal CXR showing right base opacification, which may be due to aspiration. Antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin and ceftriaxone for ICU-acquired pneumonia, along with flagyl for aspiration coverage.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and lethargy could be due to various causes, including metabolic disturbances, effects of systemic illness, or herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Sedation with propofol is being continued for now, and an EEG and HSV PCR are planned.
5. Renal complications: The patient has proteinuria, with no known renal disease or diabetes. Further evaluation is needed, including serum albumin and protein to creatinine ratio checks.
6. Hematological complications: The patient has polycythemia, which could be primary or secondary to chronic hypoxia. Further evaluation is needed, including outside PCP consultation and checking CO hemoglobin.
7. Other complications: The patient also has a rash of unclear etiology, and prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin are being continued.

   MRI Brain: Findings most consistent with chronic small vessel
   infarction, without characteristic signal pattern suggestive of herpes
   encephalitis. Nevertheless, if this diagnosis is suspected clinically,
   presumably, the patient is already receiving prophylactic acyclovir.
   ADDENDUM AND COMMENT: There is mild high T2 signal within the mastoid
   sinus complexes as well, likely indicating an ongoing inflammatory
   process as well. Finally, regarding the exclusion of acute subarachnoid
   hemorrhage, a CT scan is far more effective than an MRI in addressing
   this issue. In that regard, a CT scan was performed yesterday and did
   not appear to disclose subarachnoid blood at that time. Also, a CT
   angiogram, obtained yesterday as well, is quite useful in the exclusion
   of an aneurysm involving the circle of [**Location (un) 4456**] and major vascular
   tributaries.
   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, presenting with lethargy and sleepiness,
   now admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and ?abnormal head
   CT.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Clearly hypoventilatory at baseline
   given high bicarb on initial chems, but with acute component as well.
   Unclear etiology of chronic componenet - no history of COPD though long
   smoking history.  [**Month (only) 51**] be OHS.  Acute component - ?cause or effect of
   altered mental status and lethargy.  No sedating meds known.
   - Continue vent at current settings; goal pCo2 in mid-high 60s with pH
   in low-mid 7.3 range.
   - No e/o RAD on exam; hold steroids for now; BDs prn.
   - Treatment of pneumonia as below.
   - Eval of cardiac function.
   - Workup of lethargy/altered mental status.
   .
   # Lethargy/altered mental status.  With elevated pCO2, but which came
   first unclear as above.  Noted to have some abnls on I- head CT and
   RBCs in CSF (?explained by traumatic tap only).  Consider HSV in this
   setting.  Also possible - metabolic disturbances, effects of systemic
   illness, meds/toxins.  Tox screen negative.  Timecourse does not seem
   too c/w seizure.
   - Sedation with propofol for now to allow frequent neuro exams.
   - CHeck LFTs, TSH, B12, consider RPR.
   - f/u final read CTA head.
   - Check MRI whle intubated.
   - Check EEG.
   - Acyclovir and check HSV PCR.
   - Treatment of systemic infection.
   .
   # Elevated troponin/ECG changes.  Initial ECG at OSH without major
   changes but here with small inferior STEs and small lateral STDs.  Some
   concern that ?changes related to cerebrovascular process, but now also
   with enzyme bump.
   - ASA 325 mg daily.  Start simvastatin.  Consider BB if BPs stabilize.
   - Readdress plavix and heparin gtt once SAH definitively ruled out.
   - Repeat ECG now, continue to cycle enzymes.
   .
   # RBCs in CSF.  Initial concern for SAH, but not present per
   neurosurg.  ?can all be explained by traumatic tap alone.  Also
   consider HSV with ongoing altered mental status.
   - Acyclovir as above.
   - Checking HSV PCR.
   - f/u final head CTA read.
   .
   # Abnormal head CT.  ?past contrast exposure.  Neurosurg feels strongly
   that this is not SAH.  Also with abnormal CSF and altered mental status
   as above.
   - f/u final CTA read; alert neurosurg if anything suspcious.
   - MRI head.
   .
   # Abnormal CXR.  Prominent L hilum - ?enlarged PA.  Also with R base
   opacification - atelectasis vs. aspiration vs. typical pneumonia.
   Patient without significant healthcare or antibiotic exposures.  Given
   appearance of R base, ?aspiration.
   - vanc/ceftriaxone for ICU CAP, also add flagyl for aspiration
   coverage.
   - legionella UAg
   - Check echo to eval PA pressures.  Consider CXR if not pulmonary
   artery.
   .
   # Polycythemia.  Primary myeloproliferative process (given adenopathy)
   vs. secondary process from chronic hypoxia (?underlying lung disease -
   OHS, OSA, COPD, PA HTN, other).  Also consider hemoconcentration,
   though has not decreased with IVFs.
   - outside/PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - Check CO hemoglobin
   - ?therapeutic phlebotomy if > 55-60 given elevation in troponin?
   .
   # Proteinuria.  No DM or known renal disease.
   - PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - Serum albumin.
   - Check protein to creatinine ratio.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension and untreated obstructive sleep apnea. He presented with lethargy and sleepiness, which progressed to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient also has an abnormal head CT, possibly indicating chronic small vessel infarction without characteristic signal pattern suggestive of herpes encephalitis. Other findings include elevated troponin/ECG changes, RBCs in CSF (explained by traumatic tap), and an abnormal chest X-ray showing prominent L hilum and right base opacification, suggesting pneumonia or aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is hypoventilatory at baseline, leading to elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This condition can cause altered mental status, confusion, and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac issues: Elevated troponin levels and ECG changes indicate possible cardiac damage. This could be related to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease or a recent myocardial infarction.
3. Infection: The presence of RBCs in CSF initially raised concern for subarachnoid hemorrhage, but it is now attributed to a traumatic tap. However, the possibility of central nervous system infection, such as herpes encephalitis, should still be considered, especially with the abnormal head CT findings.
4. Pneumonia or aspiration: The abnormal chest X-ray suggests pneumonia or aspiration, which can lead"

   HPI
   61M with history of OSA, HTN, presenting with altered mental status,
   found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and ?abnormal head CT.
   He is in the area visiting family.  He kept falling asleep at home and
   noted generally not feeling well.  Has been leaning over to the right
   side x 1 week.  Family noted weight gain as well and gradually
   worsening falling asleep easily (mid sentance on the phone).  Two days
   prior to presentation he complained of back, leg, and neck pain.
   Family repeatedly found him slumped over.  No fevers/chills.  Brought
   to [**Location (un) 250**], noted to be altered and with respiratory distress.  pCO2
   120 on ABG with low pO2.  Intubated.  Got levoflox for pneumonia.  CT
   head with findings somewhat concerning for SAH (?retained contrast from
   prior CT, but never had a prior contrast study).  Did have an episode
   of SBP 80, responding to fluids.  Transferred for neurosurgical eval.
   .
   In the [**Hospital1 19**] ED, initial vs were: T P84 BP 112/80 R18 100%. Patient was
   given fent/midaz, solumedrol 125, ceftriaxone, flagyl, pantoprazole.
   CTA performed with no evidence of aneurysm.  Neurosurgery did not feel
   this was c/w SAH.  LP performed; tube 1 with 925 rbcs (no
   xanthrochromia), tube 4 with 305 rbcs.  Discussed with neurosurg
   ([**Doctor Last Name **]) and picture thought not c/w SAH.  Also noted to have ECG
   changes - <1 mm STE inferiorly.  ECGs discussed with cards, who did not
   feel c/w STEMI.  Trops 0.05-> 0.08.  Did get ASA here.  Admit to MICU

 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), HEMORRHAGIC
   Assessment and Plan: 61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of
   hypersomnolence, progressing to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   noted on arrival. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. Nonetheless, it is possible that some
   brainstem process led to both reduced level of consciousness or
   hypoventilation, or both, possibly with obstructive events.  This may
   have then predisposed him to ACS.  However, the nature of these
   brainstem lesions is not clear.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Hypoventilatory at baseline given high bicarbonate on initial
   chemistry, but with acute component as well. Unclear etiology of
   chronic component - no history of COPD though long smoking history. No
   sedating meds known. A central cause of this and his altered mental
   status are possible, possibly with added obstruction.
   - Continue vent at current settings; goal pCo2 in mid-high 60s with pH
   in low-mid 7.3 range.
   - Treatment of pneumonia as below.
   - Atempt to solve this respiratory issue first, then see how neurologic
   status evolves
 may involve Neurology
   # Lethargy/altered mental status
   With elevated pCO2, but which came first unclear as above.  TSH, B12,
   medications, metabolic disturbance is not obviously responsible. Tox.
   screen negative. Seizure unlikely, vascular event also somewhat
   unlikely. EEG shows about 8 Hz at most, with typically disorganized
   slowing. This is not diagnostic.  Sleep-wake is not intact
 consistent
   with encephalopathy, most likely, but also with impaired sleep-wake
   circuitry. Presentation and MRI not consistent with herpes
   encephalitis. Tertiary syphilis not really very consistent with
   presentation.  Other CNS infections and the etiology of increased
   brainstem signal need to be considered.  Hyperphagia also interesting,
   along with impaired arousal for hypothalamic cause and/or possible
   post-infectious encephalitis. Will consider CSF electrophoresis if
   mental status not improved after resolution of hypercarbia etc.
   - Continue acyclovir for now
 despite unlikely of benefit
 until
   situation is clearer.
   - Treatment of systemic infection.
   # Elevated troponin/ECG changes.
   Initial ECG at OSH without major changes but here with small inferior
   STEs and small lateral STDs.  At the time concerning for
   cerebrovascular process, but then a significant enzyme leak.  This
   appears to be trending down now and the heparin gtt was stopped.  This
   was likely secondary to respiratory failure.
   - ASA 325 mg daily;  Simvastatin;
   - Readdress plavix on rounds
   # Abnormal CXR
   Prominent L hilum - ?enlarged PA.  Also with R base opacification -
   atelectasis vs. aspiration vs. typical pneumonia.  Patient without
   significant healthcare or antibiotic exposures.  Given appearance of R
   base, ?aspiration.
   - vanc/ceftriaxone for ICU CAP, also add flagyl for aspiration
   coverage.
   - legionella UAg
   - Check echo to eval PA pressures.  Consider CXR if not pulmonary
   artery.
   # Polycythemia
   Primary myeloproliferative process (given adenopathy) vs. secondary
   process from chronic hypoxia (underlying lung disease - OHS, OSA, COPD,
   PA HTN, other).  Also consider hemoconcentration, though has not
   decreased with IVFs.
   - outside/PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - Check CO hemoglobin
   - ?therapeutic phlebotomy if > 55-60 given elevation in troponin?
   # Proteinuria
   No DM or known renal disease.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension presenting with marked stupor and respiratory failure. The patient had been experiencing hypersomnolence, hyperphagia, and postural instability for one week prior to presentation. He was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and an abnormal head CT, which showed widespread small vessel disease and similar regions of increased signal in the pontine nuclei. The patient's respiratory parameters were consistent with increased dead-space, and the etiology of the chronic component of his hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear.

The patient also had elevated troponin levels and ECG changes, indicating possible myocardial infarction. The patient was treated with heparin, but it was later stopped due to peaked cardiac enzymes and a negative CT angiography (CTA). The patient's CXR showed prominent L hilum and right base opacification, suggesting pneumonia, possibly aspiration-related. He was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and added with flagyl for aspiration coverage.

The patient's polycythemia needs further evaluation, considering both primary myeloproliferative process and secondary process from chronic hypoxia. His proteinuria requires assessment for possible renal disease. The rash is unclear in etiology and should be monitored. The patient is currently on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and has peripheral access."

   HPI
   61M with history of OSA, HTN, presenting with altered mental status,
   found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and ?abnormal head CT.
   He is in the area visiting family.  He kept falling asleep at home and
   noted generally not feeling well.  Has been leaning over to the right
   side x 1 week.  Family noted weight gain as well and gradually
   worsening falling asleep easily (mid sentance on the phone).  Two days
   prior to presentation he complained of back, leg, and neck pain.
   Family repeatedly found him slumped over.  No fevers/chills.  Brought
   to [**Location (un) 250**], noted to be altered and with respiratory distress.  pCO2
   120 on ABG with low pO2.  Intubated.  Got levoflox for pneumonia.  CT
   head with findings somewhat concerning for SAH (?retained contrast from
   prior CT, but never had a prior contrast study).  Did have an episode
   of SBP 80, responding to fluids.  Transferred for neurosurgical eval.
   .
   In the [**Hospital1 19**] ED, initial vs were: T P84 BP 112/80 R18 100%. Patient was
   given fent/midaz, solumedrol 125, ceftriaxone, flagyl, pantoprazole.
   CTA performed with no evidence of aneurysm.  Neurosurgery did not feel
   this was c/w SAH.  LP performed; tube 1 with 925 rbcs (no
   xanthrochromia), tube 4 with 305 rbcs.  Discussed with neurosurg
   ([**Doctor Last Name **]) and picture thought not c/w SAH.  Also noted to have ECG
   changes - <1 mm STE inferiorly.  ECGs discussed with cards, who did not
   feel c/w STEMI.  Trops 0.05-> 0.08.  Did get ASA here.  Admit to MICU

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension presenting with marked stupor and respiratory failure after one week of hypersomnolence, hyperphagia, and postural instability. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Initial lab results show elevated troponin levels and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial infarction. MRI brain findings indicate widespread small vessel disease and increased signal in the pontine nuclei. The patient has been treated for suspected pneumonia and continues to receive prophylactic antibiotics. His respiratory status is being closely monitored, and efforts are being made to improve his mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is a significant concern. If not managed properly, it could lead to further deterioration in his respiratory function.
2. Myocardial Infarction: Elevated troponin levels and ECG changes suggest the presence of myocardial infarction. It is important to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and continue with appropriate cardiac support.
3. Stroke: The MRI brain findings showing widespread small vessel disease and increased signal in the pontine nuclei raise concerns for a cerebrovascular event. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of neurological deterioration.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for suspected pneumonia. If left untreated or not adequately managed, this infection can worsen and lead to se"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension who presented with marked stupor and respiratory failure. He had been experiencing hypersomnolence, hyperphagia, and postural instability for about a week. The patient also had an episode of systemic hypotension and was found to have an elevated carbon dioxide level on arterial blood gas (ABG). He was intubated and sedated in the emergency department. 

The patient's conditions include pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke (cerebral infarction), and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has undergone several tests, including a computed tomography angiography (CTA), an echocardiogram (echo), and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain.

Plan:
1. Continue mechanical ventilation at current settings with a goal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in the mid-high 60s and pH in the low-mid 7.3 range.
2. Hold steroids for now; administer bronchodilators as needed.
3. Treat pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and add flagyl for aspiration coverage.
4. Evaluate cardiac function.
5. Investigate the cause of lethargy and altered mental status, considering metabolic disturbances, effects of systemic illness, medications, or toxins.
6. Sedate the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, and long smoking history. He presented with lethargy and sleepiness and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues, including myocardial infarction, bacterial pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and possible metabolic disturbances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to the underlying causes such as pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and potential aspiration.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), HEMORRHAGIC
   Assessment and Plan: 61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of
   hypersomnolence, progressing to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   noted on arrival. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. Nonetheless, it is possible that some
   brainstem process led to both reduced level of consciousness or
   hypoventilation, or both, possibly with obstructive events.  This may
   have then predisposed him to ACS.  However, the nature of these
   brainstem lesions is not clear.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Hypoventilatory at baseline given high bicarbonate on initial
   chemistry, but with acute component as well. Unclear etiology of
   chronic component - no history of COPD though long smoking history. No
   sedating meds known. A central cause of this and his altered mental
   status are possible, possibly with added obstruction.
   - Continue vent at current settings; goal pCo2 in mid-high 60s with pH
   in low-mid 7.3 range.
   - Treatment of pneumonia as below.
   - Atempt to solve this respiratory issue first, then see how neurologic
   status evolves
 may involve Neurology
   # Lethargy/altered mental status
   With elevated pCO2, but which came first unclear as above.  TSH, B12,
   medications, metabolic disturbance is not obviously responsible. Tox.
   screen negative. Seizure unlikely, vascular event also somewhat
   unlikely. EEG shows about 8 Hz at most, with typically disorganized
   slowing. This is not diagnostic.  Sleep-wake is not intact
 consistent
   with encephalopathy, most likely, but also with impaired sleep-wake
   circuitry. Presentation and MRI not consistent with herpes
   encephalitis. Tertiary syphilis not really very consistent with
   presentation.  Other CNS infections and the etiology of increased
   brainstem signal need to be considered.  Hyperphagia also interesting,
   along with impaired arousal for hypothalamic cause and/or possible
   post-infectious encephalitis. Will consider CSF electrophoresis if
   mental status not improved after resolution of hypercarbia etc.
   - Continue acyclovir for now
 despite unlikely of benefit
 until
   situation is clearer.
   - Treatment of systemic infection.
   # Rash
   # Elevated troponin/ECG changes.
   Initial ECG at OSH without major changes but here with small inferior
   STEs and small lateral STDs.  At the time concerning for
   cerebrovascular process, but then a significant enzyme leak.  This
   appears to be trending down now and the heparin gtt was stopped.  This
   was likely secondary to respiratory failure.
   - ASA 325 mg daily;  Simvastatin;
   - Readdress plavix on rounds
   # Polycythemia
   Primary myeloproliferative process (given adenopathy) vs. secondary
   process from chronic hypoxia (underlying lung disease - OHS, OSA, COPD,
   PA HTN, other).  Also consider hemoconcentration, though has not
   decreased considerably with IVFs.
   # Proteinuria
   No DM or known renal disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be worth checking albumin versus
   protein or UPEP.
   - Repeat UA

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a recent episode of hypersomnolence progressing to stupor. The patient also has hypercarbic respiratory failure and increased dead space on the respiratory parameters.

The MRI shows diffuse brain disease including subcortical white matter and pons. The etiology of the brainstem lesions is not clear. The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may be due to a central cause, possibly with added obstruction.

The patient's lab results show elevated troponin levels and ECG changes, which were initially concerning for a cerebrovascular process but are now trending down. The patient has been on ASA, simvastatin, and Plavix, and the heparin gtt was stopped.

The patient also has polycythemia, which could be primary or secondary to chronic hypoxia. Proteinuria is also noted without a history of diabetes or known renal disease.

The patient's family has reported that he has been leaning to the right for a week, and there is mention of possible post-infectious encephalitis or hypothalamic cause.

Considering all these findings, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
2. Pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP)
3. Respiratory failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival. Family
   also reported that the patient had been leaning to the right for that
   week. MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and
   pons. Respiratory parameters also consistent with increased dead-space.
   The etiology is unclear, but MRI is only consistent with a vascular
   event more than one week ago (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular
   event is not really consistent with the history. We now consider this
   less likely in view of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic
   presentation may have been secondary to respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Hypoventilatory at baseline given high bicarbonate on initial
   chemistry, but with acute component as well. Unclear etiology of
   chronic component - no history of COPD though long smoking history. No
   sedating meds known. Possible COPD having a role, with poor ventilation
   noted. Unclear if relates to gas diffusion limit or perfusion. Given
   very dramatic smoking history may be a manifestation of smoking-related
   lung injury. Some suspicion still for PNA at this point.

   - Treatment of pneumonia as below.
   - Can likely tolerate even higher CO2
   Lethargy/altered mental status

   [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug [**Name (NI) 1350**]) or, perhaps less
   likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   Resolving enzyme leak.  Ensure on ASA, BB, statin and possibly ACEI on
   discharge and when tolerated (pressure presently lowered by Propofol).

   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI

   Polycythemia
   Primary myeloproliferative process (given adenopathy) vs. more likely
   secondary process from chronic hypoxia (underlying lung disease - OHS,

   not decreased considerably with IVFs.

   Proteinuria
   No DM or known renal disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be worth checking albumin versus

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a one-week history of hypersomnolence progressing to stupor. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, and his MRI showed diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons. The etiology of his neurologic presentation is unclear, but it may have been secondary to respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory parameters are consistent with increased dead-space, and he has been receiving mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is characterized by elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood due to inadequate ventilation. This condition can lead to acidosis and potential complications such as cerebral edema, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for pneumonia, indicating a possible underlying infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, pneumonia can progress and lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.

3. Drug reaction or viral exanthem: The patient exhibits skin manifestations that resemble a drug reaction or viral exanthem. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and prevent any potential complications related to drug reactions or viral infections.

4. Elevated troponin/ECG changes: The patient had elevated troponin levels and ECG changes, suggesting myocardial injury or"

   Changed to PSV yesterday.  NIF was

   still intubated.  We think it is still wise to continue antibiotics,
   even though OSA, COPD or PNA may be contributing. Wean PSV to [**10-16**] and
   then decrease PEEP. Large dead space presumably due to COPD that has
   preferentially resulted in pulmonary vascular injury and vessel

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), one week of hypersomnolence progressing to stupor, and hypercarbic respiratory failure on arrival. The patient's MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters are consistent with increased dead-space.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of untreated OSA and is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition can lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, causing respiratory acidosis and potential complications such as confusion, disorientation, and ultimately respiratory arrest if not managed properly.

2. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological presentation may have been secondary to respiratory failure. The MRI findings suggest diffuse disease involving subcortical white matter and pons. This indicates possible damage to the brain tissue due to lack of oxygen supply, which can result in cognitive deficits, speech problems, weakness, and other neurological symptoms.

3. Polycythemia: The patient has elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, indicating polycythemia. This condition can be secondary to chronic hypoxia from underlying lung diseases like OHS, OSA, COPD, PA HTN, or a primary myeloproliferative process. Polycythemia can increase the risk of thrombosis and complications related to blood viscosity.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival. Family
   also reported that the patient had been leaning to the right for that
   week. MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and
   pons. Respiratory parameters also consistent with increased dead-space.
   The etiology is unclear, but MRI is only consistent with a vascular
   event more than one week ago (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular
   event is not really consistent with the history. We now consider this
   less likely in view of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic
   presentation may have been secondary to respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Changed to PSV yesterday.  NIF was
 17 yesterday and 12 this a.m.  We
   are concerned firstly for a neuromuscular disorder, then possibility of
   brainstem lesion on MRI and possibility that this is contributing to
   his phenotype.  Wean attempted, but still intubated.  We think it is
   still wise to continue antibiotics, even though OSA, COPD or PNA may be
   contributing. Wean PSV to [**10-16**] and then decrease PEEP. Large dead
   space presumably due to COPD that has preferentially resulted in
   pulmonary vascular injury and vessel dropout.
   - Pressure support to 15/5
   - Talk to Neurology about CNS or PNS/neuromuscular contributions
   - F/u CXR
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status (at
   least when off proprofol), but full neurologic exam not yet performed.
   Etiology otherwise unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1765**] [**1-3**] note for further discussion.
   - Follow and evaluate when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - BB when tolerable
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Primary myeloproliferative process (given adenopathy) vs. more likely
   secondary process from chronic hypoxia (underlying lung disease - OHS,
   OSA, COPD, PA HTN, other).  Also consider hemoconcentration, though has
   not decreased considerably with IVFs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and one week of hypersomnolence progressing to stupor. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and an MRI showing diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons. The etiology is unclear, but it is considered less likely to be a vascular event. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support to 15/5.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to acidosis and subsequent effects on various organ systems, including the brain, heart, and kidneys.
2. Neurologic presentation: The patient's neurologic symptoms, such as altered mental status and leaning to the right, may be secondary to respiratory failure or a brainstem lesion.
3. Neuromuscular disorder: The patient's respiratory parameters suggest a neuromuscular disorder contributing to his phenotype.
4. Brainstem lesion: The MRI findings indicate diffuse disease including the pons, raising concerns about a possible brainstem lesion.
5. Polycythemia: The patient has elevated hemoglobin levels, which could be due to a primary myeloproliferative process or secondary to chronic hypoxia from underlying lung disease.
6. Proteinuria: The patient has proteinuria, which may be related to kidney dysfunction or other underlying conditions"

MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons, but the etiology is unclear. The neurologic presentation may have been secondary to respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, lethargy/altered mental status, rash, elevated troponin/ECG changes, polycythemia, and proteinuria. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is a condition where there is an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream due to inadequate ventilation. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and other systemic complications.
2. Lethargy/Altered Mental Status: The patient's lethargy and altered mental status may be related to the respiratory failure or another underlying condition. These symptoms need to be closely monitored and evaluated.
3. Rash: The patient has a resolving rash, which may be a drug reaction or viral exanthem. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Elevated Troponin/EC"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The chief complaint includes leaning to the right, hypersomnia, stupor, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/64 mmHg to 127/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory issues mentioned earlier. The flow sheet data shows normal fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and weight within normal limits. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, tidal volume of 334 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 55 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 134 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The negative inspiratory force (NIF) is -"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro: Identified left upper extremity weakness, with normal
   sensation. Would like Cervical MRI to evaluate brachial plexus nerve
   roots and cause of left upper extremity weakness with normal sensation.
   Also recommend EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies.
   - 20mg IV Lasix, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 775**] noticed he was volume up over
   hospitalization, thought this may be contributing.
   - Changed to CMV overnight after he became dysynchronous with vent.
   -Neurology Consult:
   Assessment and Plan: 61M with HTN, untreated OSA, presenting with
   lethargy and sleepiness, now admitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure and ?abnormal head CT and MRI s/o possible
   old gliotic lesion in pontine area.
   The failure form weaning could be a part of his OSA syndrome or
   could be due to NM disease. however the former seems more likely.
   He does not have any exam findings suggestive on MG but exam is
   limited due to intubated status. the finding on exam about LUE
   weakness could possible reflect plexus or nerve root pathology as
   the pattern seems to be of LMN in origin.
   - Would like Cervical MRI to evaluate brachial plexus nerve roots
   and cause of left upper extremity weakness with normal sensation.
   - Also recommend EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies.
   - will follow up with you.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival. Family
   also reported that the patient had been leaning to the right for that
   week. MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and
   pons. Respiratory parameters also consistent with increased dead-space.
   The etiology is unclear, but MRI is only consistent with a vascular
   event more than one week ago (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular
   event is not really consistent with the history. We now consider this
   less likely in view of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic
   presentation may have been secondary to respiratory failure.
   Agree with plan to manage hypoxic / hypercarbic respiratory failure
   ongoing PSV today, will recheck muscle forces, f/u BAL, and continue
   abx for presumptive pneumonia complicating COPD and OSA. Will try to
   wean PSV to [**12-11**]. Large dead space presumably due to COPD that has
   preferentially resulted in pulmonary vascular injury and vessel dropout
   as well as increased Vd/Vt d/t shallow respirations; no e/o PE.
   OSA/COPD/PNA do not explain very low NIF and failure on low level PSV.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with hypertension and untreated obstructive sleep apnea who presented with lethargy and sleepiness. He was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and has an abnormal head CT and MRI showing a possible old gliotic lesion in the pontine area. The failure to wean from the ventilator could be due to his OSA syndrome or neuromuscular disease (NMD), with the former seeming more likely. The patient also has left upper extremity weakness with normal sensation, which may indicate brachial plexus or nerve root pathology. A cervical MRI is recommended to evaluate this further, along with EMG and nerve conduction studies.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/59 mmHg to 115/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 148.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival. Family
   also reported that the patient had been leaning to the right for that
   week. MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and
   pons. Respiratory parameters also consistent with increased dead-space.
   The etiology is unclear, but MRI is only consistent with a vascular
   event more than one week ago (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular
   event is not really consistent with the history. We now consider this
   less likely in view of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic
   presentation may have been secondary to respiratory failure.
   Agree with plan to manage hypoxic / hypercarbic respiratory failure
   ongoing PSV today, will recheck muscle forces, f/u BAL, and continue
   abx for presumptive pneumonia complicating COPD and OSA. Will try to
   wean PSV to [**12-11**]. Large dead space presumably due to COPD that has
   preferentially resulted in pulmonary vascular injury and vessel dropout
   as well as increased Vd/Vt d/t shallow respirations; no e/o PE.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a significant smoking history. He presented with lethargy and sleepiness, which progressed to stupor. He was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient also has left upper extremity weakness with normal sensation and is currently intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient's symptoms of lethargy, sleepiness, and stupor could be indicative of a neurological disorder. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, which may include a brainstem lesion, neuromuscular disorder, or other central nervous system (CNS) pathology.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure requires ongoing management. The respiratory parameters indicate increased dead-space, suggesting potential pulmonary vascular injury and vessel dropout. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support are necessary.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI. He is stable on aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy. Cardiology follow-up is recommended for ongoing management.
4. Infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for presumed pneumonia complicating COPD and OSA. Microbiology results show no growth, indicating a lack of bacterial infection. Continued antibiotic coverage may be considered based on clinical judgment.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view
   of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic presentation may have
   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   Changed to PSV yesterday, then back to AC overnight given desynchony of
   respiratory effort and ventilator.  [**Month (only) 51**] return to PSV again during the
   day today. NIF was
 17 on Tuesday and - 12 yesterday, indicating
   investigation of neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or
   mysasthenia (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical
   exam).  Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency.  Unclear at this point whether primarily respiratory,
   peripheral nervous or central etiology. Therefore they recommended MRA,
   cervical MRI (also noted LUE weakness), nerve conduction studies, EMG
   and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. No evidence for PE, but
   mismatch would account for poor ventilation/oxygenation on given vent
   settings. Given extensive smoking history and unusually large minute
   volume for CO2 ventilation, likely smoking-related changes, perhaps
   vascular.  CK is quite elevated also.
   - Repeat NIF
   - Recheck CK
   - Trial PSV again this afternoon
   - Allow CO2 to drift up given that he likely retains at baseline
   - Continue ceftriaxone until [**2117-1-9**] (levofloxacin stopped)
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - MRA brain
   - MRI (w/ gad) cervical cord and roots
   - Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status (at
   least when off proprofol

   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology

   Disposition:
","Summary:
- 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a significant smoking history presenting with lethargy and sleepiness.
- Admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and possible old gliotic lesion in the pontine area.
- Neurological evaluation suggests a potential peripheral nervous system cause for weakness and altered mental status.
- The patient's respiratory parameters are consistent with increased dead-space, and there is a possibility of a vascular event more than one week ago.
- The patient's condition has been stable, and they have shown improvement in respiratory status.
- Recommended investigations include MRA brain, cervical MRI, nerve conduction studies, EMG, and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies.
- Other medical conditions include polycythemia, NSTEMI, and a rash that is resolving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypercarbic respiratory failure, indicating impaired gas exchange. Further complications could arise if the respiratory status worsens or if there is difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Neurological Complications: Given the neurological symptoms and findings on MRI, there is a possibility of complications related to the central nervous system or peripheral nervous system. These could include worsening of neurological deficits, development of new neurological symptoms, or progression of the existing condition.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI, which indicates a potential risk for further cardiac events"

   61 M w/ HTN, OSA, ~120 pack-year smoking history, w/ one week of
   leaning to right, hypersomnolance, p/w hypercarbic respiratory failure
   and NSTEMI.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro: Identified left upper extremity weakness, with normal
   sensation. Would like Cervical MRI to evaluate brachial plexus nerve
   roots and cause of left upper extremity weakness with normal sensation.
   Also recommend EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies.
   - 20mg IV Lasix, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 775**] noticed he was volume up over
   hospitalization, thought this may be contributing.
   - Changed to CMV overnight after he became dysynchronous with vent.
   -Neurology Consult:
Assessment and Plan: 61M with HTN, untreated OSA, presenting with
   lethargy and sleepiness, now admitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure and ?abnormal head CT and MRI s/o possible
   old gliotic lesion in pontine area.
The failure form weaning could be a part of his OSA syndrome or
   could be due to NM disease. however the former seems more likely.
   He does not have any exam findings suggestive on MG but exam is
   limited due to intubated status. the finding on exam about LUE
   weakness could possible reflect plexus or nerve root pathology as
   the pattern seems to be of LMN in origin.
- Would like MRA brain (? vertebrobasilar insufficiency) and Cervical
   MRI to evaluate brachial plexus nerve roots and cause of left upper
   extremity weakness with normal sensation.
- Also recommend EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies.

   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   Changed to PSV yesterday, then back to AC overnight given desynchony of
   respiratory effort and ventilator.  [**Month (only) 51**] return to PSV again during the
   day today. NIF was
 17 on Tuesday and - 12 yesterday, indicating
   investigation of neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or
   mysasthenia (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical
   exam).  Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency.  Unclear at this point whether primarily respiratory,
   peripheral nervous or central etiology. Therefore they recommended MRA,
   cervical MRI (also noted LUE weakness), nerve conduction studies, EMG
   and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. No evidence for PE, but
   mismatch would account for poor ventilation/oxygenation on given vent
   settings. Given extensive smoking history and unusually large minute
   volume for CO2 ventilation, likely smoking-related changes, perhaps
   vascular.  CK is quite elevated also.
   - Repeat NIF
   - Recheck CK
   - Trial PSV again this afternoon

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and a significant smoking history. He presented with one week of lethargy and sleepiness, which progressed to stupor. He was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and an NSTEMI. On examination, he had diffuse wheezing, no bronchial sounds, and a rash on his back, buttocks, legs, and feet. His vital signs were stable, but his ABG showed respiratory acidosis. Imaging revealed cardiomegaly, unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis, small left pleural effusion, minimal improvement in right pleural effusion, and adjacent atelectasis. 

The patient's condition was complicated by various medical complications. He had an elevated troponin and ECG changes indicative of an NSTEMI, for which he is being treated with ASA, BB, and a statin. He also has polycythemia, likely related to COPD/OSA. 

Neurologically, the patient had weakness in his left upper extremity with normal sensation, which may be due to a peripheral nervous system cause such as Guillain-Barre syndrome or myasthenia gravis. An MRI of the brain showed diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons, but no diffusion abnormalities. 

The patient's respiratory status improved with changes in ventilator settings and the use of noninvasive positive pressure"

   61 M w/ HTN, OSA, ~120 pack-year smoking history, w/ one week of
   leaning to right, hypersomnolance, p/w hypercarbic respiratory failure
   and NSTEMI.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro: Identified left upper extremity weakness, with normal
   sensation. Would like Cervical MRI to evaluate brachial plexus nerve
   roots and cause of left upper extremity weakness with normal sensation.
   Also recommend EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies.
   - 20mg IV Lasix, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 775**] noticed he was volume up over
   hospitalization, thought this may be contributing.
   - Changed to CMV overnight after he became dysynchronous with vent.
   -Neurology Consult:
Assessment and Plan: 61M with HTN, untreated OSA, presenting with
   lethargy and sleepiness, now admitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure and ?abnormal head CT and MRI s/o possible
   old gliotic lesion in pontine area.
The failure form weaning could be a part of his OSA syndrome or
   could be due to NM disease. however the former seems more likely.
   He does not have any exam findings suggestive on MG but exam is
   limited due to intubated status. the finding on exam about LUE
   weakness could possible reflect plexus or nerve root pathology as
   the pattern seems to be of LMN in origin.
- Would like MRA brain (? vertebrobasilar insufficiency) and Cervical
   MRI to evaluate brachial plexus nerve roots and cause of left upper
   extremity weakness with normal sensation.
- Also recommend EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies.

   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a significant smoking history.
- He presented with lethargy, sleepiness, and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient's neurological examination showed left upper extremity weakness with normal sensation, and he has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- Imaging studies revealed diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons, with no evidence of diffusion.
- The patient's respiratory parameters are consistent with increased dead-space, and there is a concern for a central or neuromuscular (NM) cause of his neurological symptoms.
- The patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI and is currently stable on aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy.
- He also has polycythemia likely related to COPD/OSA.
- The patient's condition remains critical, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypercarbic respiratory failure, which indicates an impaired ability to eliminate carbon dioxide from the body. This can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
2. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI, which is a type"

         <10 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
         QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view
   of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic presentation may have
   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Changed back to AC yesterday given desynchony of respiratory effort and
   ventilator.  Saturation worsened slightly yesterday and PEEP increased
   to 8 to maintain sat O2 at 90-92, but spontaneously improved to 95%
   around midnight.  NIF last done two days ago
 was -12.  Will repeat.
   Investigation of neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or
   mysasthenia (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical
   exam).  Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency.  Unclear at this point whether primarily respiratory,
   peripheral nervous or central etiology. MRA brain, MRI (w/ gad)
   cervical cord and roots and Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
   pending.  Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible
   PNA contributing to complete ceftriaxone d7 on [**1-9**], completed 5 d of
   levo yesterday. Still copious secretions that did not improve with
   diuresis.  On the other hand, improved respiratory status did occur
   after diuresis, suggesting pulmonary edema may have some role.
   - Repeat NIF
   - Back to PSV now more stable [**12-11**]
   - Reduce PEEP again to 5
   - Allow CO2 to drift up given that he likely retains at baseline
   - Continue ceftriaxone until [**2117-1-9**] (levofloxacin stopped)
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Repeat Lasix 20 m.g with goal to be even, with respect to Is & Os, or
   slightly negative today.
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. HSV negative by PCR (CSF).
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 61M HTN, OSA p/w hypercarbic respiratory
   failure and NSTEMI.  He continues to have sig secretions. Desatturated
   over night, did not appear dysnchronous or agitated. Placed on ACV with
   increased peep. Was diuresed.  Back on PS 12/5 this am.

   at this time. Would diurese, continue MDIs, con't treatment
   for presumptive pneumonia, now s/p levo day [**5-11**], continuing ctx day
   [**6-13**]. Would repeat sputum cx given increased secretions and follow cxr.
   He has not tolerated lower PS levels (not explained by PNA/COPD)
   and has had low nifs and diffuse weakness on exam concerning for NM or
   central process (? MG, ALS, cerebral-basilar insuff) which we are
   working up.  Neurology input appreciated.  Will f/u brain and c-spine
   MRI. Nerve conduction studies, emg and  acetylcholine receptor levels
   are ordered, we will follow NIF and neuro examination, CPKs, and supp
   phos/lytes as needed. If NIF improving could try wean. In terms of
   recent NSTEMI, remains stable on asa, BBL, statin; cards
   following. Picc line in place.. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and one week of hypersomnolence progressing to stupor. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's recent events include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical cord, which showed diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons. The patient also had respiratory parameters consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but the MRI is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really consistent with the history. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F) -> 37.5°C (99.5°F)
- Heart rate: 79-99 bpm
- Blood pressure: 126/73 mmHg -> 90/58 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 17 inspiratory breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 95%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination findings include wheezing throughout the chest, normal heart sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, no muscle wasting, moderate scrotal edema (improved from yesterday), trace dependent edema, and"

         QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view
   of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic presentation may have
   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Changed back to AC yesterday given desynchony of respiratory effort and
   ventilator.  Saturation worsened slightly yesterday and PEEP increased
   to 8 to maintain sat O2 at 90-92, but spontaneously improved to 95%
   around midnight.  NIF last done two days ago
 was -12.  Will repeat.
   Investigation of neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or
   mysasthenia (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical
   exam).  Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency.  Unclear at this point whether primarily respiratory,
   peripheral nervous or central etiology. MRA brain, MRI (w/ gad)
   cervical cord and roots and Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
   pending.  Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible
   PNA contributing to complete ceftriaxone d7 on [**1-9**], completed 5 d of
   levo yesterday. Still copious secretions that did not improve with
   diuresis.  On the other hand, improved respiratory status did occur
   after diuresis, suggesting pulmonary edema may have some role.
   - Repeat NIF
   - Back to PSV now more stable [**12-11**]
   - Reduce PEEP again to 5
   - Allow CO2 to drift up given that he likely retains at baseline
   - Continue ceftriaxone until [**2117-1-9**] (levofloxacin stopped)
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Repeat Lasix 20 m.g with goal to be even, with respect to Is & Os, or
   slightly negative today.
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. HSV negative by PCR (CSF).
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and one week of hypersomnolence progressing to stupor. The patient is currently in the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction), and an unclear etiology of his neurological presentation.

The patient's respiratory parameters indicate increased dead-space and the need for assisted ventilation. The MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons, which could suggest a vascular event. However, the improvement of the patient's respiratory status and weaning off sedation suggests that the neurological presentation may be secondary to respiratory failure rather than a primary neurological cause.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezing throughout respiration with coarse sounds markedly reduced, no bronchial sounds appreciated, moderate scrotal edema (improved from yesterday), trace dependent edema, and urticarial rash on the back, buttocks, legs, and feet. The rash is resolving, but the etiology is unclear.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin levels and ECG changes consistent with NSTEMI, which is stable on ASA (aspirin), BB (beta-blocker), and statin therapy. The patient is also being considered for ACEI (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) on discharge.

The patient's ICU care includes replete"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and one week of hypersomnolence progressing to stupor. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and NSTEMI, now stable. The patient's MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons. The etiology is unclear, but a vascular event is less likely given the patient's recovery. Peripheral nervous system causes are also being considered due to generalized weakness on examination. The patient has been changed back to assist-control (AC) ventilation due to desynchronization of respiratory effort and the ventilator. His saturation worsened slightly yesterday but spontaneously improved to 95% around midnight. Further investigations, such as MRA brain, MRI (w/ gad) cervical cord and roots, and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, are pending. The patient may have smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible pneumonia contributing to the decision to continue ceftriaxone until [**2117-1-9**]. The patient's lethargy/altered mental status appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status. The patient's rash is resolving, and the elevated troponin/ECG changes indicate a stable NSTEMI. The patient is being managed with ASA, BB, statin, and possible ACEI on discharge. Polycythemia is stable and likely related to COPD/OSA."

         QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view
   of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic presentation may have
   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   Changed to PSV yesterday, then back to AC overnight given desynchony of
   respiratory effort and ventilator.  [**Month (only) 51**] return to PSV again during the
   day today. NIF was
 17 on Tuesday and - 12 yesterday, indicating
   investigation of neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or
   mysasthenia (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical
   exam).  Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency.  Unclear at this point whether primarily respiratory,
   peripheral nervous or central etiology. Therefore they recommended MRA,
   cervical MRI (also noted LUE weakness), nerve conduction studies, EMG
   and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. No evidence for PE, but
   mismatch would account for poor ventilation/oxygenation on given vent
   settings. Given extensive smoking history and unusually large minute
   volume for CO2 ventilation, likely smoking-related changes, perhaps
   vascular.  CK is quite elevated also.
   - Repeat NIF
   - Recheck CK
   - Trial PSV again this afternoon
   - Allow CO2 to drift up given that he likely retains at baseline
   - Continue ceftriaxone until [**2117-1-9**] (levofloxacin stopped)
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - MRA brain
   - MRI (w/ gad) cervical cord and roots
   - Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status (at
   least when off proprofol
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.

The MRI showed diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons. The respiratory parameters are consistent with increased dead-space, and the etiology is unclear.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including propofol infusion, furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/73 to 147/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, electrolyte levels, and liver function tests. However, the lactic acid level is elevated at 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient's neurological examination reveals generalized weakness, and the neurologist suspects a peripheral nervous system cause such as Guillain-Barre syndrome or myasthenia gravis. Additionally, the possibility of"

         QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view
   of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic presentation may have
   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   Changed to PSV yesterday, then back to AC overnight given desynchony of
   respiratory effort and ventilator.  [**Month (only) 51**] return to PSV again during the
   day today. NIF was
 17 on Tuesday and - 12 yesterday, indicating
   investigation of neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or
   mysasthenia (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical
   exam).  Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency.  Unclear at this point whether primarily respiratory,
   peripheral nervous or central etiology. Therefore they recommended MRA,
   cervical MRI (also noted LUE weakness), nerve conduction studies, EMG
   and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. No evidence for PE, but
   mismatch would account for poor ventilation/oxygenation on given vent
   settings. Given extensive smoking history and unusually large minute
   volume for CO2 ventilation, likely smoking-related changes, perhaps
   vascular.  CK is quite elevated also.  MRA brain, MRI (w/ gad) cervical
   cord and roots and Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies pending.
   - Repeat NIF
   - Recheck CK
   - Trial PSV again this afternoon
   - Allow CO2 to drift up given that he likely retains at baseline
   - Continue ceftriaxone until [**2117-1-9**] (levofloxacin stopped)
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status (at
   least when off proprofol. HSV negative by PCR (CSF).
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason)
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and one week of hypersomnolence progressing to stupor. He was found in hypercarbic respiratory failure and also had an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) that is now stable. The patient's symptoms, along with imaging results, suggest a possible neurologic presentation secondary to respiratory failure. Other potential causes include peripheral nervous system disorders or a vascular event. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but his neurologic condition requires further evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is characterized by an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream due to inadequate ventilation. This condition can lead to increased acidity in the blood (acidosis), affecting various organ functions.
2. Neurologic Complications: Given the patient's altered mental status, leaning to one side, and MRI findings of diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons, there is a possibility of neurologic complications such as stroke or encephalopathy.
3. Peripheral Nervous System Disorders: The patient's generalized weakness and low negative inspiratory force (NIF) may indicate a peripheral nervous system disorder, potentially causing muscle weakness and respiratory compromise.
4. Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient experienced an acute myocardial infar"

   Assessment and Plan
    61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view
   of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic presentation may have
   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Patient has not tolerated low levels of pressure support. Transitioned
   back to AC this AM.   NIF last done two days ago
 was -12.  Will
   repeat. Investigation of neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume
   [**Location (un) **] or mysasthenia (although weak, does not appear fatigable on
   physical exam).  Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar
   arterial insufficiency.  Unclear at this point whether primarily
   respiratory, peripheral nervous or central etiology. MRA brain, MRI (w/
   gad) cervical cord and roots and Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
   pending.  Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible
   PNA contributing to complete ceftriaxone d7 on [**1-9**], completed 5 d of
   levo yesterday. Still copious secretions overnight. No meaningful
   improvement with lasix.
   - Repeat NIF today and follow.
   - Maintain pressure support 14/8 today.
   - Allow CO2 to drift up given that he likely retains at baseline
   - Last day ceftriaxone today.
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Repeat Lasix 20 m.g with goal to be even, with respect to Is & Os, or
   slightly negative today.
   Fever
   Patient with low grade fever overnight. Would consider VAP, however no
   new infiltrate on cxr. Other consideration include UTI, Line infection.
   - Blood cultures
   - Urinalysis and Culture
   - LFTs
   - If spikes/decompensate will cover for VAP
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. HSV negative by PCR (CSF).
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.

   Assessment and Plan
    61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view
   of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic presentation may have
   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Changed back to AC yesterday given desynchony of respiratory effort and
   ventilator.  Saturation worsened slightly yesterday and PEEP increased
   to 8 to maintain sat O2 at 90-92, but spontaneously improved to 95%
   around midnight.  NIF last done two days ago
 was -12.  Will repeat.
   Investigation of neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or
   mysasthenia (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical
   exam).  Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency.  Unclear at this point whether primarily respiratory,
   peripheral nervous or central etiology. MRA brain, MRI (w/ gad)
   cervical cord and roots and Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
   pending.  Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible
   PNA contributing to complete ceftriaxone d7 on [**1-9**], completed 5 d of
   levo yesterday. Still copious secretions that did not improve with
   diuresis.  On the other hand, improved respiratory status did occur
   after diuresis, suggesting pulmonary edema may have some role.
   - Repeat NIF
   - Back to PSV now more stable [**12-11**]
   - Reduce PEEP again to 5
   - Allow CO2 to drift up given that he likely retains at baseline
   - Continue ceftriaxone until [**2117-1-9**] (levofloxacin stopped)
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Repeat Lasix 20 m.g with goal to be even, with respect to Is & Os, or
   slightly negative today.
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. HSV negative by PCR (CSF).
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), one week of hypersomnolence progressing to stupor, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to Sao2 < 90% and RR > 35. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate (HR) of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 115/63 mmHg to 130/101 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count within normal range, hemoglobin (Hb) of 15.6 g/dL, blood glucose level of 142 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 142 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 99 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) level of 8.0 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphorus (PO4) level of 3.4 mg/dL. 

The patient's MRI cervical spine and MRA brain are pending. 

The patient's assessment and plan include suspected hypercarbic respiratory failure/pneumonia, possible neurologic presentation secondary to respiratory failure, consideration of peripheral nervous system (PNS) cause, investigation of Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis, and evaluation for vertebrobasilar arterial insufficiency. 

The patient's medications include propofol infusion, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), ceftriaxone, albuterol nebs, metoprolol, statin, ASA, and ACEI on discharge. 

The patient's disposition is to continue ICU care pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
    61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view
   of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic presentation may have
   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Patient has not tolerated low levels of pressure support. Transitioned
   back to AC this AM.   NIF last done two days ago
 was -12.  Will
   repeat. Investigation of neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume
   [**Location (un) **] or mysasthenia (although weak, does not appear fatigable on
   physical exam).  Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar
   arterial insufficiency.  Unclear at this point whether primarily
   respiratory, peripheral nervous or central etiology. MRA brain, MRI (w/
   gad) cervical cord and roots and Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
   pending.  Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible
   PNA contributing to complete ceftriaxone d7 on [**1-9**], completed 5 d of
   levo yesterday. Still copious secretions overnight. No meaningful
   improvement with lasix.
   - Repeat NIF today and follow.
   - Maintain pressure support 14/8 today.
   - Allow CO2 to drift up given that he likely retains at baseline
   - Last day ceftriaxone today.
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Repeat Lasix 20 m.g with goal to be even, with respect to Is & Os, or
   slightly negative today.
   Fever
   Patient with low grade fever overnight. Would consider VAP, however no
   new infiltrate on cxr. Other consideration include UTI, Line infection.
   - Blood cultures
   - Urinalysis and Culture
   - LFTs
   - If spikes/decompensate will cover for VAP
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. HSV negative by PCR (CSF).
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 61M HTN, OSA p/w hypercarbic respiratory
   failure and NSTEMI.  He continues to have sig secretions, unchanged
   over past days. Diuresed with lasix.   Fatigued on PS/Peep 5 rested on
   ACV overnight.  Now back on PS.

   low nifs and diffuse weakness on exam concerning for NM or central
   process (? MG, ALS, cerebral-basilar insuff) which we are working up.
   Neurology input appreciated.  Will f/u brain and c-spine MRI. Nerve
   conduction studies, emg and  acetylcholine receptor levels are ordered,
   we will follow NIF and neuro examination, CPKs, and supp phos/lytes as
   needed. Will continue current support, resting on ACV overnight. Will
   continue gentle diuresis, continue MDIs, and complete  treatment
   for presumptive pneumonia, now s/p levo day [**5-11**], continuing ctx day
   [**7-13**]. He continues to have copious secretions, unchanged, with no focal
   infiltrate on increase in FIO2. He now has low grade temps. Will
   perform fever work-up, send sputum, blood, urine, lfts, c diff,
   consider lenis and changing out picc.  Low threshold to cover for
   VAP/tracheobronchitis. In terms of recent NSTEMI, remains stable on

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and one week of progressive hypersomnolence leading to stupor. He was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is intubated on assist-control ventilation (ACV) with pressure support ventilation (PSV). His vital signs include a temperature of 100.3°F, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation between 93-98% on PSV. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds, trace pedal edema, and improved scrotal edema. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7K, hematocrit of 49%, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 36 mmHg, and creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. The patient has pending brain and cervical spine MRI, and nerve conduction studies, electromyography (EMG), and acetylcholine receptor levels are ordered. The patient's plan includes continuing PSV, monitoring neurologic examination and NIF (negative inspiratory force), resting on ACV overnight, gentle diures"

   STUDY: AP chest [**2118-1-9**]:
   HISTORY: 61-year-old man with hypercarbic respiratory failure. Evaluate
   for
   interval change.
   FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from [**2118-1-7**].
   The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left-sided PICC line are
   unchanged in position. There has been improvement of the left
   retrocardiac
   opacity. The left base is partially excluded on the field of view.
   There are
   no signs for overt pulmonary edema and the right lung field is clear.
   MRA
   Limited MRA due to motion artifact. This is particularly
   limiting evaluation of the distal vertebral arteries and the
   vertebrobasilar
   junction. Although there has been no definite change since the CTA of
   [**1-1**], the poor quality of the MRA limits characterization of the
   vertebrals or basilar artery.
   Our read - slightly tortuous rostral portion of vertebral arteries but
   difficult to evaluate. Basilar well filled.
   Microbiology: [**2118-1-9**]  BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING
   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. PNA also likely based on CXR and
   presentation (febrile, copious secretions, no other sites of infection
   evident).
   During the stay the patient has been switching between AC and PSV
   ventilation
 due to desynchrony with ventilator and tachypneic
   episodes.  Attempts to reduce pressure support typically result in
   tachypnea to the 30s-40s.  Now this is attended by relatively normal
   (we think) blood gases for him
 we expect that his PPCO2 is typically
   58-62 mmHg at baseline (a guess). The etiology is unclear, but it is
   important to note that he suffers from untreated OSA, about 120
   pack-year history of smoking, HTN, polycythemia (perhaps due to chronic
   hypoxia or maybe primary), PNA and apparently abnormal respiratory
   drive
 in response to hypoxia or reduced pressure support he becomes
   tachypneic with low tidal volumes.  We wonder if this might be
   neurologic, perhaps due to an insult sometime prior to admission with
   gradual decompensation and PNA
 this is consistent with his history
   prior to admission.  We also wonder if this may correlate with
   increased pontine signal on MRI.  Peripheral causes such as ALS,
   myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and Guillaume [**Location (un) **] are unlikely based on no
   fasciculations, normal muscle bulk, the absence of fatigability and the
   presence of reflexes.  Neurology are following.  Based on previous echo
   he does not have pulmonary hypertension and only has a trace of heart
   failure on clinical exam without much improvement of breathing after
   diuresis.  NIF gradually increasing and
 26 cm H2O today.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Patient has not tolerated low levels of pressure support, with
   tachypnea as above. NIF now -26 cmH2O. Still unclear etiology.  PNA and
   OSA, with central hypoventilation. Transitioned back to AC this
   yesterday now back to pressure support.   Investigation of
   neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or mysasthenia
   incomplete (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical exam,
   but AChR antibody still pending), but may be unwarranted as described
   above. Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency and MRA somewhat inconclusive. Left arm movement much
   improved
 reason for cervical MRI. Unclear at this point whether
   primarily respiratory, peripheral nervous or central etiology, but
   appears likely to be both primary respiratory with central component at
   present. . Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible
   PNA contributing, now completed ceftriaxone and levo. No meaningful
   improvement with lasix so far.
   - Follow NIF
   - Appreciate Neurology input
   - Neurology want to hold on NCS/EMG given new exam now less sedated
   - Work towards trial of extubation (rather than maintaining trach and
   needing tracheostomy)
   - Maintain pressure support (reduce gradually and consider AC each
   night - is that the pattern?)
   - Allow CO2 around 58-62 mmHg
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Lasix 20 m.g with goal to be even to down slightly (but also
   consider phlebotomy to keep viscosity lower).
   - Will allow period of tachypnea on [**5-11**] today and check ABG
   Transaminitis
   Possible statin or propofol
   - Stop statin for now
   - Follow
   Fever
   Still near febrile 100.3. Patient with low grade fever overnight. Would
   consider VAP, however no new infiltrate on CXR. Other consideration
   include UTI, line infection.
   - Blood cultures
   - Urinalysis and Culture
   - LFTs
   - Daily CXR depending on exam findings
   - If spikes/decompensate will cover for VAP
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. Possible contribution as pseudobulbar affect and
   in context of gliosis/vascular lesion in pons. [**Month (only) 51**] also have caused
   somnolence prior to presentation.
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.
   Constipation
   - Increase bowel regimen to standing Colace/senna with holding
   parameter, rather than PRN.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. Respiratory parameters also
   consistent with increased dead-space. The etiology is unclear, but MRI
   is only consistent with a vascular event more than one week ago
   (nothing seen on diffusion) and a vascular event is not really
   consistent with the history. We now consider this less likely in view
   of his recovery and suspect that his neurologic presentation may have
   been secondary to respiratory failure. On the other hand, peripheral
   nervous system causes also need to be considered given generalized
   weakness on exam (unclear if effort related) and very low NIF of -12 to
   -17 cmH2O.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Patient has not tolerated low levels of pressure support. NIF now -24
   cmH2O. Still unclear etiology.  Possible hyperviscosity with pumonary
   hypertension, COPD with increased alveolar wall tension on ventilator
   further affecting pulmonary pressure.  PNA and OSA, with OSA likely
   further exacerbating pumonary hypertension. Transitioned back to AC
   this yesterday now back to pressure support.   Investigation of
   neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or mysasthenia
   incomplete (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical exam,
   but AChR antibody still pending).  Neurology also raised possibility of
   vertebrobasilar arterial insufficiency and MRA somewhat inconclusive.
   Left arm movement much improved - unclear if nsufficiency or
   effort-related in context of sedation.  Unclear at this point whether
   primarily respiratory, peripheral nervous or central etiology. Likely
   smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible PNA contributing to
   complete ceftriaxone d7 on [**1-9**], completed 5 d of levo. Still copious
   secretions overnight. No meaningful improvement with lasix so far.
   - Follow NIF
   - Maintain pressure support (reduce gradually and consider AC each
   night - is that the pattern?)
   - Allow CO2 around 58-62 mmHg
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Lasix 20 m.g with goal to be even to down slightly (but also
   consider phlebotomy to keep viscosity lower).
   Fever
   Still near febrile 100.3. Patient with low grade fever overnight. Would
   consider VAP, however no new infiltrate on cxr. Other consideration
   include UTI, Line infection.
   - Blood cultures
   - Urinalysis and Culture

   Sputum Culture: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. PNA also likely based on CXR and
   presentation (febrile, copious secretions, no other sites of infection
   evident).
   During the stay the patient has been switching between AC and PSV
   ventilation
 due to desynchrony with ventilator and tachypneic
   episodes.  Attempts to reduce pressure support typically result in
   tachypnea to the 30s-40s.  Now this is attended by relatively normal
   (we think) blood gases for him
 we expect that his PPCO2 is typically
   58-62 mmHg at baseline (a guess). The etiology is unclear, but it is
   important to note that he suffers from untreated OSA, about 120
   pack-year history of smoking, HTN, polycythemia (perhaps due to chronic
   hypoxia or maybe primary), PNA and apparently abnormal respiratory
   drive
 in response to hypoxia or reduced pressure support he becomes
   tachypneic with low tidal volumes.  We wonder if this might be
   neurologic, perhaps due to an insult sometime prior to admission with
   gradual decompensation and PNA
 this is consistent with his history
   prior to admission.  We also wonder if this may correlate with
   increased pontine signal on MRI.  Peripheral causes such as ALS,
   myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and Guillaume [**Location (un) **] are unlikely based on no
   fasciculations, normal muscle bulk, the absence of fatigability and the
   presence of reflexes.  Neurology are following.  Based on previous echo
   he does not have pulmonary hypertension and only has a trace of heart
   failure on clinical exam without much improvement of breathing after
   diuresis.  NIF gradually increasing and
 26 cm H2O today.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Patient has not tolerated low levels of pressure support, with
   tachypnea as above. NIF now -26 cmH2O. Still unclear etiology.  PNA and
   OSA, with central hypoventilation. Transitioned back to AC this
   yesterday now back to pressure support.   Investigation of
   neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or mysasthenia
   incomplete (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical exam,
   but AChR antibody still pending), but may be unwarranted as described
   above. Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency and MRA somewhat inconclusive. Left arm movement much
   improved
 reason for cervical MRI. Unclear at this point whether
   primarily respiratory, peripheral nervous or central etiology, but
   appears likely to be both primary respiratory with central component at
   present. . Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible
   PNA contributing, now completed ceftriaxone and levo. No meaningful
   improvement with lasix so far.
   - Follow NIF
   - Appreciate Neurology input
   - Neurology want to hold on NCS/EMG given new exam now less sedated
   - Work towards trial of extubation (rather than maintaining trach and
   needing tracheostomy)
   - Maintain pressure support (reduce gradually and consider AC each
   night - is that the pattern?)
   - Allow CO2 around 58-62 mmHg
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Lasix 20 m.g with goal to be even to down slightly (but also
   consider phlebotomy to keep viscosity lower).
   - Will allow period of tachypnea on [**5-11**] today and check ABG
   Transaminitis
   Possible statin or propofol
   - Stop statin for now
   - Follow
   Fever
   Still near febrile 100.3. Patient with low grade fever overnight. Would
   consider VAP, however no new infiltrate on CXR. Other consideration
   include UTI, line infection.
   - Blood cultures
   - Urinalysis and Culture
   - LFTs
   - Daily CXR depending on exam findings
   - If spikes/decompensate will cover for VAP
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. Possible contribution as pseudobulbar affect and
   in context of gliosis/vascular lesion in pons. [**Month (only) 51**] also have caused
   somnolence prior to presentation.
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.
   Constipation
   - Increase bowel regimen to standing Colace/senna with holding
   parameter, rather than PRN.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a significant smoking history presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and pneumonia. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement followed by tachypneic episodes. He has been switched between assist-control (AC) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to desynchrony with the ventilator.

Neurological examination reveals perplexed and slightly euphoric behavior, spontaneous movement but largely not purposeful, intact cranial nerves, normal muscle bulk, tone, and reflexes. The patient's MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons. The etiology of the hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be related to central hypoventilation, possibly due to an insult prior to admission or an underlying neurological condition such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis.

Other findings include fever, resolved rash, elevated troponin levels, and evidence of congestive heart failure. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and he is receiving tube feeds. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and famotidine. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one week of hypersomnolence, progressing
   to stupor. Hypercarbic respiratory failure noted on arrival, along with
   NSTEMI
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient had been
   leaning to the right for that week. MRI shows diffuse disease including
   subcortical white matter and pons. PNA also likely based on CXR and
   presentation (febrile, copious secretions, no other sites of infection
   evident).
   During the stay the patient has been switching between AC and PSV
   ventilation
 due to desynchrony with ventilator and tachypneic
   episodes.  Attempts to reduce pressure support typically result in
   tachypnea to the 30s-40s.  Now this is attended by relatively normal
   (we think) blood gases for him
 we expect that his PPCO2 is typically
   58-62 mmHg at baseline (a guess). The etiology is unclear, but it is
   important to note that he suffers from untreated OSA, about 120
   pack-year history of smoking, HTN, polycythemia (perhaps due to chronic
   hypoxia or maybe primary), PNA and apparently abnormal respiratory
   drive
 in response to hypoxia or reduced pressure support he becomes
   tachypneic with low tidal volumes.  We wonder if this might be
   neurologic, perhaps due to an insult sometime prior to admission with
   gradual decompensation and PNA
 this is consistent with his history
   prior to admission.  We also wonder if this may correlate with
   increased pontine signal on MRI.  Peripheral causes such as ALS,
   myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] and Guillaume [**Location (un) **] are unlikely based on no
   fasciculations, normal muscle bulk, the absence of fatigability and the
   presence of reflexes.  Neurology are following.  Based on previous echo
   he does not have pulmonary hypertension and only has a trace of heart
   failure on clinical exam without much improvement of breathing after
   diuresis.  NIF gradually increasing and
 26 cm H2O today.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Patient has not tolerated low levels of pressure support, with
   tachypnea as above. NIF now -26 cmH2O. Still unclear etiology.  PNA and
   OSA, with central hypoventilation. Transitioned back to AC this
   yesterday now back to pressure support.   Investigation of
   neuromuscular or PNS cause such as Guillaume [**Location (un) **] or mysasthenia
   incomplete (although weak, does not appear fatigable on physical exam,
   but AChR antibody still pending), but may be unwarranted as described
   above. Neurology also raised possibility of vertebrobasilar arterial
   insufficiency and MRA somewhat inconclusive. Left arm movement much
   improved
 reason for cervical MRI. Unclear at this point whether
   primarily respiratory, peripheral nervous or central etiology, but
   appears likely to be both primary respiratory with central component at
   present. . Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA, possible
   PNA contributing, now completed ceftriaxone and levo. No meaningful
   improvement with lasix so far.
   - Follow NIF
   - Appreciate Neurology input
   - Neurology want to hold on NCS/EMG given new exam now less sedated
   - Work towards trial of extubation (rather than maintaining trach and
   needing tracheostomy)
   - Maintain pressure support (reduce gradually and consider AC each
   night - is that the pattern?)
   - Allow CO2 around 58-62 mmHg
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Lasix 20 m.g with goal to be even to down slightly (but also
   consider phlebotomy to keep viscosity lower).
   - Will allow period of tachypnea on [**5-11**] today and check ABG
   Transaminitis
   Possible statin or propofol
   - Stop statin for now
   - Follow
   Fever
   Still near febrile 100.3. Patient with low grade fever overnight. Would
   consider VAP, however no new infiltrate on CXR. Other consideration
   include UTI, line infection.
   - Blood cultures
   - Urinalysis and Culture
   - LFTs
   - Daily CXR depending on exam findings
   - If spikes/decompensate will cover for VAP
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. Possible contribution as pseudobulbar affect and
   in context of gliosis/vascular lesion in pons. [**Month (only) 51**] also have caused
   somnolence prior to presentation.
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolving. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin and ASA
   - Consider ACEI
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.
   Constipation
   - Increase bowel regimen to standing Colace/senna with holding
   parameter, rather than PRN.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a significant smoking history presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. 

The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, with episodes of desynchrony and tachypnea when attempts are made to reduce pressure support. The NIF (negative inspiratory force) is gradually increasing, indicating improved respiratory muscle strength. 

The patient's MRI shows diffuse disease including subcortical white matter and pons, which may be related to the central hypoventilation. There is also evidence of chronic lung disease and prior brain abnormalities. 

Neurologic causes such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis (MG), and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) are less likely based on the physical examination findings. 

The patient's fever has been near febrile, and there is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or a urinary tract infection (UTI). Blood cultures, urinalysis, and cultures have been ordered. 

The patient has a history of untreated OSA, polycythemia (likely due to chronic hypoxia or primary), hypertension, and smoking-related lung injury. The polycythemia is likely related to COPD/OSA.

","The patient's chief complaint includes somnolence, decreased activity tolerance, and shortness of breath. The patient was presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure, reduced level of consciousness, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

During the 24-hour period, the patient was extubated after a successful spontaneous breathing trial. A speech and swallow consult was initiated following extubation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) after extubation was unremarkable. A healthcare proxy was clarified with the patient. 

The neurology assessment mentioned that the patient does not have any upper extremity weakness today but cannot rule out isolated diaphragmatic weakness related to a variant of Parsonage-Turner syndrome (brachial plexitis). It was recommended to perform inspiratory and expiratory chest X-ray or other means of assessing for diaphragmatic weakness once the patient is more stable. This request has been made for the chest X-ray film on [**1-12**] AM. The ordered bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) was held overnight as the patient was resting comfortably and saturating well.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics, ceftriaxone, was given on [**2118-1-9**] at 03:26 PM. The patient is receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) since [**2118-1-12**] at 06:19 AM. 

The patient reported feeling ""off"" with increased difficulty breathing and sleepiness for about one month prior to presentation. The presentation was reluctant and eventuated by family. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 88 bpm (80-99), blood pressure of 132/84 mmHg (96/40-179/92), respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (18-31), and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 78.8 kg (admission weight: 83 kg). 

The fluid balance shows a total input of 982 mL since [**20**] AM, with 520 mL of PO intake, 392 mL of TF intake, 440 mL of IVF intake, and 190 mL of IVF output. The total output includes 2,115 mL of urine output and 478 mL of NG output. The respiratory support shows an oxygen delivery device of nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 93%. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PCO2 of 61 mmHg, PO2 of 150 mmHg, and HCO3- of 75 mmol/L. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 150.

The physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one month of increased tiredness, reduced
   activity tolerance and shortness of breath, eventually presenting, at
   the urging of family, with hypercarbic respiratory failure and stupor.
   NSTEMI on arrival
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient
   had been leaning to the right for a week. MRI shows diffuse disease
   including subcortical white matter and pons. PNA also likely based on
   CXR and presentation (febrile, copious secretions, no other sites of
   infection evident). The etiology of respiratory failure and low NIFs is
   still unclear, but Neurology have suggested Parsonage-[**Doctor Last Name **] brachial
   plexopathy with diaphragmatic involvement.  He has been successfully
   extubated, but was 86% on nasal [**Last Name (un) 866**] at 5 L this morning.  Therefore
   still on facemask and to be called out to floor.
   Brief Hospital Course (MICU)
   During the stay the patient has been switching between AC and PSV
   ventilation
 due to desynchrony with ventilator and tachypneic
   episodes.  Attempts to reduce pressure support typically result in
   tachypnea to the 30s-40s. Based on bicarbonate at admission, his ppCO2
   at baseline is likely 20 mmHg above the normal range or 55-65 mmHg.
   The etiology of his decompensation is unclear, but it is important to
   note that he suffers from untreated OSA, about 120 pack-year history of
   smoking, HTN, polycythemia (perhaps due to chronic hypoxia or maybe
   primary), PNA and apparently abnormal respiratory drive
 in response
   to hypoxia or reduced pressure support he becomes tachypneic with low
   tidal volumes.  In addition to this, he may have had some diaphragmatic
   weakness. Based on previous echo he does not have pulmonary
   hypertension and only has a trace of heart failure on clinical exam
   without much improvement of breathing after diuresis.  Last NIF while
   intubated was
 26 cm H2O. We have decided not to repeat this. An
   inspiratory/expiratory CXR was ordered but the patient did not perform
   the needed respiratory maneuvers. We decided not to repeat because his
   other chest x-rays have been quite nice inspiratory films, suggesting
   that if the diaphragm is weak, we may not see it this way. PNA was
   quite possible based on thick secretions, cough, but CXRs are now clear
   and sputum examination has not been fruitful.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Breathing is improved. Although still requiring supplemental O2 he is
   now extubated. Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA,
   possible PNA contributing, now completed ceftriaxone and levo. No
   meaningful improvement with lasix so far, but continuing given likely
   volume increase during admission
 last dose today. Neurology have
   suggested that a weakened diaphragm from Parsonage-[**Doctor Last Name **] brachial
   plexopathy as a possible contributor, having ruled out myasthenia
   [**Last Name (un) **], ALS, Guillian-[**Location (un) **] and thinking other causes unlikely.
   - Permissive CO2 around 58-62 mmHg
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Last dose Lasix 10 m.g IV with goal to be even to down slightly
   - Continue mask and trials of nasal cannula
   OSA
   Treated with autotitrating CPAP last night.  This should continue with
   education and continuance at home.
   - Continue pressure support with mask at night.
   Transaminitis
   Possible statin or Propofol, the former more likely. Statins held and
   now all trending down. Not a complete contraindication, therefore
   restarting lower dose (which can still be of benefit)
   - Statin 10 mg (80 mg started on admission)
   - Follow
   Fever
   Still slightly warm, but no positive cultures nor other obvious site of
   infection. Unlikely VAP.
   - Follow cultures but no more for now
   - CXR depending on exam findings
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. [**Month (only) 51**] have been purely secondary to respiratory
   failure. Good to keep in mind unlikely contribution of brainstem
   Binswanger disease but presentation somewhat indolent.
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolved. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin (now 10mg) and ASA (reduce from 325 to 81 mg)
   - Consider ACEI/Ca channel antagonist if needed subsequently
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.
   Constipation
   Resolved and in fact stool was loose.
   - Continue colace/senna

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a significant smoking history. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, reduced level of consciousness, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has shown improvement in his respiratory status, now able to breathe without assistance. However, he still requires supplemental oxygen. The etiology of his respiratory failure and low tidal volumes is unclear, but potential causes include untreated OSA, smoking-related lung injury, and possible pneumonia (PNA). Neurological evaluation suggests a weakened diaphragm from Parsonage-Brachial plexopathy as a possible contributor. The patient's lethargy and altered mental status are resolving with improvement of respiratory status and weaning of sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is characterized by an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream due to inadequate ventilation. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and may result in symptoms such as confusion, drowsiness, and eventually coma if left untreated.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's presentation included symptoms consistent with pneumonia, such as cough and copious secretions. Although initial chest X-rays showed clear findings, the possibility of PNA cannot be completely ruled out.
3. Diaphragmatic Weakness"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a significant smoking history. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, stupor, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient also had diffuse neurological disease including subcortical white matter and pons, and pneumonia (PNA) likely due to an infection.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient switched between assisted controlled (AC) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to desynchrony with the ventilator and tachypneic episodes. His baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide (ppCO2) is likely elevated at 55-65 mmHg. The cause of his decompensation is unclear, but it could be attributed to untreated OSA, smoking history, hypertension, polycythemia, PNA, and possibly diaphragmatic weakness.

The patient was extubated successfully but required supplemental oxygen. He has been treated with autotitrating CPAP for OSA, which should continue with education for home use. His fever has resolved, and there are no positive cultures or other obvious site of infection. The transaminitis is likely related to statin use, which has been held and is now trending down. The patient's lethargy and altered mental status are improving with the improvement of respiratory status and weaning of sedation.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one month of increased tiredness, reduced
   activity tolerance and shortness of breath, eventually presenting, at
   the urging of family, with hypercarbic respiratory failure and stupor.
   NSTEMI on arrival
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient
   had been leaning to the right for a week. MRI shows diffuse disease
   including subcortical white matter and pons. PNA also likely based on
   CXR and presentation (febrile, copious secretions, no other sites of
   infection evident). The etiology of respiratory failure and low NIFs is
   still unclear, but Neurology have suggested Parsonage-[**Doctor Last Name **] brachial
   plexopathy with diaphragmatic involvement.  He has been successfully
   extubated, but was 86% on nasal [**Last Name (un) 866**] at 5 L yesterday. In view of
   target O2 of 88-92 %, successfully on nasal cannula now at 5 L and
   around 90% O2Sat.
   Brief Hospital Course (MICU)
   During the stay the patient has been switching between AC and PSV
   ventilation
 due to desynchrony with ventilator and tachypneic
   episodes.  Attempts to reduce pressure support typically resulted in
   tachypnea to the 30s-40s. Based on bicarbonate at admission, his ppCO2
   at baseline is likely 20 mmHg above the normal range or 55-65 mmHg.
   The etiology of his decompensation is unclear, but it is important to
   note that he suffers from untreated OSA, about 120 pack-year history of
   smoking, HTN, polycythemia (perhaps due to chronic hypoxia or maybe
   primary), PNA and apparently abnormal respiratory drive
 in response
   to hypoxia or reduced pressure support he becomes tachypneic with low
   tidal volumes.  In addition to this, he may have had some diaphragmatic
   weakness. Based on previous echo he does not have pulmonary
   hypertension and only has a trace of heart failure on clinical exam
   without much improvement of breathing after diuresis.  Last NIF while
   intubated was
 26 cm H2O. We have decided not to repeat this. An
   inspiratory/expiratory CXR was ordered but the patient did not perform
   the needed respiratory maneuvers. We decided not to repeat because his
   other chest x-rays have been quite nice inspiratory films, suggesting
   that if the diaphragm is weak, we may not see it this way. PNA was
   quite possible based on thick secretions, cough, but CXRs are now clear
   and sputum examination has not been fruitful.
   Today he is comfortable, although weak (likely from extended
   prostration), on nasal cannula at 5L. We think that COPD has been a
   likely contributor in addition to the above, despite relatively
   unimpressive emphysema on CT.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Breathing is improved. Although still requiring supplemental O2 he is
   now extubated and comfortable on nasal cannula. Likely smoking-related
   lung injury and known OSA, possible PNA contributing, now completed
   ceftriaxone and levo. No meaningful improvement with lasix so far
   although has corrected volume status. Neurology have suggested that a
   weakened diaphragm from Parsonage-[**Doctor Last Name **] brachial plexopathy as a
   possible contributor but effectively ruled-out neuromuscular causes
   including myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **], ALS, Guillian-[**Location (un) **] and thinking other
   causes unlikely.
   - Permissive CO2 around 58-62 mmHg and O2 88-92%
   - Stop nebs, but start Advair,
   - Last dose Lasix 10 m.g IV with goal to be even to down slightly
   - Continue mask and trials of nasal cannula
   OSA

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and one month of increased tiredness, reduced activity tolerance, and shortness of breath. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and stupor, and was found to have NSTEMI upon arrival. The patient's symptoms are consistent with COPD, PNA (pneumonia), and possibly a weakened diaphragm from Parsonage-Brachial Plexopathy.

The patient's current condition is stable, although weak. He is extubated and comfortable on a nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen. His breathing has improved, and he is no longer requiring mechanical ventilation. The etiology of his respiratory failure and low NIFs (negative inspiratory forces) remains unclear, but neurology suggests Parsonage-Brachial Plexopathy with diaphragmatic involvement.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, NSTEMI, transaminitis, fever, lethargy/altered mental status, rash, elevated troponin/ECG changes, polycythemia, constipation, and COPD. He is being treated for these conditions with various medications, including Heparin sodium, statins, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and others.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one month of increased tiredness, reduced
   activity tolerance and shortness of breath, eventually presenting, at
   the urging of family, with hypercarbic respiratory failure and stupor.
   NSTEMI on arrival
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient
   had been leaning to the right for a week. MRI shows diffuse disease
   including subcortical white matter and pons. PNA also likely based on
   CXR and presentation (febrile, copious secretions, no other sites of
   infection evident). The etiology of respiratory failure and low NIFs is
   still unclear, but Neurology have suggested Parsonage-[**Doctor Last Name **] brachial
   plexopathy with diaphragmatic involvement.  He has been successfully
   extubated, but was 86% on nasal [**Last Name (un) 866**] at 5 L yesterday. In view of
   target O2 of 88-92 %, successfully on nasal cannula now at 5 L and
   around 90% O2Sat.
   Brief Hospital Course (MICU)
   During the stay the patient has been switching between AC and PSV
   ventilation
 due to desynchrony with ventilator and tachypneic
   episodes.  Attempts to reduce pressure support typically resulted in
   tachypnea to the 30s-40s. Based on bicarbonate at admission, his ppCO2
   at baseline is likely 20 mmHg above the normal range or 55-65 mmHg.
   The etiology of his decompensation is unclear, but it is important to
   note that he suffers from untreated OSA, about 120 pack-year history of
   smoking, HTN, polycythemia (perhaps due to chronic hypoxia or maybe
   primary), PNA and apparently abnormal respiratory drive
 in response
   to hypoxia or reduced pressure support he becomes tachypneic with low
   tidal volumes.  In addition to this, he may have had some diaphragmatic
   weakness. Based on previous echo he does not have pulmonary
   hypertension and only has a trace of heart failure on clinical exam
   without much improvement of breathing after diuresis.  Last NIF while
   intubated was
 26 cm H2O. We have decided not to repeat this. An
   inspiratory/expiratory CXR was ordered but the patient did not perform
   the needed respiratory maneuvers. We decided not to repeat because his
   other chest x-rays have been quite nice inspiratory films, suggesting
   that if the diaphragm is weak, we may not see it this way. PNA was
   quite possible based on thick secretions, cough, but CXRs are now clear
   and sputum examination has not been fruitful.
   Today he is comfortable, although weak (likely from extended
   prostration), on nasal cannula at 5L. We think that COPD has been a
   likely contributor in addition to the above, despite relatively
   unimpressive emphysema on CT.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Breathing is improved. Although still requiring supplemental O2 he is
   now extubated and comfortable on nasal cannula. Likely smoking-related
   lung injury and known OSA, possible PNA contributing, now completed
   ceftriaxone and levo. No meaningful improvement with lasix so far
   although has corrected volume status. Neurology have suggested that a
   weakened diaphragm from Parsonage-[**Doctor Last Name **] brachial plexopathy as a
   possible contributor but effectively ruled-out neuromuscular causes
   including myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **], ALS, Guillian-[**Location (un) **] and thinking other
   causes unlikely.
   - Permissive CO2 around 58-62 mmHg and O2 88-92%
   - Stop nebs, but start Advair, albuterol for likely COPD
   - Continue nasal cannula for now
   OSA
   Treated with autoset CPAP last night.  This should continue with
   education and continuance at home.
   - Continue pressure support with mask at night.
   - Sleep Medicine outpatient follow-up (recommend in DC summary given
   lives in [**State 3421**])
   - PFTs and DLCO as outpatient after recovery from acute event (as
   above)
   Transaminitis
   Likely statin related. Low dose statin restarted. Not a complete
   contraindication, therefore on lower dose (which can still be of
   benefit)
   - Statin 10 mg (80 mg started on admission)
   - Follow
   Fever
   No fever now; No positive cultures nor other obvious site of infection.
   Unlikely VAP.
   - Follow cultures but no more for now
   - CXR depending on exam findings
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Has resolved with weaning of sedation. [**Month (only) 51**] have been purely secondary
   to respiratory failure. Good to keep in mind unlikely contribution of
   brainstem Binswanger disease but presentation somewhat indolent.
   Nonetheless may make patient more sensitive to anesthetic.
   Rash
   Resolved. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem. [**Doctor Last Name 121**] responsible not clear.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Increase metoprolol to 50 TID
   - Statin (10mg) and ASA (81 mg)
   - Consider ACEI/Ca channel antagonist if needed subsequently
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.
   Constipation
   Resolved and in fact stool was loose.
   - Continue colace/senna

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a one-month increase in tiredness, reduced activity tolerance, and shortness of breath. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, reduced level of consciousness, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and COPD, and there is a suggestion of diaphragmatic weakness from Parsonage-Berlinguet brachial plexopathy. His respiratory failure is attributed to untreated OSA, smoking-related lung injury, and possible PNA. The patient's lethargy and altered mental status have resolved with weaning of sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient has shown improvement in breathing but still requires supplemental oxygen. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory function and provide appropriate treatment to prevent further complications.
2. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient's untreated OSA contributes to his respiratory issues. It is crucial to educate the patient about the importance of using CPAP therapy at home and provide recommendations for follow-up with a sleep medicine specialist.
3. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's elevated troponin levels and ECG changes indicate a stable NSTEMI. Ongoing cardiac monitoring and medication"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with HTN, untreated OSA, one month of increased tiredness, reduced
   activity tolerance and shortness of breath, eventually presenting, at
   the urging of family, with hypercarbic respiratory failure and stupor.
   NSTEMI on arrival
 now stable. Family also reported that the patient
   had been leaning to the right for a week. MRI shows diffuse disease
   including subcortical white matter and pons. PNA also likely based on
   CXR and presentation (febrile, copious secretions, no other sites of
   infection evident). The etiology of respiratory failure and low NIFs is
   still unclear, but Neurology have suggested Parsonage-[**Doctor Last Name **] brachial
   plexopathy with diaphragmatic involvement.  He has been successfully
   extubated, but was 86% on nasal [**Last Name (un) 866**] at 5 L this morning.  Therefore
   still on facemask and to be called out to floor.
   Brief Hospital Course (MICU)
   During the stay the patient has been switching between AC and PSV
   ventilation
 due to desynchrony with ventilator and tachypneic
   episodes.  Attempts to reduce pressure support typically result in
   tachypnea to the 30s-40s. Based on bicarbonate at admission, his ppCO2
   at baseline is likely 20 mmHg above the normal range or 55-65 mmHg.
   The etiology of his decompensation is unclear, but it is important to
   note that he suffers from untreated OSA, about 120 pack-year history of
   smoking, HTN, polycythemia (perhaps due to chronic hypoxia or maybe
   primary), PNA and apparently abnormal respiratory drive
 in response
   to hypoxia or reduced pressure support he becomes tachypneic with low
   tidal volumes.  In addition to this, he may have had some diaphragmatic
   weakness. Based on previous echo he does not have pulmonary
   hypertension and only has a trace of heart failure on clinical exam
   without much improvement of breathing after diuresis.  Last NIF while
   intubated was
 26 cm H2O. We have decided not to repeat this. An
   inspiratory/expiratory CXR was ordered but the patient did not perform
   the needed respiratory maneuvers. We decided not to repeat because his
   other chest x-rays have been quite nice inspiratory films, suggesting
   that if the diaphragm is weak, we may not see it this way. PNA was
   quite possible based on thick secretions, cough, but CXRs are now clear
   and sputum examination has not been fruitful.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia
   Breathing is improved. Although still requiring supplemental O2 he is
   now extubated. Likely smoking-related lung injury and known OSA,
   possible PNA contributing, now completed ceftriaxone and levo. No
   meaningful improvement with lasix so far, but continuing given likely
   volume increase during admission
 last dose today. Neurology have
   suggested that a weakened diaphragm from Parsonage-[**Doctor Last Name **] brachial
   plexopathy as a possible contributor, having ruled out myasthenia
   [**Last Name (un) **], ALS, Guillian-[**Location (un) **] and thinking other causes unlikely.
   - Permissive CO2 around 58-62 mmHg
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Last dose Lasix 10 m.g IV with goal to be even to down slightly
   - Continue mask and trials of nasal cannula
   OSA
   Treated with autotitrating CPAP last night.  This should continue with
   education and continuance at home.
   - Continue pressure support with mask at night.
   Transaminitis
   Possible statin or Propofol, the former more likely. Statins held and
   now all trending down. Not a complete contraindication, therefore
   restarting lower dose (which can still be of benefit)
   - Statin 10 mg (80 mg started on admission)
   - Follow
   Fever
   Still slightly warm, but no positive cultures nor other obvious site of
   infection. Unlikely VAP.
   - Follow cultures but no more for now
   - CXR depending on exam findings
   Lethargy/altered mental status
   Appears to be resolving with improvement of respiratory status and
   weaning of sedation. [**Month (only) 51**] have been purely secondary to respiratory
   failure. Good to keep in mind unlikely contribution of brainstem
   Binswanger disease but presentation somewhat indolent.
   - Follow and evaluate further when respiratory status improved.
   Rash
   Resolved. Unclear if drug reaction (is similar to drug rash) or,
   perhaps less likely, viral exanthem.
   Elevated troponin/ECG changes
   NSTEMI stable on ASA, BB (adjust as tolerated), statin. Cardiology
   following.  Consider ACEI on discharge.
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID (has been held without clear reason
   pressures have been high enough to not invoke hold). Now got BB
   yesterday and this a.m.
   - Statin (now 10mg) and ASA (reduce from 325 to 81 mg)
   - Consider ACEI/Ca channel antagonist if needed subsequently
   - Follow-up with cardiology as outpatient
   Polycythemia
   Stable
 likely related to COPD/OSA. Will follow.
   Constipation
   Resolved and in fact stool was loose.
   - Continue colace/senna

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a significant smoking history. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, reduced level of consciousness, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient also has diffuse brain disease on MRI, including subcortical white matter and pons involvement, suggesting possible Parsonage-Brachial Plexopathy with diaphragmatic involvement. He was initially intubated but has been successfully extubated and is now on a face mask with supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient has been experiencing breathing difficulties and requires supplemental oxygen. It is important to monitor his respiratory status closely, as there may be ongoing issues related to his weakened diaphragm and underlying lung injury due to smoking.

2. NSTEMI: The patient has had an acute coronary event, specifically NSTEMI. He is currently stable, but ongoing cardiac care is necessary, including monitoring of his blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac enzymes. Medications such as aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and potentially ACE inhibitors should be continued or adjusted as needed.

3. Polycythemia: The patient has stable polycythemia, likely related to COPD/OSA. This condition needs to be managed to prevent complications such as thrombosis or stroke.
