","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical aortic stenosis (AS) and a valve area of less than 0.8 cm. She is scheduled for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) on Tuesday. The patient also has an incidental asymptomatic high-grade AV block and a relatively fast but unreliable junctional escape rhythm. There are no signs of congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2Â°C, blood pressure ranging from 127/40 mmHg to 135/48 mmHg, heart rate between 46-57 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR) Surgery: The patient is scheduled for an AVR due to her critical AS. This surgery carries potential risks such as bleeding, infection, blood clots, irregular heart rhythm, and reaction to anesthesia.

2. High-Grade AV Block: The patient has an asymptomatic high-grade AV block with a relatively fast but unreliable junctional escape rhythm. If the blockage worsens, it may lead to complete heart block, which can cause symptoms like dizziness, fainting, and even cardiac arrest.

3. Junctional Escape Rhythm: The patient's unreliable junctional escape rhythm may not effectively maintain adequate heart rate and blood pressure if the AV block"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical aortic stenosis (valve area < 0.8) who will undergo aortic valve replacement (AVR) on Tuesday. The patient also has an incidental asymptomatic high-grade AV block, likely an infra-his block. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100-135/33-48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include a second-degree AV block Mobitz II, loud harsh systolic murmur without S2, mild kyphosis, crackles 2/3 up lungs bilaterally, soft abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness, and no femoral bruits. The patient's lab results show normal hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels.

Plan:
1. Rhythm: Monitor for high-grade AV block. If present, give metoprolol and consider temporary pacemaker wire. Keep pacer pads on and monitor in the critical care unit (CCU).
2. Pump: Continue gentle diuresis and wean O2 as tolerated. Plan for AVR on Tuesday and continue crackles management.
3. Coronaries: No evidence of coronary artery disease. Continue ASA and consider discontinuing simv"

   # RHYTHM: High grade AV block w/ relatively fast but unreliable
   junctional escape rhythm. Pt. asymptomatic. Conducts better with slower
   rate so if having increased block would give metoprolol instead of
   atropine.
   - give metoprolol if >3 consecutive p waves w/o a QRS, then call EP for
   temp wire
   - Keep pacer pads on
   - Monitor in CCU

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical aortic stenosis (AS) and an aortic valve area of less than 0.8 cm. She is planned for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) on Tuesday. The patient also has an incidental asymptomatic high-grade AV block, likely an infra-hisian block. The patient is currently stable, with vital signs within normal limits. She is receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula and is expected to tolerate weaning off it. The patient has crackles 2/3 up lungs bilaterally but is asymptomatic. She has no history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is not currently on any coronary medications. The patient has a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) for which she is taking aspirin. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's critical AS and planned AVR, there is a risk of cardiac complications during and after the surgery, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or low cardiac output.
2. Respiratory complications: The presence of crackles 2/3 up lungs bilaterally indicates possible fluid accumulation in the lungs, which could lead to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Thromboembolic complications: As the patient is on prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin for DVT prevention, there is a risk of bleeding or thrombosis.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections, especially in the ICU setting, which can include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
5. Neurological complications: Considering the patient's history of TIA, there is a possibility of neurological events during her hospital stay.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical aortic stenosis (AS) who is planned for aortic valve replacement (AVR) on Tuesday. She has an incidental asymptomatic atrioventricular (AV) block. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/40 to 135/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal range. She is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has crackles 2/3 up in the lungs bilaterally. Physical examination reveals a loud harsh systolic murmur without audible S2, supple neck with no visible jugular venous pulse (JVP), and mild kyphosis. No femoral bruits or abdominal aortic enlargement is noted. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: Critical aortic stenosis can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, syncope, and heart failure. Surgical intervention through AVR is necessary to relieve the obstruction and improve the patient's condition.
2. AV Block: The presence of a high-grade AV block increases the risk of complete heart block, which can result in bradycardia and potentially lead to hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring and appropriate management with medication or temporary pacing may be required.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of crackles 2/"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with critical aortic stenosis (AS) and an aortic valve area of less than 0.8. She has been diagnosed with atrioventricular (AV) block, specifically an infra-hisian AV block. The patient is currently asymptomatic and her vital signs are stable.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient will undergo an aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedure on Tuesday. Temporary pacing has been recommended due to the high-grade AV block, and the use of metoprolol instead of atropine has been suggested if there are increased blocks. The patient's pacer pads should remain on, and she should be monitored in the critical care unit (CCU).

In terms of management, the patient's critical AS with a valve area of 0.5 cm and estimated flow of [**Age over 90**] m/s requires surgical planning for AVR. Crackles in the lungs have been noted, but the patient remains asymptomatic. Oxygen therapy can be weaned as tolerated, and gentle diuresis has been initiated to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500 cc. Carotid ultrasound and dental consultation have been scheduled for Monday, and anesthesia consultation will also take place on the same day.

There are no evident coronary artery disease (CAD) risks, but the patient has a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), for which she is already taking simv"

The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical aortic stenosis (valve area < 0.8) who is planned for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) on Tuesday. She also has an incidental asymptomatic high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, likely infra-hisian block. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1Â°F, blood pressure of 122/57 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals a loud harsh systolic murmur without S2, mild kyphosis, crackles 2/3 up lungs bilaterally, soft abdomen, no extremity edema or femoral bruits, and no skin changes. Laboratory results show normal hemoglobin and leukocyte levels, elevated creatinine (1.2 mg/dL), slightly low potassium (3.8 mEq/L), and within normal limits for other parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's critical aortic stenosis can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and potentially result in heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. They have a history of allergies to Naprosyn and previous antibiotic use. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of angina and dyspnea. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/50 to 140/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Fluid balance shows an input of 300 mL and output of 1,200 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 900 mL. The patient is not on respiratory support, but an arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.27. The physical examination shows no additional abnormalities. Laboratory results include white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 41.4%, platelet count of 228 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose of 109 mg/dL, and PT/PTT/INR within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical aortic stenosis (AS), with a valve area less than 0.8 cm2, planned for aortic valve replacement (AVR) on Tuesday. She has an incidental asymptomatic high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, likely an infra-hisian block. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1Â°F, blood pressure of 122/57 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen. She has crackles 2/3 up in the lungs bilaterally but remains asymptomatic.

The patient's physical examination shows a loud harsh systolic murmur without a second heart sound (S2), indicating the presence of AS. She also has mild kyphosis, no peripheral edema, and no jugular venous distention (JVD). Her abdomen is soft with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly (HSM), and her extremities have no clubbing or peripheral pulses abnormalities. There are no skin abnormalities or stasis dermatitis.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, and glucose levels are within normal limits. However, her prothrom"

 ATRIOVENTRICULAR (AV) BLOCK
 AORTIC STENOSIS
   83 yo F w/ critical AS (valve area < 0.8) plan AVR Tuesday w/
   incidental high grade AV block, likely infra-his block.
   .
   # RHYTHM: High grade AV block w/ relatively fast but unreliable
   junctional escape rhythm. Pt. asymptomatic. Conducts better with slower
   rate so if having increased block would give metoprolol instead of
   atropine.
   - no arrhythmias/blocks overnight
   - give metoprolol if >3 consecutive p waves w/o a QRS
   - temporary pacer today, for AVR tomorrow
