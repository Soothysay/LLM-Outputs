   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic
   breast CA and hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized
   weakness and is found to be in severe acute renal failure. Now HD#2.
   Plan:
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. Most likely
   pre-renal, with contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly
   depleted on exam. Fe Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of
   14, consistent with pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
   Appreciate renal recs.
   - 2 amps bicarb now
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - will bolus aggressively with fluid overnight, received 1L NS on
   arrival, will now use D5 with sodium bicarb
   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies
   - cont to trend lactate
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness. Bowel and bladder
   incontinence are concerning for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**]
   globally depressed mental status. No acute cause identified on head CT.
   Could be delirium secondary to an underlying infectious process (see
   below for infectious work-up).
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium
   - will obtain MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to rule out cord compression
   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist)
   # Leukocytosis: WBC increased after receiving decadron with the taxol
   and is likely steroid induced. Now trending down. In the setting of new
   acute renal failure and lactic acidosis, cannot rule out infection,
   however there is currently no localizing signs or symptoms. She is
   afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Does have a productive cough, but
   this is a very chronic issue for her with no new change on CXR. Growing
   GPCs in blood from [**12-3**]. [**Month (only) 51**] be contaminant, but some concern for
   sepsis given confuion an renal failure.
   - resend blood cx
   - vancomycin 1 g I v x1
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 2
   days ago.
   - will touch base with oncology in the AM regarding treatment plan,
   however will likely defer further treatment pending resolution of ARF
   - cont tussionex for cough
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   - will hold anti-hypertensives overnight
   # FEN: aggressive IVF as above, replete lytes prn, regular diet as
   tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presented with confusion and generalized weakness and was found to be in severe acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed significant renal failure over a ten-day period with an anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. This indicates pre-renal failure due to intravascular depletion. The patient's urine sodium levels are low, suggesting pre-renal causes. Treatment includes aggressive fluid resuscitation, electrolyte management, and avoidance of nephrotoxins.

2. Weakness/Confusion: The patient's weakness and confusion are likely secondary to acute renal failure. The right lower extremity weakness could also be due to a potential cord lesion, which needs further investigation. The head CT did not reveal any acute causes, but delirium secondary to an underlying infectious process should be considered. Serial neuro exams should be continued, and an MRI of the spine should be obtained to rule out cord compression. An MRI brain with contrast should also be done when renal function improves to look for evidence of new metastases.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's increased white blood cell count is likely steroid-induced after receiving dexamethasone and taxol. In the setting of new acute renal failure and lactic acid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presents with confusion, generalized weakness, and severe acute renal failure. The patient has been treated with various medications, including Taxol and Xeloda, which are unlikely to cause renal failure. The likely cause of renal failure is pre-renal, possibly due to NSAID use and intravascular depletion. The patient has received fluid resuscitation with normal saline and dextrose with sodium bicarbonate. Further plans include continuing renal recommendations, repleting calcium, using a phosphate binder, encouraging oral fluid intake, avoiding nephrotoxins, and monitoring renal function closely. Other assessments and plans include leukocytosis/bacteremia, weakness/confusion, and metastatic breast cancer. The patient is currently stable and will continue to be monitored in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's severe acute renal failure needs close monitoring for any further deterioration in kidney function. Continued fluid resuscitation and avoidance of nephrotoxins are important in preventing or managing AKI.
2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and bacteremia raises concerns about a potential infection. Close monitoring of blood cultures and repeat cultures from the line are necessary to rule out or treat any ongoing infection.
3. Delirium: The patient's confusion and weakness may be secondary to acute renal failure or another underlying"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic
   breast CA and hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized
   weakness and is found to be in severe acute renal failure. Now HD#2.
   Plan:
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6.  Taxol and
   Xeloda unlikely to cause renal failure. Most likely pre-renal, with
   contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly depleted on exam. Fe
   Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of 14, consistent with
   pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound. Urine eos negative
   making AID unlikely, but still a possibility given lack of sensitivity
   of the test. Received 1.5 L NS in the ED, and 3L subsequently on the
   floor.
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - alternate boluses between 1 L NS and 1 L D5W with bicarbonate
   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies
   - recheck abg, lactate and use bicarb appropriately
   # Leukocytosis/bacteremia: . Growing GPCs in blood from [**12-3**]. [**Month (only) 51**] be
   contaminant, but some concern for sepsis given confusion and renal
   failure.  Does not quite meet sepsis criteria as leukocytosis
   resolving, and only has bacteremia which may be contaminant. WBC
   increased after receiving decadron with the taxol and is likely steroid
   induced. Now trending down. In the setting of new acute renal failure
   and lactic acidosis, cannot rule out infection, however there is
   currently no localizing signs or symptoms. She is afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable. Does have a productive cough, but this is a
   very chronic issue for her with no new change on CXR- resend blood cx.
   Patient may have been bacteremic after port was accessed on 1 d PTA,
   and could have showered bacteria into the blood stream.
   - vancomycin 1 g I v x1 to cover for possible line infection
   - f/u blood and urine cultures; ? coag neg. staph as contaminnat
   - repeat cxs from line now
   - daily surveillance cxs
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - consider port removal if bacteremia documented from port site
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness, which is less
   unilateral on exam today. Bowel and bladder incontinence are concerning
   for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**] globally depressed mental
   status. No acute cause identified on head CT. Could be delirium
   secondary to an underlying infectious process (see below for infectious
   work-up).
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium
   - MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to rule out cord compression
   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist)
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 3
   days ago.
   - will touch base with oncology in the AM regarding treatment plan,
   however will likely defer further treatment pending resolution of ARF
   - cont tussionex for cough
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   - Continue metoprolol and holding other outpatient antihypertensives at
   this time for concern of impending septic physiology
   # FEN: aggressive IVF as above, replete lytes prn, regular diet as
   tolerated
   # Access: R port-a-cath
   # PPx: heparin SQ, outpatient H2 blocker
   # Code: full code, confirmed with patient and HCP
   # Dispo: ICU for now
   # Comm: with patient and family

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4058**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  We have also discussed the
   patient
s case in depth with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1936**], renal attending.
   The clinical picture may have initially had a component of pre renal
   azotemia, but her BUN and Creat  were too high for that alone and with
   her having had rather mild volume contraction initially and with
   oliguria now persisting after 5+liters of fluid, we think she more
   likely has ATN, perhaps from NSAIDs or per chance even hepatorenal
   syndrome from her liver mets.  In favor of the latter is low urine
   sodium and her ascites and coagulopathy.  She is intravascularly fully
   repleted and we
ll turn down her IV
s and work up portal vein
   thrombosis, hoping for a turnaround in renal function.  Her lactic
   acidosis is of additional concern, raising possibility of systemic
   infection.  Her GPC on bld culture could implicate her portacath.
   Additional bld cultures via line and peripherally will be done as well
   as Vancomycin being continued.  For now she is hemodynamically stable
   with relatively comfortable respiratory status.
   Time spent in the care of this critically ill patient: 65 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 83**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension.
- Chief complaints are dizziness and acute renal failure.
- The patient was started on Vancomycin and received fluid resuscitation with normal saline and D5W with sodium bicarbonate.
- ABG results show a pH of 7.27, indicating severe metabolic acidosis.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for feeling better and denying cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, confusion, or weakness.
- Physical examination reveals mild right basilar rales, decreased breath sounds at the left base, no jugular venous distention, and no peripheral edema.
- Neurological examination shows normal mental status, oriented to person, place, and time, with intact cranial nerves and motor strength in all extremities.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes, as well as decreased albumin levels.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, leukocytosis/bacteremia, and weakness/confusion.
- Plan includes continuing aggressive IV fluid administration, electrolyte management, avoiding nephrotoxins, monitoring renal function, and rechecking ABG and lactate levels.
- The patient's port-a-cath has been accessed, and there is concern for possible line infection, which has been covered with Vancomycin.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic
   breast CA and hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized
   weakness and is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. Most likely
   pre-renal, with contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly
   depleted on exam. Fe Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of
   14, consistent with pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
   Appreciate renal recs.
   - 2 amps bicarb now
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - will bolus aggressively with fluid overnight, received 1L NS on
   arrival, will now use D5 with sodium bicarb
   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies
   - cont to trend lactate
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness. Bowel and bladder
   incontinence are concerning for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**]
   globally depressed mental status. No acute cause identified on head CT.
   Could be delirium secondary to an underlying infectious process (see
   below for infectious work-up).
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium
   - will obtain MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to rule out cord compression
   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist)
   # Leukocytosis: WBC increased after receiving decadron with the taxol
   and is likely steroid induced. Now trending down. In the setting of new
   acute renal failure and lactic acidosis, cannot rule out infection,
   however there is currently no localizing signs or symptoms. She is
   afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Does have a productive cough, but
   this is a very chronic issue for her with no new change on CXR. Growing
   GPCs in blood from [**12-3**]. [**Month (only) 51**] be contaminant, but some concern for
   sepsis given confuion an renal failure.
   - resend blood cx
   - vancomycin 1 g I v x1
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 2
   days ago.
   - will touch base with oncology in the AM regarding treatment plan,
   however will likely defer further treatment pending resolution of ARF
   - cont tussionex for cough
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   - will hold anti-hypertensives overnight

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presents with confusion, generalized weakness, and severe acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing anion gap metabolic acidosis with a lactate level of 4.6. There is evidence of pre-renal azotemia based on the urine sodium concentration and fractional excretion of urea. The patient's renal function is improving with aggressive fluid resuscitation. She also has leukocytosis, which is likely steroid-induced due to recent chemotherapy. The patient has a history of a productive cough but no new changes on the chest X-ray. There are growing gram-positive cocci in her blood culture, and concern for sepsis is present. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and will have repeat blood and urine cultures. She has metastatic breast cancer and started a new regimen of Taxol two days ago. Further treatment for the cancer will be deferred pending resolution of acute renal failure. The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, and she is being aggressively hydrated with intravenous fluids. Her sodium bicarbonate levels are low, and electrolyte imbalances need to be corrected. The patient's mental status is improving, and a head CT showed no acute cause for her confusion. An MRI of the spine is planned to rule out cord compression."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presented with confusion and generalized weakness. She was found to have severe acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and avoidance of nephrotoxins. An MR spine was performed to rule out cord compression, and a repeat head CT showed no interval change from the previous MRI. The patient's leukocytosis is likely steroid-induced due to her recent chemotherapy treatment. There are no localizing signs or symptoms to suggest an infection, but cultures have been obtained and will be monitored. The patient's metastatic breast cancer treatment has been temporarily deferred pending resolution of acute renal failure. The patient's hypertension is currently well-controlled, and anti-hypertensive medications have been held overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed significant renal failure over a ten-day period, with an anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. This could be pre-renal in origin, possibly due to NSAID use. It is important to continue monitoring renal function and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly.
2. Infection: Although there are currently no localizing signs or symptoms of infection, the patient's leukocytosis should be closely monitored, especially considering her recent chemotherapy treatment. Blood and urine cultures have been obtained, and any changes"

   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: ? Most likely secondary to acute renal failure.
   However am anisocoria this AM not previously noted; increased
   confusion, vomiting and +babinski on left.  Unlcear if these are acute
   changes.  Acute renal failure as well as hepatic encephalopathy could
   be causes of acute changes.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be steroid related?  (long half
   life).  No acute cause identified on head CT.  Possible Previously
   scheduled for Head MR today as outpatient; with acute renal changes,
   would be reluctant to give contrast.
   - discuss with radiology  MRI this AM
   - continue serial neuro exams

   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness. Bowel and bladder

   globally depressed mental status. No acute cause identified on head CT.
   Could be delirium secondary to an underlying infectious process (see

   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium

   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. Most likely
   pre-renal, with contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly
   depleted on exam. Fe Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of
   14, consistent with pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
   Appreciate renal recs.
   - 2 amps bicarb now
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - will bolus aggressively with fluid overnight, received 1L NS on

   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presented with confusion and generalized weakness, and was found to have severe acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing anisocoria with a right pupil that is smaller than the left. Her physical examination reveals cachexia, no acute distress, and 2+ lower extremity edema bilaterally, with the left side being more prominent. The patient's neurological examination shows alertness, orientation to person, place, and time, but with slow speech and mild slurring. She has upgoing left toe, no clonus, and 4/4 strength throughout, although the exam is unreliable. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for feeling slow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed significant renal failure over a ten-day period with an elevated anion gap and lactate levels. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy such as dialysis.
2. Metastatic breast cancer: The patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer, which may contribute to her overall weakness and confusion. Cancer-related symptoms can include fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, and cognitive dysfunction.
3. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, her history of hypertension increases"

 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST
 H/O ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness. Bowel and bladder
   incontinence are concerning for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**]
   globally depressed mental status. No acute cause identified on head CT.
   Could be delirium secondary to an underlying infectious process (see
   below for infectious work-up).
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium
   - will obtain MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to rule out cord compression
   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. Most likely
   pre-renal, with contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly
   depleted on exam. Fe Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of
   14, consistent with pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
   Appreciate renal recs.
   - 2 amps bicarb now
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - will bolus aggressively with fluid overnight, received 1L NS on
   arrival, will now use D5 with sodium bicarb
   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC increased after receiving decadron with the taxol
   and is likely steroid induced. Now trending down. In the setting of new
   acute renal failure and lactic acidosis, cannot rule out infection,
   however there is currently no localizing signs or symptoms. She is
   afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Does have a productive cough, but
   this is a very chronic issue for her with no new change on CXR.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - monitor fever curve and culture if spikes
   .
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 2
   days ago.
   - will touch base with oncology in the AM regarding treatment plan,
   however will likely defer further treatment pending resolution of ARF
   - cont tussionex for cough
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   - will hold anti-hypertensives overnight
   .
   # FEN: aggressive IVF as above, replete lytes prn, regular diet as
   tolerated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presents with confusion and generalized weakness and is found to be in severe acute renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:
1. Delirium secondary to an underlying infectious process.
2. Renal failure, which is likely pre-renal in nature due to intravascular depletion, NSAID use, and lack of hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
3. Leukocytosis that may be steroid-induced due to recent chemotherapy treatment.
4. Metastatic breast cancer with possible new lesions in the brain or spinal cord.
5. Hypotension that requires monitoring and management.
6. Potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding or stress ulcer due to the use of anticoagulation therapy (heparin).
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
9. Metabolic acidosis with anion gap.
10. Electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyphophosphatemia.

These are the potential complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of acute renal failure, breast cancer, and altered mental status. They have been receiving treatment in the ICU. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with a decrease in urine output and the presence of guaiac-positive emesis. Blood cultures have revealed bacteremia with gram-positive cocci, and the patient is currently on vancomycin. The patient's mental status has worsened, with a suspected diagnosis of uremic encephalopathy. The cause of renal failure remains unclear, but there are concerns about possible ATN post a pre-renal state. Electrolytes and acid-base levels are acceptable, but the patient's condition requires further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uremic encephalopathy: The patient's worsening mental status and elevated BUN levels suggest the possibility of uremic encephalopathy, which can occur in cases of acute renal failure.
2. ATN (Acute Tubular Necrosis): The BUN/Creatinine ratio suggests the possibility of ATN following a pre-renal state. ATN is a common cause of acute kidney injury and can lead to further deterioration in renal function.
3. Line infection: The presence of bacteremia with gram-positive cocci raises concerns about a possible line infection, especially considering the patient's multiple lines.
4. Metastatic disease: The patient's underlying breast cancer may have resulted in metastatic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presented with confusion and generalized weakness and was found to be in severe acute renal failure. The patient has undergone several interventions including dialysis, line placement, and initiation of lactulose. Her leukocytosis has improved with Vancomycin, and she is currently afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The patient's acute renal failure is presumed to be pre-renal, and her metastatic breast cancer is being treated with a new Taxol regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of metastatic disease and confusion, hepatic encephalopathy could be a contributing factor. Lactulose has been initiated to address this possibility.
2. Steroid-related complications: The patient's long half-life steroid may contribute to her confusion and weakness. Monitoring and adjustment of steroid levels may be necessary.
3. Infection: Despite improvement with Vancomycin, the patient remains at risk for further infections due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines. Close monitoring of blood and urine cultures is essential.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure requires ongoing management, including renal diet, medication adjustment, and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
5. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic breast cancer needs close monitoring, and the effectiveness of the Tax"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presents with confusion, generalized weakness, and severe acute renal failure. The patient also has leukocytosis and a history of acidosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's severe acute renal failure may lead to further deterioration of kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload. This can result in symptoms such as decreased urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's history of acidosis indicates a potential complication related to the metabolism of substances in the body. This condition can be caused by various factors, including poor kidney function, respiratory problems, or the accumulation of lactic acid.

3. Infection: Leukocytosis, an increase in white blood cell count, suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection in the body. It is important to monitor the patient's blood cultures and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

4. Neurological changes: The patient's confusion, vomiting, anisocoria (unequal pupil size), and positive Babinski sign may indicate neurological issues. These symptoms could be related to hepatic encephalopathy, steroid use, or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and neurologic examination is necessary.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the note mentions several significant events and findings:

1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): The patient underwent an MRI on [**2107-12-5**] at 10:27 AM. The reason for the MRI was due to increased size in the right upper extremity. However, the official read of the MRI results is pending.

2. Dialysis Catheter: The patient had a dialysis catheter started on [**2107-12-5**] at 5:55 PM. This may be related to the patient's renal function, which is further supported by the presence of renal failure mentioned in the assessment section.

3. Vomiting: The patient vomited once in the morning, with occult blood positive. This indicates the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) was mildly decreased.

4. Mental Status: The patient's mental status deteriorated to one-word answers during the morning examination. Additionally, the patient exhibited an increasingly glossy visage and anisocoria (unequal pupil sizes) for the first time.

5. Head MRI: The patient underwent a head MRI, which showed diffuse metastatic disease. The official read of this MRI is still pending.

6. Lactate Trend: The patient's lactate levels are continuing to trend down but are still elevated.

7. Hemodynamic Monitoring: The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has fluctuated throughout the day, ranging from being attentive and oriented to being confused and lethargic. This could be due to various factors such as encephalopathy, electrolyte imbalances, or seizures.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level (7.0 mg/dL) and a decrease in urine output (283 mL over 24 hours). These findings indicate impaired kidney function, which may require further evaluation and management.

3. Metastatic breast cancer: The patient has multiple small metastases throughout the brain as shown on MRI. This indicates that the primary cancer is likely breast cancer, which has spread to the brain. Treatment options should be considered to address the cancer burden.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 9.9 K/uL, suggesting an infection or inflammation in the body.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 7.9 g/dL, indicating a decreased number of red blood cells. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the anemia.

   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: Improving.  Likely multifactorial given MRI
   findings and Acute renal failure.   EEG ordered yesterday for concern
   for seizure; planned for this AM.  Also concerned for liver
   involvement, but pt improved without getting lactulose.
   - EEG today
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - continue dialysis for uremia.
   - continue steroids; Tx2 of radiation today.
   .
    # Leukocytosis: WBC down to 0.9 this am; pt is d+6 from taxol and this
   is likely a result of treatment. Currently on Vanco for +blood cultures
   (x1); all other blood cultures are negative.
   - continue Vanco dosed by level for now.  Likely 4 week treatment
   needed.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC, watch for neutropenia, follow Onc results re
   Neupogen?
   - monitor fever curve and culture if spikes
   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be pre-renal.  UPO improving. Renal
   following;
   - f/u  vanc level for GBS,
   - continue phos binder
   - bicarb as needed
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   # Metastatic breast CA: New Taxol regimen initiated last month
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   -          will hold anti-hypertensives

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presents with confusion and generalized weakness, and is found to be in severe acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/58 mmHg to 151/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with slow and non-slurred speech. Neurological examination reveals anisocoria with a right pupil larger than the left, both sluggishly reactive to light. Physical examination also shows jaundice, cachexia, and edema in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes (AST and ALT). The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range, while potassium is slightly elevated. The differential leukocyte count shows an increased number of neutrophils and lymphocytes.

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin for positive blood cultures, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. She has undergone two"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of renal failure, breast cancer, and is currently receiving chemotherapy. She has multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease. The patient has been receiving XRT and has had 12 treatments so far. She is on dialysis, receiving antibiotics, and other medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she has leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and a history of metabolic acidosis. The patient is on full code status and has an indwelling port, dialysis catheter, and central venous line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Metastatic Disease: The presence of multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses indicates the possibility of worsening metastatic breast cancer. This could lead to further neurological complications and deterioration in the patient's mental status.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. This can result in the accumulation of waste products and toxins in the body, leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. In patients with compromised immune systems, such as those undergoing chemotherapy, infections can quickly become severe and life-threatening.
4. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PT/INR suggests a bleeding tendency. This increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the patient's central lines"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension. She presents with confusion and generalized weakness and is found to be in severe acute renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given include:

1. Worsening of metastatic disease: The MRI findings suggest the development of multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses, which are highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease. This could potentially lead to neurological complications and impact the patient's overall prognosis.

2. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and the planned EEG for concern for seizure indicate a possibility of seizures. If seizures occur, they may require further management and antiepileptic treatment.

3. Liver involvement: Although the patient showed improvement without getting lactulose, there is concern for liver involvement. This could potentially lead to hepatic encephalopathy or other liver-related complications.

4. Acute kidney injury: The patient is in severe acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. If not properly managed, this could progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

5. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is on vancomycin for positive blood cultures. Close monitoring of blood and urine cultures is necessary to prevent or manage any potential infections.

6. Chemotherapy-related complications: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy with taxol, which can cause side effects such as"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status. She has a history of renal failure and is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient has received 12 treatments of XRT and is showing multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.2°C, current temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 138/58 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (102 K/uL), creatinine level (6.4 mg/dL), blood glucose (177 mg/dL), and lactic acid level (4.4 mmol/L). The patient also has leukocytosis, acute renal failure, breast cancer, and a history of acidosis. 

The patient has multiple lines, including an indwelling port, a 20-gauge line, and a dialysis catheter. She is on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and vancomycin for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, further deterioration of mental status, development of new metastatic lesions, and potential infections due to prolonged hospitalization and use of indwelling lines."
