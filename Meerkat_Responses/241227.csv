   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation, s/p allo
   SCT in [**2-24**], now with AMS and hypothermia in the setting of  BK
   viremia.
   .
   # Worsening AMS/Hypothermia: Most likey infectious, possibly of a new
   source. Concern for fungemia in his setting with so many risk factors
   and an elevated beta glucan. Also, a worsening BK viremia could be a
   possibility.  CSF studies all negative including BK/[**Male First Name (un) 561**] and adenovirus.
   Patient received two doses of cidofovir so far, first on [**8-25**] and
   [**9-1**], (was pretreated in ICU with probenecid and IVF).  EEG negative
   for seizures.  Other possible cause could be hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Appreciate ID and neuro input
   - Appreciate endocrine recs
   - Fungal studies sent and pending
   - Continue NG tube for oral meds in setting of AMS
   - Restraints for now in setting of agitation
   - Continue broad coverage with dapto, meropenem and ambisome
   - random cortisol is 8.6, will perform [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim, will switch
   methylprednisone to dexamethasone (double the equivalent dose);
   unlikely to be an meaningful test, but will follow up
   - TSH/fT4 ? central hypothyrodism vs sick euthyroid, appreciate
   endocrinology recs
   - follow up BK virus load
   - follow up BCX including mycolytic cultures
   - continue haldol prn, D/C zyprexa for now as it will more diagnostic
   to use one at a time and see its effect and avoid benzos
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis when patient is less agitated
   .
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - Continue cidofovir
   .
   # Episodes of hypoglycemia: TPN with insulin is discontinued.  Likely
   secondary to ongoing infections.
   - appreciate endocrine recs
   .
   # Diarrhea: Most likely from GVHD.  Now resolved.  Bilious looking out
   put from NGT.
   - Check I's and O's
   - Replete lytes
   - follow up official result of KUB
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Most likely due to
   immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. Will transfuse for Hct <21.
   -One unit PRBCs given today
   -Guiaic stools
   -Active type and screen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has a history of CLL and underwent an allo-SCT. They are now presenting with AMS (Altered Mental Status) and hypothermia, which could be due to an infectious cause, possibly a new source. There is also concern for fungemia and a worsening BK viremia.

2. The patient received two doses of cidofovir for BK viremia and has been pretreated with probenecid and IVF. EEG results are negative for seizures, and other possible causes for AMS include hepatic encephalopathy.

3. The patient's random cortisol level is 8.6, and they will undergo a [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim. Methylprednisolone will be switched to dexamethasone. It is unlikely to be an meaningful test, but follow-up is planned.

4. There is a concern for central hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Endocrinology recommendations are appreciated.

5. The patient has episodes of hypoglycemia, likely secondary to ongoing infections. TPN with insulin has been discontinued.

6. The patient experienced diarrhea, which is now resolved, and is most likely due to GVHD. Bilious output from the NGT should be checked.

7. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, most likely"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation, s/p allo SCT (allogeneic stem cell transplantation), now with AMS (altered mental status) and hypothermia in the setting of BK viremia (BK virus infection).
- The patient has worsening AMS/Hypothermia, most likely infectious in nature, possibly from a new source. Concern for fungemia in his setting with multiple risk factors and an elevated beta glucan level. Worsening BK viremia could also be a possibility.
- The patient received two doses of cidofovir for BK viremia, but with negative CSF studies for BK and adenovirus. EEG negative for seizures.
- Other possible causes for AMS include hepatic encephalopathy.
- The patient has new bilateral apical infiltrates on CXR (chest X-ray), concerning for PNA (pneumonia). Daptomycin would have poor lung penetration, but the patient is also on meropenem.
- ID recs (infectious disease recommendations) are to hold on further BK tx (treatment) and add linezolid IV 600mg q12h.
- The patient has CLL with BMT (bone marrow transplant), c/b GVHD (graft-versus-host disease).

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of malignancy, altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and previous cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, hypothermia, hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. 

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The CT chest reveals bilateral apical pneumonia, which suggests an increased risk of developing pneumonia due to the patient's intubation and immobility.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and malignancy are risk factors for DVT and PE. The patient's arterial line and PICC line further increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to various factors such as hypoxia, sepsis, medication side effects, or electrolyte imbalances.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating a potential for persistent hypotension, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.

5. Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is below normal, indicating hypothermia. This can be caused by exposure, decreased metabolism, or inadequate warming measures.

6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to malignancy and altered nutrition"

   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of PEA arrest.  Radigraphic
   evidence for new RUL and LUL (post) infiltrate, suspect aspiration.
   Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Extubation attempt may be
   limited by altered mental status.
   PEA ARREST -- unclear precipitant.  Concerns include aspiration with
   hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  Doubt pulmonary embolism.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Improved.  Wean vasopressors.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- unclear etiology.  Attributed to medications,
   viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of
   SDH.   Limit psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH
   drainage viable option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).
   Monitor.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.

   Discussion with wife.  Updated medical conditiona and answered all
   questions.  Based on events over past 24 hours, wife states that if
   central line placement is medically indicated, she would approve
   placement, and clearly states that in the event of cardiac
   decompensation, CPR would be appropriate (as patient responded to CPR
   last PM).  At this time, will sign new ICU consent form, and will

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL who underwent an allo-SCT and is now admitted to the ICU following a PEA arrest. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient has altered mental status, hypotension, A-fib, and multiple other medical complications. He has anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by new right upper lobe (RUL) and left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrates on the radiograph. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, and extubation attempts may be limited by the patient's altered mental status.
2. PEA Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, the precipitant of which is unclear. Concerns include aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, and hypovolemia. Although pulmonary embolism is suspected, it is doubtful. The patient's condition has improved, and weaning of vasopressors is planned.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to infection and pharmacological agents. It has improved, and there are plans to wean vasopressors.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, with unclear etiology. It is attributed to medications, v"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL (large cell lymphoma) who underwent an allo-SCT (allogeneic stem cell transplant) and is now in the ICU following a PEA (pulmonary embolism) arrest. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, suspected aspiration, and altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls should be implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylaxis should be considered, such as the use of compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation if appropriate.
3. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension attributed to infection and pharmacological agents. Close monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure are essential.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced episodic hypoglycemia possibly related to insulin in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and ongoing infections. Glycemic control should be maintained carefully.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia likely due to immunos"

   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of PEA arrest.  Radigraphic
   evidence for new RUL and LUL (post) infiltrate, suspect aspiration.
   Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Extubation attempt may be
   limited by altered mental status.
   PEA ARREST -- unclear precipitant.  Concerns include aspiration with
   hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  Doubt pulmonary embolism.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Improved.  Wean vasopressors.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- unclear etiology.  Attributed to medications,
   viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of
   SDH.   Limit psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH
   drainage viable option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).
   Monitor.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for Hct <21.
   HTN -- hold antiHTN meds while on vasopressor.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL (large cell transformation) who underwent an allo SCT (allogeneic stem cell transplantation) and is now admitted to the MICU following a PEA (pulmonary embolism arrest). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. There is also evidence of new right upper lobe (RUL) and left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrates on radiographs. The patient's mental status is altered, making extubation attempts challenging.

The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which is unclear in precipitant. It could be related to aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, or hypovolemia. The patient's blood pressure is also hypotensive, attributed to infection and pharmacological agents. The patient was in atrial fibrillation but has since converted to normal sinus rhythm.

The patient has several medical conditions, including CLL that underwent bone marrow transplantation with complications of GVHD (graft-versus-host disease). The patient is on immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens, including cidofovir.

The patient has experienced episodes of hypoglycemia, possibly due to insulin in TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and ongoing infections. Fluid repletion is needed, and the patient is anemic and thrombocytopenic, likely due to immunosuppression/in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma post-allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo SCT). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [9-10]. The patient's current condition includes worsening altered mental status (AMS) and hypothermia, bilateral apical infiltrates on chest X-ray, and concern for pneumonia (PNA). He also has a history of BK viremia and previous treatment with cidofovir. The patient's laboratory results show elevated beta glucan, low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem) and antifungal medication (ambisome). The patient's goals of care have been discussed with his wife, and he is now on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening AMS/Hypothermia: The patient's mental status is worsening, which could be due to an infectious cause or a new source of infection. There is also concern for fungemia, especially with elevated beta glucan levels. BK viremia is another possibility.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has new bilateral apical infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating a potential lung infection. This could be aspiration pneumonia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The arterial line stopped on 9/11 at 7:00 PM. The patient's wife signed a new ICU consent allowing for central venous line placement, and the code status was switched to FULL CODE. The patient's pain score is 5/5. No growth has been observed on any cultures thus far. Midazolam and fentanyl were discontinued. TPN nutrition was discussed, and the patient is currently receiving it through a PICC line. The patient's weight is 135 kg, and they have received a total of 3,136 mL of IV fluids. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%. The results of the arterial blood gas (ABG) show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 47 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 238 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 26 mEq/L. The patient's temperature is 35.6°C, heart rate is 102 beats per minute, and blood pressure is 97/58 mmHg. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, no signs of conjunctival pallor or scleral edema, normal heart sounds, and clear breath sounds bilaterally. The patient has edema in both lower extremities. The results of the laboratory tests indicate leukopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and impaired kidney function. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium. The patient's glucose level is significantly elevated. The patient's neurologic examination is unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing daily oral care, and assessing respiratory system baseline instability index (RSBI).

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheterization increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures like compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation should be considered.

3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and appropriate mattress support should be implemented.

4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive lines increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including bloodstream infections and catheter-related infections. Cultures and surveillance"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal > 21, plt goal > 20. Linezolid was initiated yesterday and
   although thrombocytopenia is an adverse effect, this would not be
   expected to take place sooner than 1-2wks.
   - check DIC labs: fibrinogen, CBC, PT, INR, PTT, FDP, Haptoglobin
   - xfuse 1u PRBC today as HCT < 21 and check post-xfusion HCT
   - xfuse 3u platelets as plt 10 and pt bleeding from mouth, scrotum,
   urine
   - check post xfusion plt count
   - will need CVL placement after plt stabilization
   - hold off on NGT for PO meds as pt bleeding
   -Guiaic stools
   -Active type and screen
   # Worsening AMS/Hypothermia: Could be infectious, possibly of a new
   source- given aspiration pneumonia and high grade BK viremia . Concern
   for fungemia in his setting with so many risk factors and an elevated
   beta glucan. CSF studies all negative including BK/[**Male First Name (un) 561**] and adenovirus.
   Patient received two doses of cidofovir so far, first on [**8-25**] and
   [**9-1**], (was pretreated in ICU with probenecid and IVF).  EEG negative
   for seizures.  Hepatic encephalopathy less likely given EEG pattern and
   waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status not correlating with LFTs prior to
   arrival.
   - Restraints for now in setting of agitation
   - Continue broad coverage with meropenem and ambisome- change ambisome
   to 400mg IV q24h
   - continue linezolid 600mg IV q24h for pna
   - follow up BK virus load and Bcx
   - continue haldol prn, D/C zyprexa for now as it will more diagnostic
   to use one at a time and see its effect and avoid benzos
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis when patient is less agitated
   - goals of care discussed w/ wife- > now FULL CODE (if pt acutely
   worsens would recommend re-discussing goals)
   .- neo has been weaned off
   - amio held as pt in sinus
   - continue neutropenic precautions
   # PNA- bilateral apical infiltrates could be [**12-20**] aspiration PNA
   (although RUL infiltrates are abormal for aspiration PNA could be
   possible in this patient due to positioning during code and  recumbent
   position). Daptomysin would have poor lung penetration but patient is
   also on meropenem.
   - continue linezolid IV 600mg q12h as per ID recs
   - monitor plts
   .
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**]
s recs
   - follow-up any pending heme/onc recs

   Disposition :ICU
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo SCT) two years ago. He presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
- Worsening altered mental status (AMS) and hypothermia: Could be infectious or possibly of a new source, given aspiration pneumonia and high-grade BK viremia. Concern for fungemia in his setting with so many risk factors and an elevated beta glucan. CSF studies all negative including BK and adenovirus.
- Bilateral apical infiltrates on chest X-ray, which could be aspiration pneumonia (although right upper lobe infiltrates are abnormal for aspiration pneumonia).
- Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count of 10, with bleeding from the mouth, scrotum, and urine.
- Hypotension: MAP holding in the low 60s.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem), antifungals (ambisome), and linezolid for pancytopenia. He also received two doses of cidofovir for BK"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of PEA arrest.  Radigraphic
   evidence for new RUL and LUL (post) infiltrate, suspect aspiration.
   Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Extubation attempt may be
   limited by altered mental status.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new since [**9-6**] and attributed to aspiration
   event.  Treat as aspiration pneumonia.
   PEA ARREST -- unclear precipitant.  Concerns include aspiration with
   hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  Doubt pulmonary embolism.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Improved.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- unclear etiology.  Attributed to medications,
   viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of
   SDH.   Limit psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH
   drainage viable option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).
   Monitor.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for Hct <21.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds while on vasopressor.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal > 21, plt goal > 20. Linezolid was initiated yesterday and
   although thrombocytopenia is an adverse effect, this would not be
   expected to take place sooner than 1-2wks.
   - check DIC labs: fibrinogen, CBC, PT, INR, PTT, FDP, Haptoglobin
   - xfuse 1u PRBC today as HCT < 21 and check post-xfusion HCT
   - xfuse 3u platelets as plt 10 and pt bleeding from mouth, scrotum,
   urine
   - check post xfusion plt count
   - will need CVL placement after plt stabilization
   - hold off on NGT for PO meds as pt bleeding
   -Guiaic stools
   -Active type and screen
   # Worsening AMS/Hypothermia: Could be infectious, possibly of a new
   source- given aspiration pneumonia and high grade BK viremia . Concern
   for fungemia in his setting with so many risk factors and an elevated
   beta glucan. CSF studies all negative including BK/[**Male First Name (un) 561**] and adenovirus.
   Patient received two doses of cidofovir so far, first on [**8-25**] and
   [**9-1**], (was pretreated in ICU with probenecid and IVF).  EEG negative
   for seizures.  Hepatic encephalopathy less likely given EEG pattern and
   waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status not correlating with LFTs prior to
   arrival.
   - Restraints for now in setting of agitation
   - Continue broad coverage with meropenem and ambisome- change ambisome
   to 400mg IV q24h
   - continue linezolid 600mg IV q24h for pna
   - follow up BK virus load and Bcx
   - continue haldol prn, D/C zyprexa for now as it will more diagnostic
   to use one at a time and see its effect and avoid benzos
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis when patient is less agitated
   - goals of care discussed w/ wife- > now FULL CODE (if pt acutely
   worsens would recommend re-discussing goals)
   .- neo has been weaned off
   - amio held as pt in sinus
   - continue neutropenic precautions
   # PNA- bilateral apical infiltrates could be [**12-20**] aspiration PNA
   (although RUL infiltrates are abormal for aspiration PNA could be
   possible in this patient due to positioning during code and  recumbent
   position). Daptomysin would have poor lung penetration but patient is
   also on meropenem.
   - continue linezolid IV 600mg q12h as per ID recs
   - monitor plts
   .
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and subsequent transformation into aggressive large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo SCT) two years ago and has been experiencing adverse events such as autologous marrow suppression (AMS) and hypothermia in the setting of BK virusemia. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on September 10th.

The patient's current condition includes pancytopenia, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and worsening altered mental status/hypothermia. Pancytopenia is likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. The goal hematocrit (HCT) is greater than 21, and the platelet count goal is greater than 20. Linezolid was initiated yesterday, although thrombocytopenia is an adverse effect, this would not be expected to occur sooner than 1-2 weeks.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The coagulation profile indicates an elevated prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). Other lab values reveal elevated liver enzymes, abnormal kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo SCT) 2-24 weeks ago. He presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to apical infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggestive of possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient also has pancytopenia, which is most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. Other notable findings include AMS/hypothermia, hepatic encephalopathy, and potential BK viremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening AMS/Hypothermia: The patient's altered mental status and hypothermia could be infectious in nature, possibly from a new source given the aspiration pneumonia and high-grade BK viremia. There is also concern for fungemia due to the patient's risk factors and elevated beta glucan levels.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count are likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. The goal is to achieve a hematocrit (HCT) greater than 21% and platelet count greater than 20,000/mm3.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of PEA arrest.  Radigraphic
   evidence for new RUL and LUL (post) infiltrate, suspect aspiration.
   Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Extubation attempt may be
   limited by altered mental status.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new since [**9-6**] and attributed to aspiration
   event.  Treat as aspiration pneumonia.
   PEA ARREST -- unclear precipitant.  Concerns include aspiration with
   hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  Doubt pulmonary embolism.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Improved.
   GI BLEED -- [**Last Name **] problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding, but at
   risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and on
   steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to fall,
   consider GI consultation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- unclear etiology.  Attributed to medications,
   viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of
   SDH.   Limit psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH
   drainage viable option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).
   Monitor.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <20.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds while on vasopressor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- hope to resume TPN --> may require new central
   line.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. There is evidence of new right upper lobe (RUL) and left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrates on the chest radiograph, which are suspected to be aspiration-related. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to medications, viremia, hepatic encephalopathy, or subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient has a history of GI bleeding, atrial fibrillation (A-FIB), anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension (HTN), and hypoglycemia. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently on multiple medications including prophylactic regimens.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if there is further deterioration in lung function or if the current ventilatory support is inadequate.
2. Pneumonia: The new infiltrates seen on the chest radiograph suggest aspiration pneumonia. If left untreated, this can lead to worsening respiratory failure and systemic infection.
3. Altered Mental Status: The underlying cause of the altered mental status"

   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Remains intubated, mechanically ventilated.  Tolerating SBT > 48 hrs,
   and remains on IPS= 5 cm H2O.
   Transient increased somnulance yesterday afternoon prompted repeat Head
   CT --> no increase in SDH.
   Somewhat more awake this AM, opens eyes, attempting to move arms,
   inconsistently to command.
   Less bleeding from oralpharynx and foley.
   Now with melena.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of PEA arrest.  Radigraphic
   evidence for new RUL and LUL (post) infiltrate, suspect aspiration.
   Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Extubation attempt may be
   limited by altered mental status.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new since [**9-6**] and attributed to aspiration
   event.  Treat as aspiration pneumonia.
   PEA ARREST -- unclear precipitant.  Concerns include aspiration with
   hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  Doubt pulmonary embolism.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Improved.
   GI BLEED -- [**Last Name **] problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding, but at
   risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and on
   steroids).  Monitor.  If Hct continues to fall, consider GI
   consultation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- unclear etiology.  Attributed to medications,
   viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of
   SDH.   Limit psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH
   drainage viable option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).
   Monitor.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <20.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds while on vasopressor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- hope to resume TPN --> may require new central
   line.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL who underwent allo-SCT and is now admitted to the MICU following a PEA arrest. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. He has tolerated spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for more than 48 hours and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with an inspiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O.

The patient's medical history includes recent large cell transformation of CLL, post-allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT), and PEA arrest. The patient has new right upper lobe (RUL) and left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrates, which are suspected to be due to aspiration. The patient is being treated for pulmonary infiltrates as aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's previous arrest was likely caused by factors such as aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, and hypovolemia. The hypotension is attributed in part to infection and pharmacological agents. The patient has experienced GI bleeding, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or medications. Monitoring for further bleeding and consultation with a GI specialist may be necessary.

The patient's altered mental status has multiple potential causes including medications, viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy, and subdural hematoma (SDH). It is unclear whether drainage of the SDH is a viable option due to severe thrombocytopenia.

   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Worsening AMS/Hypothermia: Could be infectious, possibly of a new
   source- given aspiration pneumonia and high grade BK viremia . Concern
   for fungemia in his setting with so many risk factors and an elevated
   beta glucan. CSF studies all negative including BK/[**Male First Name (un) 561**] and adenovirus.
   Patient received two doses of cidofovir so far, first on [**8-25**] and
   [**9-1**], (was pretreated in ICU with probenecid and IVF).  EEG negative
   for seizures.  Hepatic encephalopathy less likely given EEG pattern and
   waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status not correlating with LFTs prior to
   arrival.
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal > 21, plt goal > 20. Linezolid was initiated yesterday and
   although thrombocytopenia is an adverse effect, this would not be
   expected to take place sooner than 1-2wks. Patient having melanic
   stools, likely did not respond appropriately to transfusion due to
   active bleeding at the time.
   - re- check DIC labs: fibrinogen, CBC, PT, INR, PTT, FDP, Haptoglobin
   - check PM HCT, if unstable, dropping GI consult- stress ulceration vs.
   GVHD
   - T&C 2 units
   -  hold off on NGT for PO meds as pt bleeding
   -Guiaic stools
   - Restraints for now in setting of agitation
   - Continue broad coverage with meropenem and ambisome- change ambisome
   to 400mg IV q24h
   - continue linezolid 600mg IV q24h for pna
   - follow up BK virus load and Bcx, CMV and EBV PCR
   - continue haldol prn, D/C zyprexa for now as it will more diagnostic
   to use one at a time and see its effect and avoid benzos
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis when patient is less agitated
   - goals of care discussed w/ wife- > now FULL CODE (if pt acutely
   worsens would recommend re-discussing goals)
   .- neo has been weaned off
   - amio held as pt in sinus
   - continue neutropenic precautions
   # PNA- bilateral apical infiltrates could be [**12-20**] aspiration PNA
   (although RUL infiltrates are abormal for aspiration PNA could be
   possible in this patient due to positioning during code and  recumbent
   position). Daptomysin would have poor lung penetration but patient is
   also on meropenem.
   - continue linezolid IV 600mg q12h as per ID recs
   - monitor plts
   .
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**]

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) who presented to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia (PNA), pancytopenia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, and there is a concern for new sources of infection due to immunosuppression from the stem cell transplantation and ongoing immunosuppressive therapy. BK viremia and potential fungemia should also be considered.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing low levels of all blood cell types (pancytopenia), which may be due to immunosuppression, infection, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Although less likely in this case, hepatic encephalopathy should be considered given the patient's altered mental status.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of melena suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly secondary to stress ulcers or GVHD.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's use of mechanical ventilation, there is"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Worsening AMS: No significant change from yesterday, but overall
   improvement compared to several days ago.  Underlying etiology of AMS
   is unclear.  Represents the main obstacle to extubation of this
   patient.  Could be infectious, including fungemia in his setting with
   so many risk factors and an elevated beta glucan. CSF studies all
   negative including BK/[**Male First Name (un) 561**] and adenovirus. Patient received two doses of
   cidofovir so far, first on [**8-25**] and [**9-1**], (was pretreated in ICU with
   probenecid and IVF).  EEG negative for seizures.  Hepatic
   encephalopathy less likely given EEG pattern and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status not correlating with LFTs prior to arrival.
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50. Linezolid is currently day 4 which was
   added for his PNA. Patient continues to be having melanic stools, but
   Hct has remained stable at this time.
   -transfuse 1 units pRBCs. The patient remains hemodynamically stable
   and has not required any pressors.
   - Continue to check HCT [**Hospital1 **], if unstable, dropping GI consult- stress
   ulceration vs. GVHD
   - Continue broad Abx coverage with Meropenem, Linezolid (day 4 of 10
   day course for PNA) and ambisome 400mg IV q24h
   - T&C 2 units
   - Restraints for now in setting of agitation
   - follow up BK virus load and Bcx, CMV and EBV PCR
   - amio held as pt in sinus
   - continue neutropenic precautions
   # PNA- bilateral apical infiltrates could be [**12-20**] aspiration PNA
   (although RUL infiltrates are abormal for aspiration PNA could be
   possible in this patient due to positioning during code and  recumbent
   position). Started on Linezolid (currently day 4 of a 10 day total
   course).  Plt have been slowly trending down, so continue to monitor
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - continue linezolid IV 600mg q12h as per ID recs
   -F/u CXR today
   - monitor Plts and transfuse for Plt < 50
   .
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) who presented to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient also has aggressive large B-cell lymphoma. He was transferred to the MICU due to BK virus-induced nephropathy (BK viremia) and hypothermia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- The patient has shown improvement compared to several days ago, but still exhibits altered mental status (AMS) which is a significant obstacle to extubation. The underlying cause of AMS is unclear, but it could be due to infection, including possible fungemia, given the elevated beta glucan levels. CSF studies have been negative for BK virus, adenovirus, and seizures.
- Pancytopenia is present, likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. The goal hematocrit (HCT) is >25, and the platelet (plt) goal is >50.
- The patient continues to have melanic stools, but the HCT has remained stable.
- The patient remains hemodynamically stable and has not required any pressors.
- Broad antibiotic coverage with meropenem, linezolid (day 4 of a 10-day course for pneumonia), and ambisome 400mg IV q24h is being continued.
- Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) is planned. Neutropenic precautions are also ongoing.
- Restraints are being used due to agitation.
- Follow-up BK virus load and Bcx, CMV, and EBV PCR tests are scheduled.
- Amiodarone (amio) has been held as the patient is in sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Worsening AMS: The patient's altered mental status could progress, leading to further complications such as prolonged sedation, increased risk of aspiration, or development of delirium.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count increase the risk of infection, bleeding, and impaired immune function.
3. GI bleeding: The presence of melanic stools suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further investigation and intervention.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral apical infiltrates on chest X-ray raise concern for aspiration pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be maintained, and the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
5. GVHD: Given the patient's history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, there is a risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which can affect various organ systems and lead to complications such as liver dysfunction, skin rash"

   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Worsening AMS/Hypothermia: Could be infectious, possibly of a new
   source- given aspiration pneumonia and high grade BK viremia . Concern
   for fungemia in his setting with so many risk factors and an elevated
   beta glucan. CSF studies all negative including BK/[**Male First Name (un) 561**] and adenovirus.
   Patient received two doses of cidofovir so far, first on [**8-25**] and
   [**9-1**], (was pretreated in ICU with probenecid and IVF).  EEG negative
   for seizures.  Hepatic encephalopathy less likely given EEG pattern and
   waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status not correlating with LFTs prior to
   arrival.
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal > 21, plt goal > 20. Linezolid was initiated yesterday and
   although thrombocytopenia is an adverse effect, this would not be
   expected to take place sooner than 1-2wks. Patient having melanic
   stools, likely did not respond appropriately to transfusion due to
   active bleeding at the time.
   - re- check DIC labs: fibrinogen, CBC, PT, INR, PTT, FDP, Haptoglobin
   - check PM HCT, if unstable, dropping GI consult- stress ulceration vs.
   GVHD
   - T&C 2 units
   -  hold off on NGT for PO meds as pt bleeding
   -Guiaic stools
   - Restraints for now in setting of agitation
   - Continue broad coverage with meropenem and ambisome- change ambisome
   to 400mg IV q24h
   - continue linezolid 600mg IV q24h for pna
   - follow up BK virus load and Bcx, CMV and EBV PCR
   - continue haldol prn, D/C zyprexa for now as it will more diagnostic
   to use one at a time and see its effect and avoid benzos
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis when patient is less agitated
   - goals of care discussed w/ wife- > now FULL CODE (if pt acutely
   worsens would recommend re-discussing goals)
   .- neo has been weaned off
   - amio held as pt in sinus
   - continue neutropenic precautions
   # PNA- bilateral apical infiltrates could be [**12-20**] aspiration PNA
   (although RUL infiltrates are abormal for aspiration PNA could be
   possible in this patient due to positioning during code and  recumbent
   position). Daptomysin would have poor lung penetration but patient is
   also on meropenem.
   - continue linezolid IV 600mg q12h as per ID recs

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Worsening AMS: No significant change from yesterday, but overall
   improvement compared to several days ago.  Underlying etiology of AMS
   is unclear.  Represents the main obstacle to extubation of this
   patient.  Could be infectious, including fungemia in his setting with
   so many risk factors and an elevated beta glucan. CSF studies all
   negative including BK/[**Male First Name (un) 561**] and adenovirus. Patient received two doses of
   cidofovir so far, first on [**8-25**] and [**9-1**], (was pretreated in ICU with
   probenecid and IVF).  EEG negative for seizures.  Hepatic
   encephalopathy less likely given EEG pattern and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]
   mental status not correlating with LFTs prior to arrival.
   -D/c Benadryl
   -Attempt to extubate today as the pt. seems to reached a stable level
   of improvement in AMS after discussing re-intubation plans with pt.
   wife.
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50. Linezolid is currently day 4 which was
   added for his PNA. Patient continues to be having melanic stools, but
   Hct has remained stable at this time.
   - transfuse 1 units pRBCs. The patient remains hemodynamically stable
   and has not required any pressors.
   - Continue to check HCT [**Hospital1 **], if unstable, dropping GI consult- stress
   ulceration vs. GVHD
   - Continue broad Abx coverage with Meropenem, Linezolid (day 4 of 10
   day course for PNA) and ambisome 400mg IV q24h
   - continue neutropenic precautions
   - T&C 2 units
   - Restraints for now in setting of agitation
   - follow up BK virus load and Bcx, CMV and EBV PCR, pending Blood Cx
   - amio held as pt in sinus
   .
   # PNA- bilateral apical infiltrates could be [**12-20**] aspiration PNA
   (although RUL infiltrates are abormal for aspiration PNA could be
   possible in this patient due to positioning during code and  recumbent
   position). Started on Linezolid (currently day 4 of a 10 day total
   course).  Plt have been slowly trending down, so continue to monitor
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - continue linezolid IV 600mg q12h as per ID recs
   -F/u CXR today
   - monitor Plts and transfuse for Plt < 50
   .
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**]

   - follow-up any pending heme/onc recs
   #  Melena
 GVHD vs. stress ulcer; Hct has been stable
   -Continue to follow HCt [**Hospital1 **]
   - If trending down, GI consult
   - Transfuse pRBCs for Hct < 25 (1 unit pRBCs today to assist with

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma (ALCL), who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) two years ago. The patient presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's recent events include the discontinuation of benzodiazepines and olanzapine yesterday, an episode of melena this morning, and worsening hematuria with reduced urine output through his catheter. The patient's hematocrit levels have remained stable at 24.3%. The patient did not receive a central venous line (CVL) due to the ability to provide total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through his double lumen peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC).

The patient's allergies include a rash from Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim). The last doses of antibiotics administered were Ambisome at 10:09 PM on 09/13, Meropenem at 02:24 AM on 09/14, and Linezolid at 04:02 AM on 09/14.

Vital signs and flow sheet data are provided, indicating stable vital signs with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 105"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of PEA arrest.  Radigraphic
   evidence for new RUL and LUL (post) infiltrate, suspect aspiration.
   Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Extubation attempt may be
   limited by altered mental status, although mental status may now be
   back at baseline.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- new since [**2124-9-6**] and attributed to
   aspiration event.  Continue treatment as aspiration pneumonia.
   PEA ARREST -- unclear precipitant.  Concerns include aspiration with
   hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No further episodes.
   TACHYCARDIA
 likley aggition and possible hypovolemia
   (intravascular).  Plan volume expand.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Improved.
   GI BLEED -- [**Last Name **] problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding, but at
   risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and on
   steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to fall,
   consider GI consultation.
   HEMATUREIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Improved, but need to monitor.  Ambisone may
   precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- unclear etiology.  Attributed to medications,
   viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of
   SDH.   Limit psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH
   drainage viable option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).
   Monitor.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds while on vasopressor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. He has new right upper lobe (RUL) and left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrates, which are suspected to be aspiration pneumonia. The patient's mental status is variable and may be influenced by medications, viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy, or subdural hemorrhage (SDH). There are several other ongoing issues, including agitation, hypotension, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, hematuria, atrial fibrillation (A-FIB), anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension (HTN), and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The new RUL and LUL infiltrates indicate pulmonary involvement, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia. Continued monitoring and treatment of respiratory status is necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of new infiltrates suggests pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be administered based on culture and sensitivity results. Monitoring of vital signs, oxygenation, and radiographic findings is essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL who underwent allo-SCT and is now in the ICU following a PEA arrest. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient has pulmonary infiltrates attributed to aspiration, hypotension, tachycardia, agitation, and possible hypovolemia. He also has GI bleed, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and hypoglycemia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if there are further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The new right upper lobe (RUL) and left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrates suggest aspiration pneumonia. This condition could worsen if the patient aspirates again or if the pneumonia does not respond to treatment.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may recur if there is inadequate fluid resuscitation, ongoing infection, or adverse effects of medications.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may persist if the underlying cause, such as agitation or hypovolemia, is not addressed appropriately.
5. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed may reoccur"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma who underwent allo-SCT. He presented to the MICU after experiencing PEA arrest and was found to have apical infiltrates on CXR, leading to concerns of possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has pancytopenia, likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD, with a current HCT goal of >25 and plt goal of >50. He is currently being treated with broad antibiotic coverage and antifungal therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient's AMS represents the main obstacle to extubation. It could be infectious, including fungemia, given his many risk factors and elevated beta glucan levels. CSF studies have been negative, including BK virus and adenovirus. The patient received two doses of cidofovir, and EEG has been negative for seizures.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. His HCT goal is >25, and plt goal is >50. The patient is currently being transfused with 1 unit of pRBCs and will continue to be monitored.
3. PNA (Pneumonia): The patient has bilateral apical infiltrates that could be aspiration PNA. He has started on Line"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) two years ago. He presented to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was found to have apical infiltrates on chest X-ray, raising concerns for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA). He also has pancytopenia, most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.

The patient's current condition is stable, and there are no acute distress or severe symptoms noted. His vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate (105 bpm). His oxygen saturation is at 99% on ventilator support.

The patient's recent medical history includes AMS (allogeneic stem cell transplantation), hypothermia, BK viremia, PEA arrest, and apical infiltrates on chest X-ray. His allergies include Bactrim (oral), and he has received multiple antibiotics such as Linezolid, Meropenem, and Ambisome.

His lab results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function. Imaging studies reveal dense right upper lobe consolidation with volume loss, new since the previous study.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl for pain management, pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and other"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent an allo-SCT in [**2-24**]. He presented to the MICU after experiencing PEA arrest on [**9-10**] and was found to have apical infiltrates on CXR, suggesting possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient was initially intubated but has now been extubated and is stable on RA. His current condition is complicated by several issues, including worsening right upper lobe consolidation on CXR, pancytopenia, altered mental status, and hematuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's worsening right upper lobe consolidation on CXR indicates a possible worsening of aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low counts of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets put him at risk for infections, bleeding, and other hematologic complications.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's disorientation and inability to communicate effectively may indicate an underlying neurological issue or delirium. This can increase the risk of falls, aspiration, and complications related to poor airway protection.
4. Hematuria: The presence of blood in the urine can be caused by various factors, including BK cystitis, secondary to Ambisome therapy, or thromboc"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Extubated successfully.  (intubated in context
   of PEA arrest).  Radigraphic evidence for RUL and LUL (posterior)
   infiltrate, suspect aspiration pneumonia, now with evidence for RUL
   volume loss (atalectasis).
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Aspiration pneumonia, now with superimposed
   volume loss.  Continue antimicrobials.  Encourage deep breathing.  RUL
   atalectasis resolved.
   PEA ARREST -- unclear precipitant.  Concerns include aspiration with
   hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No further episodes.
   TACHYCARDIA
 likley aggition and possible hypovolemia
   (intravascular).  Monitor.
   HYPOTENSION --  Improved.  Monitor BP.
   GI BLEED -- improved.  Monitor stool guiac.
   HEMATUREIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Improved, but need to monitor.  Ambisone may
   precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- unclear etiology.  Attributed to medications,
   viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of
   SDH.   Limit psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH
   drainage viable option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).
   Monitor.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds while on vasopressor.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest (PEA arrest). The patient has been extubated successfully, but still requires respiratory support due to aspiration pneumonia and right upper lobe (RUL) volume loss or atelectasis. Other ongoing issues include hypotension, gastrointestinal bleed, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, and potential complications from previous treatments such as bone marrow transplant (BMTx) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to aspiration pneumonia and RUL volume loss. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary. Supportive measures like encouraging deep breathing exercises and possibly non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be required.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of pulmonary infiltrates suggests an ongoing infection. Antibiotics should be continued, and close monitoring for signs of worsening infection is essential.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation. Continuous cardiac monitoring is necessary, and anti-arrhythmic medications may be needed to maintain normal sinus rhythm.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to agitation,"

   - 12:48 a.m.: developed progressive bradycardia, followed by PEA
   arrest, got intubated by anesthesia, who suctioned a mucus plus. After
   1st mg of epinephrine, regained pulse. Arrest thought to be [**12-20**] mucous
   plugging, although patient had normal O2 sat prior to arrest
   - had episodes of bradycardia throughout the night
   At 1248 am, Pt noted to be HTN to SBP 190s and bradycardia. Over the
   period of one minute pt became progressively bradycardic to 20s and
   then went into pulseless Vtach. Code blue was called. CPR was started.
   By the time pads were applied to the patient he had transitioned to
   PEA. 1mg epi was given. IVF were started wide open. Pulse returned and
   CPR was stoped. Pt was intubated with 8 ET. Femoral line was placed in
   R groin. During intubation a large quanitiy of mucous / plug was
   suctioned. BP was undetectable but recoved with MAP > 110 prior
   begining pressors. CXR was obtained, which showed increased prominance
   of haziness in Left lung but no edema. lactate 2.6, ABG with metabolic
   and respiratoy acidosis. Wife was [**Name (NI) 167**] and is on her way to the

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with a history of CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) two years ago. He presented to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [**9-10**], with apical infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR) concerning for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and pancytopenia.

The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement and worsening. Some of the potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Aspiration PNA: The patient's recent PEA arrest is believed to be caused by aspiration of mucous plugging. He is currently stable on RA (respiratory assistance), but there is a worsening right upper lobe (RUL) consolidation on CXR, indicating a possible infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

2. Altered Mental Status (MS): The patient's mental status has improved since extubation but still shows signs of confusion. This could be due to several factors such as sedating medications, infection (e.g., BK viremia), or other underlying causes. Avoiding sedating medications and frequent orientation may help improve his mental status.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) approximately 2-24 weeks ago. He presented to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [**9-10**] with apical infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR), which raised concerns for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient was intubated, and subsequent tests revealed pancytopenia, likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. He also has mucositis, as evidenced by scleral edema and poor dentition, and is at risk for further aspiration due to altered mental status (AMS) and extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's history of AMS, recent extubation, and worsening right upper lobe (RUL) consolidation on CXR indicate a high risk for recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring and aspiration precautions are necessary.
2. BK Viremia: The patient has an undetermined etiology for altered mental status, with suspicion of BK viremia. Frequent orientation and avoidance of sedating medications are recommended.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may be due to immunosuppression, infection, or graft-vers"

","The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma post allo SCT, who experienced cardiac arrest in the ICU. The patient's recent history includes AMS and hypothermia, as well as BK viremia. The patient's current condition includes recurrent bradycardia, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Mucus plugging/aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recurrent bradycardia and hypoxemia could be due to mucus plugging or aspiration pneumonia. This is a serious complication in intubated patients and can lead to respiratory failure.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient's previous cardiac arrest and hypertension/bradycardia may indicate intrinsic cardiac pathology or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) or seizures. Further cardiac enzymes and consultation with cardiology may be necessary to rule out any cardiac-related complications.

3. Neurologic issues: The patient's altered mental status and history of subdural hematomas raise concerns for elevated ICP or seizures. A head CT scan should be performed to evaluate for any new changes or worsening of existing conditions.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, which is likely due to immunosuppression, infection, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Close monitoring and transfusion of blood products may be required to manage this"

   concerning for elevated ICP, particularly in the setting of known

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allo SCT (allogeneic stem cell transplantation) 2-24 weeks ago. He presented to the MICU after experiencing cardiac arrest on [9-10] and has had recurrent cardiac arrest in the early a.m. on [2124-9-16]. The patient's current condition includes being intubated and sedated, with a recent aspiration pneumonia and worsening right upper lobe consolidation on chest X-ray. He also has altered mental status, pancytopenia, and multiple complications related to his underlying medical conditions and immunosuppressive therapy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's current condition include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent cardiac arrest and aspiration pneumonia indicate a risk of respiratory failure due to mucus plugging and volume loss.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to CLL, BMT, and GVHD increases the risk of infection, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia puts him at risk for bleeding, especially with the presence of melena and hematuria.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is concerning, with positive fluid intake and output, indicating potential fluid overload or dehydration.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's melena may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding,"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo SCT) and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Aspiration pneumonia (AP): The patient developed bradycardia and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely caused by aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated and received epinephrine to regain pulse. Despite improvement, the patient has worsening right upper lobe (RUL) consolidation on chest X-ray (CXR). The possibility of mucous plugging with volume loss is being considered over worsening infiltrate. The patient should continue broad coverage with Ambisome, linezolid, and Vancomycin. Trending CXR and aspiration precautions are also recommended.

2. Altered mental status (AMS): Since extubation, the patient's mental status has improved, and he is making eye contact. However, he is moaning without coherent words, which was baseline during his last ICU admission. The etiology of AMS remains unclear, possibly related to BK viremia. Avoiding sedating medications and frequent orientation are advised.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with CLL (large cell transformation) now s/p second
   cardiac arrest.
   Cardiac arrest
   Event last night appears to have been bradycardia, then VT
   (?polymorphic), then narrow-complex PEA.  Although there was a mucus
   plug extracted, there were documented normal oxygen saturations pre and
   post.
   Although mucus plug is probably the most likely event, there are some
   atypical factors.  We will plan:
   CT head to evaluate for changes in SDH
   CT / PE protocol to exclude pulmonary embolism
   Consult cardiology for assistance in rhythm evaluation.  Consider echo.
   Respiratory failure
   Extremely hypoxemic.  Will move toward ventilation at low tidal volumes
   as if developing ARDS.
   Arterial line today (team overnight unable to place)
   Possible pneumonia / Pulmonary infiltrates
   Continue present ABX today.  Get sputum cultures.
   GI BLEED
   Improved.  Monitor stool guiac.  Transfuse today.
   HEMATURiA
   Previously attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Improved, but need to monitor.  Ambisone may
   precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   A-FIB
   off amiodarone.  Monitor HR.
   CLL
   s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic
   regimens.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
   Attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. Will transfuse for plts
   <50.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
   On TPN via PICC.  Will discuss enteral nutrition with Onc.

   Addendum
   Discussion held with pt
s wife by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21**], Mr. [**Known lastname 9130**]
s primary
   oncologist.  They agreed that we would continue present approach to
   treatment, but that if the situation worsened would plan to not
   escalate care.  For example, shock that requires vasopressors would be
   viewed as escalation.  In addition, no CPR or shock in case of arrest.
   Procedure: Ultrasound-guided arterial catheterization
   Indication: respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring
   Operator: [**Location (un) **]
   After consent from wife, site prepped and draped with full barrier
   precautions.  Real-time ultrasound guidance used given prior
   unsuccessful attempts.  Radial artery visualized proximal to wrist.
   Single pass with 20g arrow device with integral wire.  No
   complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL (large cell transformation) who experienced a second cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition is critical, and multiple medical complications can arise. Some potential complications that can be identified from the note include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is extremely hypoxemic, indicating severe oxygen deficiency in the blood. This could be due to pneumonia or pulmonary infiltrates, which are mentioned as possible causes.

2. GI bleed: The patient had an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding, but it has improved. However, monitoring for further bleeding is necessary, especially with the use of medications like Ambisome, which may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.

3. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria previously attributed to Foley catheter trauma in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Although it has improved, monitoring is still needed.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. Platelet transfusion will be given for platelet counts below 50.

5. A-fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation and is off amiodarone. Monitoring of the heart rate is necessary.

6. CLL: The patient has CLL and has undergone bone marrow transplantation (BMTx) with subsequent GVHD. Immunosuppressive and prophylactic reg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL (large cell transformation) who experienced a second cardiac arrest. He has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The event last night involved bradycardia, then VT (possibly polymorphic), followed by narrow-complex PEA. Although a mucus plug was extracted, there were documented normal oxygen saturations before and after. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, possible pneumonia/pulmonary infiltrates, GI bleed, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, CLL post BMTx with GVHD, thrombocytopenia, and nutritional support. The patient's condition remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is extremely hypoxemic and requires ventilation. There is a concern for developing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
2. Possible Pneumonia/Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient may have pulmonary infiltrates, which could be indicative of pneumonia. Sputum cultures should be obtained, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued.
3. GI Bleed: The patient had a GI bleed, which has improved but should be monitored closely. Stool guiac testing should be done, and if necessary, transfusion should be considered.
4. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria was initially attributed to Foley catheter trauma due to thrombocyt"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (allo SCT). The patient presented with hypothermia and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), leading to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient's current condition includes worsening right upper lobe (RUL) consolidation on chest X-ray, indicating possible aspiration pneumonia (APNA). He has also shown signs of pancytopenia, likely due to immunosuppression, infection, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count are below the target levels, necessitating transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and platelets.

Other notable findings include altered mental status, possibly related to BK viremia or other causes, and moaning without coherent words. The patient's bleeding manifestations, such as melena and hematuria, need further evaluation to determine the underlying cause, which could be GVHD or stress ulcers. The patient's nutritional support has been initiated through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's worsening RUL consolidation suggests a possible respiratory infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation into aggressive large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) in February 24th with acute myocardial syndrome (AMS) and hypothermia. He was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on September 10th, with apical infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR) concerning for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and pancytopenia.

The patient has shown improvement clinically, but now has worsening right upper lobe (RUL) consolidation on CXR. This could be due to mucous plugging with volume loss rather than worsening infiltrate. The patient remains on broad coverage with Ambisome, linezolid, and gentamicin. Trending CXR and aspiration precautions are recommended.

The patient also exhibits altered mental status (MS), which has improved since extubation. He is making eye contact and moaning without coherent words. The etiology of this altered MS remains unclear, possibly related to BK viremia. Avoidance of sedating medications and frequent orientation are advised.

Pancytopenia is most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. HCT goal is greater than 25 and plt goal is greater than 50. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Hypotension : Pt. requiring increasing amounts of fluids to keep BPs
   up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.  He is DNR and off
   pressors.  Given this long ICU stay, he is likely to have adrenal
   insufficiency, so will start the patient on stress dose steroids to
   keep BPs elevated.  Will continue treatment with Abx for now
   -Stress dose steroids
   -LR boluses as needed to keep MAP>60 / SBP>90 (use LR given decreased
   bicarb and hyperchloremia and decreased anion gap).
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem given continued
   hypothermia, hypotension, radiographic evidence of likely infectious
   process on CXR
   -F/u ID recs
   -Switch from Fentalyl boluses to Fentanyl drip 25-50 mcg/hr for
   sedation
   -F/u CT brain to assess for extension of subdural hematoma
   -F/u CTA chest to evelaute for PE given high risk patient, not on
   anticoagulation due to pancytopenia
   # Aspiration PNA : On a most recent CXR, has an enlarging right-sided
   pleural effusion (possibly due to fluid excess) vs. RLL consolidation
   and increasing builbasilar atelectasis. Most recent episode of
   Polymorphic VTach likely secondary to mucous plugging with volume loss,
   even though the patient did not desat during that episode.  EBV viral
   load negative
   - continue broad coverage with Ambisome, Linezolid, and Meropenem
   - appreciate continued ID recs.
   - trend CXR daily
   -D/c Femoral line today as it is a high source of infection.  Obtain
   PIV access.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50.   Pt. responded appropriately to
   transfusions yesterday.
   -Continue to trend Hct and Plt closely and transfuse for above goals
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate BMT  recs
   #  Melena
 GVHD vs. stress ulcer; Hct has been stable.
   -Continue to follow HCt [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse pRBCs for Hct < 25 (1 unit pRBCs today)
   # Hematuria
 Etiology is BK cystitis vs. secondary to Ambisome vs
   thrombocytopenia .  Improved with irrigation, but continues to be
   hematuric
   - titrate off CBI
   - continue ambisome at lower dose.
   - replete Plt as above
   .
   # Nutrition
Continue TPN via double lumen PICC.  Will try to get PIV
   for additional access.
   -TPN via double lumen
   -Re-start tube feeds as tolerated via OG tube.  D/c TPN if nutrition
   goals are met with the tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and allo SCT (bone marrow transplant) who is currently in the ICU due to multiple medical complications. The patient has experienced PEA arrest, aspiration pneumonia, pancytopenia, hypotension, and hypothermia. He has an enlarged right-sided pleural effusion and increasing bilateral atelectasis on chest X-ray. The patient's condition is complicated by BK viremia, GVHD (graft-versus-host disease), and potential stress ulcer or melena. The patient's lab results show abnormal values for WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, TropT, TCO2, Glucose, and other electrolyte levels. The patient is sedated and unresponsive to voice commands, but his blood pressure is stable and he is oxygenating well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires increasing amounts of fluids to maintain blood pressure, suggesting possible adrenal insufficiency. Stress dose steroids may be necessary to keep blood pressures elevated.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ambisome, Linezolid, and Meropenem) due to continued hypothermia, hypotension, and radiographic evidence of an infectious process on CXR. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia, as well as the possibility of PE (pulmonary embolism).
3. Pancytopenia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent allo SCT in the past and is currently in the ICU for PEA arrest and apical infiltrates on CXR, concerning for possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia. The patient has been hypotensive and requires increasing amounts of fluids to keep blood pressures up. Given the long ICU stay, adrenal insufficiency is likely, so stress dose steroids have been started to keep blood pressures elevated. Antibiotics have been continued for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires increasing amounts of fluids to maintain adequate blood pressure, indicating ongoing hypotension. This can be a result of sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or other underlying conditions. Hypotension can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's long ICU stay and need for stress dose steroids suggest the possibility of adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency can lead to hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased immune response.

3. Infection: The patient has ongoing infection, as evidenced by the need for continued broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ambisome, Linezolid, Meropenem). Infection can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

4. Aspiration pneumonia (AP): The patient has an enlarging right"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma post-allogeneic stem cell transplant. He experienced a PEA arrest on 9/10 and was transferred to the MICU. He has apical infiltrates on CXR, raising concerns for aspiration pneumonia and pancytopenia. The patient requires increasing amounts of IV fluids to maintain blood pressure, resulting in a significantly positive fluid balance. He is DNR and receiving stress dose steroids. Antibiotics have been continued due to ongoing hypotension and radiographic evidence of an infectious process on CXR.

The patient also has pancytopenia, likely due to immunosuppression, infection, or GVHD. His HCT and plt levels are being closely monitored, and transfusions are being given to maintain target goals. The patient has a history of CLL with BMT complicated by GVHD. Immunosuppressive medications are being continued, and prophylactic regimens are in place.

The patient is experiencing melena, which could be due to GVHD or stress ulcers. His HCT has been stable, and he has been transfused with pRBCs for a Hct < 25. He also has hematuria, possibly caused by BK cystitis, secondary to Ambisome, or thrombocytopenia. Irrigation has improved his condition, and he is still hematuric. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Hypotension : Pt. requiring increasing amounts of fluids to keep BPs
   up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.  He is DNR and off
   pressors.  On stress dose-steroids.  Will continue treatment with Abx
   for now
   -Continue methylprednisolone
   -LR boluses as needed to keep MAP>60 / SBP>90 (use LR given decreased
   bicarb and hyperchloremia and decreased anion gap).
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem given continued
   hypothermia, hypotension, radiographic evidence of likely infectious
   process on CXR
   -F/u ID recs
   -Switch from Fentalyl boluses to Fentanyl drip 25-50 mcg/hr for
   sedation
   -F/u CT brain to assess for extension of subdural hematoma
   -F/u CTA chest to evelaute for PE given high risk patient, not on
   anticoagulation due to pancytopenia
   # Aspiration PNA : On a most recent CXR, has an enlarging right-sided
   pleural effusion (possibly due to fluid excess) vs. RLL consolidation
   and increasing builbasilar atelectasis. Most recent episode of
   Polymorphic VTach likely secondary to mucous plugging with volume loss,
   even though the patient did not desat during that episode.  EBV viral
   load negative
   - continue broad coverage with Ambisome, Linezolid, and Meropenem
   - appreciate continued ID recs.
   - trend CXR daily
   -D/c Femoral line today as it is a high source of infection.  Obtain
   PIV access.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50.   Pt. responded appropriately to
   transfusions yesterday.
   -Continue to trend Hct and Plt closely and transfuse for above goals
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate BMT  recs
   #  Melena
 GVHD vs. stress ulcer; Hct has been stable.
   -Continue to follow HCt [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse pRBCs for Hct < 25 (1 unit pRBCs today)
   # Hematuria
 Etiology is BK cystitis vs. secondary to Ambisome vs
   thrombocytopenia .  Improved with irrigation, but continues to be
   hematuric
   - titrate off CBI
   - continue ambisome at lower dose.
   - replete Plt as above
   .
   # Nutrition
Continue TPN via double lumen PICC.  Will try to get PIV
   for additional access.
   -TPN via double lumen
   -Re-start tube feeds as tolerated via OG tube.  D/c TPN if nutrition
   goals are met with the tube feeds.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT). He presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, pancytopenia, aspiration pneumonia (AP), and potential pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient requires increasing amounts of intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure (BP), indicating ongoing hypotension. Stress doses of steroids have been initiated due to suspected adrenal dysfunction. LR boluses will be given as needed to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and systolic BP above 90 mmHg.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Ambisome, Linezolid, and Meropenem, for the treatment of possible infections. A CT scan of the brain has been ordered to assess for extension of the subdural hematoma. Additionally, a CT angiography (CTA) of the chest is recommended to evaluate for PE, considering the patient's high risk profile and lack of anticoagulation due to pancytopenia.

The patient also has evidence of an enlarging right-sided pleural effusion, possibly due to fluid excess, as well as increasing bilateral basilar atelectasis. These"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Reintubated in context of PEA arrest.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Complete treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   PEA ARREST -- Repeated.  Unclear precipitant, although concern remains
   aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No
   further episodes.
   BRADYCARDIA
 Possible vagal etiology.  Monitor HR.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Plan continue iv fluid bolus.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Attributed to medications, viremia, possible
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of SDH.   Limit
   psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH drainage viable
   option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).  Monitor.
   GI BLEED -- [**Last Name **] problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding, but at
   risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and on
   steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to fall,
   consider GI consultation.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Ambisone may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   Improved with irrigation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- total body volume hyperexpanded, but intravascular marginal.
   Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds.  Monitor BP.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- hope to resume TPN via PICC --> may require new
   central line.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including respiratory failure, pulmonary infiltrates, bradycardia, hypotension, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and hypoglycemia.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to reintubation in the context of PEA arrest and the presence of pulmonary infiltrates. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation.

The patient's bradycardia is being monitored, and possible causes such as vagal stimulation are being considered. Hypotension is attributed to infection and pharmacological agents. The patient has received an IV fluid bolus, and the plan is to continue monitoring.

Altered mental status is attributed to medications, viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy, and the presence of subdural hematoma (SDH). It is unclear whether SDH drainage is viable due to severe thrombocytopenia. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may be related to previous oral bleeding, but there is a risk of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), graft-versus"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Reintubated in context of PEA arrest.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Complete treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   PEA ARREST -- Repeated.  Unclear precipitant, although concern remains
   aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No
   further episodes.
   BRADYCARDIA
 Possible vagal etiology.  Monitor HR.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Plan continue iv fluid bolus.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Attributed to medications, viremia, possible
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of SDH.   Limit
   psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH drainage viable
   option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).  Monitor.
   GI BLEED -- [**Last Name **] problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding, but at
   risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and on
   steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to fall,
   consider GI consultation.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Ambisone may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   Improved with irrigation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- total body volume hyperexpanded, but intravascular marginal.
   Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds.  Monitor BP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL who underwent allo SCT and is now admitted to the ICU following a PEA arrest. He has respiratory failure requiring reintubation and mechanical ventilation. He also has pulmonary infiltrates, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia, which was possibly caused by vagal stimulation. He is hypotensive, attributed to infection and pharmacological agents. The patient has altered mental status, likely due to medications, viremia, possible hepatic encephalopathy, and a subdural hematoma. He has a history of GI bleed, hematuria caused by Foley catheter trauma, atrial fibrillation, and hypoglycemia. The patient's fluid status is complicated, with total body volume hyperexpansion but marginal intravascular volume. He has anemia and thrombocytopenia, both likely secondary to immunosuppression and recent blood loss. The patient has hypertension, which requires monitoring. His nutritional support is via TPN through a PICC line. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires continued mechanical ventilation to support his breathing.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates, which may indicate aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Bradycardia: The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia, which could be recurrent or triggered by various factors such as medications or stress.
4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which can compromise his organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications, including sepsis and organ dysfunction.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to medications, viremia, hepatic encephalopathy, or a subdural hematoma. It is important to monitor his mental status and adjust medication dosages if possible.
6. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which can recur, especially while on corticosteroids and NPO status. Monitoring for melena and hematemesis is crucial.
7. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria likely due to Foley catheter trauma. This could be a temporary issue, but close monitoring for signs of bleeding is necessary.
8. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had atrial fibrillation, which can lead to the formation of blood clots and increase the risk of stroke or other cardiovascular complications.
9. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced episodes of hypoglycemia, likely due to insulin in TPN. This highlights the need for careful monitoring of blood glucose levels.
10. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a prolonged cardiac arrest (PEA arrest). The patient has been reintubated due to respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. He also has pulmonary infiltrates, which are being treated for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, altered mental status, GI bleed, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if there are complications with mechanical ventilation or if the pulmonary infiltrates worsen.
2. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to immunosuppression from the stem cell transplant and ongoing treatment. This could lead to sepsis and further organ dysfunction.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed and thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential to prevent hemorrhagic complications.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension may persist or worsen, leading to inadequate organ perfusion and potential shock.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's hematuria may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma post-allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT). He presented to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, sepsis, pancytopenia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics due to his immunocompromised state and ongoing infection. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction. His current medications include stress-dose steroids, antifungals (Ambisome, Linezolid), and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Meropenem). The patient's prognosis is guarded due to his multiple comorbidities, immunosuppression, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already exhibiting signs of sepsis, which may progress if not promptly and effectively treated.
2. Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing infection, there is a risk of MODS involving multiple organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, and heart.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia puts him at risk"

   Chief Complaint:
   The patient received  2 bags of platelets  with the appropriate
   response to 117.
   An attempt was made to wean propofol, but the patient appeared
   uncomfortable and there was a risk of him pulling the line.
   TTE performed yesterday, which showed dilated and hypokinetic RV.
   There was nursing concern for anisocoria this AM, but on further
   examination it was determined that the pupils are equal and reactive to
   light.

   [**Name (NI) 36**] status: DNR (no pressors, no compression) per most recent
   discussion with HCP
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with a history of CLL and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) 2-24 weeks ago. He experienced AMS and hypothermia in the setting of BK viremia.
- The patient was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [9-10], with apical infiltrates on CXR, raising concerns for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA).
- The patient has pancytopenia, likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
- He has been treated with increasing amounts of fluids to keep blood pressures up, resulting in a significantly positive fluid balance.
- The patient is DNR and off pressors. He is receiving stress-dose steroids and will continue treatment with antibiotics.
- New neurological findings on examination raise the possibility of a subdural re-bleed and seizure activity.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring, including frequent assessment of vital signs, hemodynamic status, respiratory status, and laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient requires increasing amounts of fluids to maintain blood pressures, indicating potential hypotension and sepsis. Close monitoring of fluid balance and hemodynamic status is crucial.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of apical infiltrates on CXR raises concerns for possible aspiration pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Reintubated in context of PEA arrest.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Suspect poor candidate to work
   towards repeat extubation trial in setting of markedly abnormal mental
   status.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   Would encourage discontinue select antimicrobials.
   PEA ARREST -- Repeated.  Unclear precipitant, although concern remains
   aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No
   further episodes.
   BRADYCARDIA
 Possible vagal etiology.  Monitor HR.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Plan continue iv fluid bolus.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Attributed to medications, viremia, possible
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of SDH.   Limit
   psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH drainage viable
   option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).  Monitor.
   FACIAL TWITCHING -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   toxic-metabolic derrangement, or seizure.  In context of altered mental
   status, would consider repeat head CT and check EEG.  Discuss with
   Neurology service.
   ELEVATED b-GLUCAN -- concern for ongoing fungal infection.  Continue
   antifungals.  Await g-glactomannan.
   GI BLEED -- [**Last Name **] problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding, but at
   risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and on
   steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to fall,
   consider GI consultation.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Ambisone may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   Improved with irrigation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- total body volume hyperexpanded, but intravascular marginal.
   Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds.  Monitor BP.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) and is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient remains intubated on mechanical ventilation and is sedated.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pulmonary infiltrates, bradycardia, hypotension, altered mental status, facial twitching, elevated b-glucan levels indicating a possible fungal infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's medical history includes CLL transformation into large cell lymphoma, subsequent allo-SCT, and current issues with poor mental status, infection, and hepatic encephalopathy.

The plan for the patient includes continuing mechanical ventilation, monitoring heart rate, administering intravenous fluids, limiting psychotropic medications, and considering repeat head CT and EEG due to facial twitching. The patient's elevated b-glucan levels suggest ongoing fungal infection, so antifungals should be continued. Additionally, the patient's hematological parameters indicate anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be attributed to immunosuppression, infection, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Close monitoring of blood counts and appropriate transfusions should be considered.

Overall, the patient's critical illness necessitates careful management of"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Reintubated in context of PEA arrest.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Suspect poor candidate to work
   towards repeat extubation trial in setting of markedly abnormal mental
   status.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   Would encourage discontinue select antimicrobials.
   PEA ARREST -- Repeated.  Unclear precipitant, although concern remains
   aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No
   further episodes.
   BRADYCARDIA
 Possible vagal etiology.  Monitor HR.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Plan continue iv fluid bolus.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Attributed to medications, viremia, possible
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of SDH.   Limit
   psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear whether SDH drainage viable
   option (in context of severe thrombocytopenia).  Monitor.
   FACIAL TWITCHING -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   toxic-metabolic derrangement, or seizure.  In context of altered mental
   status, would consider repeat head CT and check EEG.  Discuss with
   Neurology service.
   ELEVATED b-GLUCAN -- concern for ongoing fungal infection.  Continue
   antifungals.  Await g-glactomannan.
   GI BLEED -- [**Last Name **] problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding, but at
   risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and on
   steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to fall,
   consider GI consultation.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Ambisone may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   Improved with irrigation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- total body volume hyperexpanded, but intravascular marginal.
   Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds.  Monitor BP.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 desire resuming TF via OGT.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (allo SCT). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He exhibits signs of altered mental status, facial twitching, hypothermia, and hypotension.

The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, for which treatment has been completed. There are concerns about the underlying cause of the PEA arrest, including aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, and hypovolemia. Bradycardia is also present, possibly due to vagal stimulation. The patient has ongoing infections, as indicated by elevated b-glucan levels, and there is a concern for ongoing fungal infection. GI bleeding may be related to peptic ulcer disease (PUD), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or other gastrointestinal pathology. Hematuria was attributed to foley catheter trauma but improved with irrigation. The patient's CLL transformed into large cell lymphoma post BMTx and is at risk for GVHD.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is expected to continue on mechanical ventilation. It is uncertain if the patient will be a candidate for another extubation trial due to his markedly abnormal mental status.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Hypotension/sepsis: Pt. requiring increasing amounts of fluids to
   keep BPs up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.  He is DNR
   and off pressors.  On stress dose-steroids.  Will continue treatment
   with Abx.  Given new neurological findings on exam, will evaluate for
   possible subdural re-bleed and seizure activity.
   -Continue methylprednisolone
   -LR boluses as needed to keep MAP>60 / SBP>90 (use LR given decreased
   bicarb and hyperchloremia and decreased anion gap).
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem given continued
   hypothermia, hypotension, radiographic evidence of likely infectious
   process on CXR.  Discuss with ID antibiotic courses.
   -F/u ID recs
   -Increase Haldol dose to 1mg q6hours in order to attempt to wean off
   Propofol given hypotension
   -F/u EKG to assess QTc given Haldol
   -F/u B-Glucan (last value >500 on [**2124-9-14**])
   -F/u fungal blood culture
   -f/u NCHCT
   -Re-consult Neuro re: seizure activity
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50.   Pt. responded appropriately to
   transfusions yesterday.
   -Continue to trend Hct and Plt closely and transfuse for above goals
   - f/u PM Hct given Hct continuing to slowly trend down
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate BMT recs
   #  Melena
 GVHD vs. stress ulcer; Hct has been slowly trending down.
   - Continue to follow HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse pRBCs for Hct < 25
   # Hematuria
 Etiology is BK cystitis vs. secondary to Ambisome vs
   thrombocytopenia .  Improved with irrigation, but continues to be
   hematuric
   - continue CBI
   - continue ambisome at lower dose.

   discussion with HCP
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and transformation into aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent allo SCT. He presented to the ICU with AMS and hypothermia in the setting of BK viremia, following a PEA arrest. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension/sepsis, pancytopenia, GVHD, melena, and hematuria.

The patient's current medications include propofol, fentanyl, pantoprazole, haloperidol, Ambisome, linezolid, meropenem, clindamycin, pyrimethamine, and leucovorin.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient is experiencing increasing amounts of fluids to keep blood pressures up, indicating ongoing hypotension. The presence of infection is suggested by the administration of antibiotics (Ambisome, linezolid, meropenem) and the need for continued aggressive fluid resuscitation. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen the patient's condition.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has decreased counts of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can be due to immunosuppression, infection, or GVHD. Pancytopenia increases the risk of infections, bleeding, and other complications related to inadequate cell counts.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Hypotension/sepsis: Pt. requiring increasing amounts of fluids to
   keep BPs up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.  He is DNR
   and off pressors.  On stress dose-steroids.  Will continue treatment
   with Abx.
   -Continue methylprednisolone
   -LR boluses as needed to keep MAP>60 / SBP>90 (use LR given decreased
   bicarb and hyperchloremia and decreased anion gap).
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem given continued
   hypothermia, hypotension.
   -Continue treatment for Tooplasmosis with Pyrimethium, Leucovorin,
   Clindamycin.
   -F/u ID recs, BMT recs.
   -Continue Haldol dose to 1mg q6hours and start low dose Zydis in order
   to attempt to wean off Propofol given hypotension
   -F/u EKG to assess QTc given Haldol
   -F/u B-Glucan (last value >500 on [**2124-9-14**])
   -F/u fungal blood culture
   -f/u NCHCT final read
   -Per Neuro recs, MRI of head to look for anoxic brain injury,
   infectious etilogy, white matter changes associated with BK viremia,
   etc to help with management and prognosis.
   -EEG to r/u status epilepticus
   -A trial of PS 5/5 ventilation.
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50.
   -Continue to trend Hct and Plt closely and transfuse for above goals
   - f/u PM Hct given Hct and Plt continuing to slowly trend down
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate BMT recs
   #  Melena
 GVHD vs. stress ulcer; Hct has been slowly trending down.
   - Continue to follow HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse pRBCs for Hct < 25
   # Hematuria
 Etiology is BK cystitis vs. secondary to Ambisome vs
   thrombocytopenia .  Improved with irrigation, but continues to be
   hematuric
   - continue CBI.

   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments: with patient and wife
   [**Name (NI) 36**] status: DNR (no pressors, no compression) per most recent
   discussion with HCP
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) but developed acute myocardial syndrome (AMS) and hypothermia. The patient also had BK virusemia, which led to his transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and is receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia and pancytopenia. He is also being treated for toxoplasmosis with pyrimethamine, leucovorin, and clindamycin. The patient has been sedated with propofol and is on stress-dose steroids. 

His current vital signs show a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/70 to 84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His temperature is slightly below normal at 36.3 degrees Celsius. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. His electrolytes show hyperchloremia, and his kidney function tests reveal a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Reintubated in context of PEA arrest.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Suspect poor candidate to work
   towards repeat extubation trial in setting of markedly abnormal mental
   status.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   Would encourage discontinue select antimicrobials.
   PEA ARREST -- Repeated.  Unclear precipitant, although concern remains
   aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No
   further episodes.
   BRADYCARDIA
 Possible vagal etiology.  Monitor HR.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to infection and to pharmacological
   agents.  Plan continue iv fluid bolus.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Attributed to medications, viremia, possible
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of SDH --> no evidence for
   progression of SDH.   Limit psychotropic meds if possible.   Unclear
   whether SDH drainage viable option (in context of severe
   thrombocytopenia).  Monitor.  Consider EEG (assess for status
   epilepticus) and head MRI (assess for anoxic brain injury) to further
   evaluate neurological status.
   FACIAL TWITCHING -- unclear etiology, but concerns include
   toxic-metabolic derrangement, or seizure.  In context of altered mental
   status, would consider repeat head CT and check EEG.  Discuss with
   Neurology service.
   ELEVATED b-GLUCAN -- concern for ongoing fungal infection.  Continue
   antifungals.  Await g-glactomannan.
   GI BLEED -- [**Last Name **] problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding, but at
   risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and on
   steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to fall,
   consider GI consultation.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Ambisone may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   Improved with irrigation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- episodic.  Attributed to insulin in TPN, now
   discontinued.  Possible related to ongoing infections.
   FLUIDS -- total body volume hyperexpanded, but intravascular marginal.
   Monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds.  Monitor BP.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (allo SCT) and is now in the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has had multiple complications including pulmonary infiltrates, cardiac arrest, bradycardia, hypotension, altered mental status, facial twitching, elevated beta-glucan levels, gastrointestinal bleed, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and nutritional support issues.

The patient's current condition includes being intubated and mechanically ventilated, sedated, and on a warming blanket. He has been treated empirically for toxoplasmosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 96/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.7 thousand/mL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 35 thousand/mL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal renal function tests.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pulmonary infiltrates, bradycardia, hypotension, altered mental status, facial twitching, elevated b-glucan, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and hypoglycemia.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient is mechanically ventilated due to reintubation in the context of PEA arrest. It is planned to continue mechanical ventilation, and the patient is considered a poor candidate for extubation trials due to markedly abnormal mental status.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates - The patient has completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia and may benefit from discontinuing select antimicrobials.
3. PEA Arrest - The patient had repeated episodes of PEA arrest, which improved but the underlying cause remains unclear. No further episodes occurred.
4. Bradycardia - Possible vagal etiology, monitor heart rate.
5. Hypotension - Attributed to infection and pharmacological agents, plan to continue intravenous fluid bolus.

   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Hypotension/sepsis: Pt. requiring increasing amounts of fluids to
   keep BPs up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.  He is DNR
   and off pressors.  On stress dose-steroids.  Will continue treatment
   with Abx.
   -Continue methylprednisolone
   -LR boluses as needed to keep MAP>60 / SBP>90 (use LR given decreased
   bicarb and hyperchloremia and decreased anion gap).
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem given continued
   hypothermia, hypotension.
   -Continue treatment for Tooplasmosis with Pyrimethium, Leucovorin,
   Clindamycin.
   -F/u ID recs, BMT recs.
   -Continue Haldol dose to 1mg q6hours and start low dose Zydis in order
   to attempt to wean off Propofol given hypotension
   -F/u EKG to assess QTc given Haldol
   -F/u B-Glucan (last value >500 on [**2124-9-14**])
   -F/u fungal blood culture
   -f/u NCHCT final read
   -Per Neuro recs, MRI of head to look for anoxic brain injury,
   infectious etilogy, white matter changes associated with BK viremia,
   etc to help with management and prognosis.
   -EEG to r/u status epilepticus
   -A trial of PS 5/5 ventilation.
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50.
   -Continue to trend Hct and Plt closely and transfuse for above goals
   - f/u PM Hct given Hct and Plt continuing to slowly trend down
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate BMT recs
   #  Melena
 GVHD vs. stress ulcer; Hct has been slowly trending down.
   - Continue to follow HCT [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with CLL and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) in [**2-24**] and experienced AMS and hypothermia. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) after experiencing pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [**9-10**], with apical infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR) concerning for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and pancytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires increasing amounts of fluids to keep blood pressures up. There is a significantly positive fluid balance, indicating fluid overload. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx). It is important to continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and monitor for signs of organ dysfunction.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. The hematocrit (HCT) goal is >25, and the platelet (plt) goal is >50. Close monitoring of HCT and plt levels is crucial, and transfusion should be considered to achieve these goals.

3. CLL with BMT c/b GVHD: The patient has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Reintubated in context of PEA arrest.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Suspect poor candidate to work
   towards repeat extubation trial in setting of markedly abnormal mental
   status.  Would assess for tracheostomy, and discuss options with wife.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   Would encourage discontinue select antimicrobials.
   PEA ARREST -- Repeated.  Unclear precipitant, although concern remains
   aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No
   further episodes.
   BRADYCARDIA
 Possible vagal etiology.  Monitor HR.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Attributed to medications, viremia, possible
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of SDH --> no evidence for
   progression of SDH.   Current head MRI demonstrates bilateral frontal
   hygromas, perhaps expanding --> Limit psychotropic meds if possible.
   Unclear whether SDH drainage viable option (in context of severe
   thrombocytopenia).  Monitor.  Elevated NH3.  Consider EEG (assess for
   status epilepticus) and head MRI (assess for anoxic brain injury) to
   further evaluate neurological status.  Neurosurgical consultation RE:
   management of SDH and expanding hygroma.
   FACIAL TWITCHING -- Transient, and resolved.  Unclear etiology, but
   concerns include toxic-metabolic derrangement, or seizure.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   attributed to Propofol.  Await EEG.
   ELEVATED NH3
 desire to treat with lactulose, but hold while
   evaluating for GI bleed.  Monitor NH3, LFTs.
   ELEVATED b-GLUCAN -- concern for ongoing fungal infection.  Continue
   antifungals.  Await g-glactomannan.
   GI BLEED -- Recurrent problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding,
   but at risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and
   on steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to
   fall, consider GI consultation.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   FLUIDS -- total body volume hyperexpanded, but intravascular marginal.
   Desure net negative fluid balance.  Monitor I/O.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Ambisone may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   Improved with irrigation.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo SCT) and is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pulmonary infiltrates, bradycardia, altered mental status, facial twitching, elevated ammonia levels, elevated beta-glucan, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fluid overload, hematuria, and atrial fibrillation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are any issues with the mechanical ventilation or if there is a development of new complications such as pneumonia or worsening pulmonary infiltrates.

2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia but may still be at risk for developing new infections or worsening of existing pulmonary infiltrates. Monitoring and appropriate antimicrobial therapy will be crucial.

3. Bradycardia: The cause of bradycardia needs to be monitored, and any vagal etiology should be addressed. If the bradycardia persists or recurs, further evaluation and management may be required.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, pulmonary infiltrates, bradycardia, altered mental status, facial twitching, elevated ammonia levels, elevated beta-glucan levels, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fluid overload, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and may require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia but may still require monitoring and discontinuation of select antimicrobials.
3. PEA Arrest: The patient experienced repeated episodes of PEA arrest, which improved but the underlying cause is unclear. Monitoring the patient's heart rate is important.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is attributed to medications, viremia, and possible hepatic encephalopathy. Further evaluation of neurological status is necessary, including an EEG and head MRI.
5. Elevated Ammonia Levels: The patient has elevated ammonia levels, which may be related to hepatic dysfunction or gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring NH3 levels and evaluating for GI bleed is crucial.

   - Neurology again strongly argued against EEG (they believe the patient
   made purposeful movements to grab his tube when off Propofol, had all
   brain stem reflexes, except for gag).  Said will show nothing but slow
   brain waves on Propofol. Recommended MRI to look for evidence of anoxic
   brain injury vs. evidence of infection vs. white matter changed

","Summary:
- Patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of CLL and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma post allo SCT.
- He presented to the MICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest due to PE and had apical infiltrates on CXR, suggesting possible aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and intubated.
- He has been diagnosed with BK viremia, AMS, hypothermia, and pancytopenia.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.4°C (95.8°F), blood pressure of 104/67 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- The patient has melena, hematuria, and an expanding subdural hygroma on MRI.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of sepsis due to hypotension and positive fluid balance, which may require aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The presence of apical infiltrates on CXR raises concerns for aspiration pneumonia, which can complicate the patient's respiratory status.
3. Pancytopen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (allo SCT) 2-24 weeks ago and experienced acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and hypothermia in the setting of BK virusemia. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [9-10]. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension/sepsis, altered mental status, pancytopenia, CLL with bone marrow transplantation complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), melena, and hematuria. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient is experiencing hypotension requiring increasing amounts of fluids to keep blood pressures up. This may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's MRI shows stable subdural hematomas with no acute infarcts, but there is a question of expanding subdural hygromas. An EEG has been ordered to rule out status epilepticus, and a neurosurgery consult is being sought for the possibility of expanding frontal hygromas.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   1. Hypotension/sepsis: He continues to require increasing amounts of
   fluids to keep BPs up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.
   He is DNR and off pressors.  On stress dose-steroids.  Will continue
   treatment with Abx.
   -Continue methylprednisolone
   -LR boluses as needed to keep MAP>60 / SBP>90 (use LR given decreased
   bicarb& hyper-Cl and decreased anion gap).
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem given continued
   hypothermia, hypotension.
   -Continue treatment for Toxoplasmosis with Pyrimethium, Leucovorin,
   Clindamycin.
   -F/u ID recs, BMT recs.
   -Continue Haldol dose to 1mg q6hours and start low dose Zydis in order
   to attempt to wean off Propofol given hypotension
   -F/u pending microbiologic studies
   - IP c/s to evaluate patient for possible trach placement (likely not
   rec
d as pt high risk but needs eval)
   .
   2. Altered mental status: MRI shows stable subdurals with no acute
   infarcts. There was a question of expanding subdural hygromas. EEG
   showed no seizure like activity, just diffuse global encephalopathy.
   Neuro has signed off. Neurosurgery does not recommend any surgical
   intervention as patient has high operative risk (and is DNR).
   .
   3. Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50.
   -Continue to trend Hct and Plt closely and transfuse for above goals
   .
   4. CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate BMT recs
   5. [**Date Range **]
 Now with new [**Date Range 7452**].  Has had GVHD and stress ulcer in
   past, consult GI for possible EGD.
   - Trend Hct Q8H
   - Transfuse pRBCs for Hct < 25
   - HCT responded appropriately after xfusion 1u PRBC.
   6. Hematuria
 Etiology is BK cystitis vs. secondary to Ambisome vs
   thrombocytopenia .  Improved with irrigation, but continues to be
   hematuric
   - continue CBI.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: hold tube fees in the setting of [**Last Name (LF) 7452**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need access
   for PPN vs TPN?

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   # Hypotension/sepsis: Pt. requiring increasing amounts of fluids to
   keep BPs up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.  He is DNR
   and off pressors.  On stress dose-steroids.  Will continue treatment
   with Abx.
   -Continue methylprednisolone
   -LR boluses as needed to keep MAP>60 / SBP>90 (use LR given decreased
   bicarb and hyperchloremia and decreased anion gap).
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem given continued
   hypothermia, hypotension.
   -Continue treatment for Toxoplasmosis with Pyrimethium, Leucovorin,
   Clindamycin.
   -F/u ID recs, BMT recs.
   -Continue Haldol dose to 1mg q6hours and start low dose Zydis in order
   to attempt to wean off Propofol given hypotension
   -F/u pending microbiologic studies
   .
   # Altered mental status: MRI shows stable subdurals with no acute
   infarcts. There was a question of expanding subdural hygromas.
   -EEG to r/u status epilepticus
   -f/u neuro recs
   -neurosurgery consult for ? of expanding frontal hygromas
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50.
   -Continue to trend Hct and Plt closely and transfuse for above goals
   .
   # CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate BMT recs
   #  Melena
 Now with new melena.  Has had GVHD and stress ulcer in
   past.
   - Trend Hct Q8H
   - Transfuse pRBCs for Hct < 25
   # Hematuria
 Etiology is BK cystitis vs. secondary to Ambisome vs
   thrombocytopenia .  Improved with irrigation, but continues to be
   hematuric
   - continue CBI.

   discussion with HCP
   Dispo : To ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation into aggressive large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo SCT) and is currently experiencing multiple complications.

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient requires increasing amounts of fluids to maintain blood pressure, indicating potential hypotension and sepsis. He is also experiencing positive fluid balance. This may be due to infection or septic shock.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's MRI shows stable subdural hematomas with no acute infarcts. There is a concern for expanding subdural hygromas. An EEG has been ordered to rule out status epilepticus.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient likely has pancytopenia due to immunosuppression, infection, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The hematocrit (Hct) goal is >25, and the platelet (plt) goal is >50. Close monitoring of Hct and plt levels with transfusion for above goals is recommended.

4. CLL with BMT c/b GVHD: The patient continues to receive immunosuppressants and prophylactic regimens. BMT recommendations should be appreciated.

5. Melena: The patient has new melena, which could be related to past GVHD and stress"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Reintubated in context of PEA arrest.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Suspect poor candidate to work
   towards repeat extubation trial in setting of markedly abnormal mental
   status.  Would assess for tracheostomy, and discuss options with wife.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   Would encourage discontinue select antimicrobials.
   PEA ARREST -- Repeated.  Unclear precipitant, although concern remains
   aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No
   further episodes.
   BRADYCARDIA
 Possible vagal etiology.  Monitor HR.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Attributed to medications, viremia, possible
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of SDH --> no evidence for
   progression of SDH.   Current head MRI demonstrates bilateral frontal
   hygromas, perhaps expanding --> Limit psychotropic meds if possible.
   Unclear whether SDH drainage viable option (in context of severe
   thrombocytopenia).  Monitor.  Elevated NH3.  Consider EEG (assess for
   status epilepticus) and head MRI (assess for anoxic brain injury) to
   further evaluate neurological status.  Neurosurgical consultation RE:
   management of SDH and expanding hygroma.
   FACIAL TWITCHING -- Transient, and resolved.  Unclear etiology, but
   concerns include toxic-metabolic derrangement, or seizure.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   attributed to Propofol.  Await EEG.
    ELEVATED NH3
 desire to treat with lactulose, but hold while
   evaluating for GI bleed.  Monitor NH3, LFTs.
   ELEVATED b-GLUCAN -- concern for ongoing fungal infection.  Continue
   antifungals.  Await g-glactomannan.
   GI BLEED -- Recurrent problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding,
   but at risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and
   on steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to
   fall, consider GI consultation.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   FLUIDS -- total body volume hyperexpanded, but intravascular marginal.
   Desure net negative fluid balance.  Monitor I/O.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Ambisone may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   Improved with irrigation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds.  Monitor BP.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 desire resuming TF via OGT.  Consider PEG if
   trach is placed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) and is now in the ICU following a cardiac arrest. The patient has been reintubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about his mental status, which may be attributed to medications, viremia, or possible hepatic encephalopathy. The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates and a history of aspiration pneumonia. He experienced a second episode of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, but improved without further episodes. Other notable findings include bradycardia, facial twitching, elevated ammonia levels, elevated b-glucan, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fluid overload, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to the ongoing mechanical ventilation and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or extubation failure.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may continue to deteriorate, potentially leading to delirium or coma. Further evaluation of his neurological status through EEG and head MRI is recommended.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding may require GI consultation and intervention to identify and manage the underlying cause.
4. Anemia and Throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Reintubated in context of PEA arrest.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Suspect poor candidate to work
   towards repeat extubation trial in setting of markedly abnormal mental
   status.  Would assess for tracheostomy, and discuss options with wife.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   Would encourage discontinue select antimicrobials.
   PEA ARREST -- Repeated.  Unclear precipitant, although concern remains
   aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No
   further episodes.
   BRADYCARDIA
 Possible vagal etiology.  Monitor HR.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Attributed to medications, viremia, possible
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of SDH --> no evidence for
   progression of SDH.   Current head MRI demonstrates bilateral frontal
   hygromas, perhaps expanding --> Limit psychotropic meds if possible.
   Unclear whether SDH drainage viable option (in context of severe
   thrombocytopenia).  Monitor.  Elevated NH3.  Consider EEG (assess for
   status epilepticus) and head MRI (assess for anoxic brain injury) to
   further evaluate neurological status.  Neurosurgical consultation
   intervention at this time.
   FACIAL TWITCHING -- Transient, and resolved.  Unclear etiology, but
   concerns include toxic-metabolic derrangement, or seizure.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   attributed to Propofol.  EEG without evidence for seizure focus.
    ELEVATED NH3
 desire to treat with lactulose, but hold while
   evaluating for GI bleed.  Monitor NH3, LFTs.
   ELEVATED b-GLUCAN -- concern for ongoing fungal infection.  Continue
   antifungals.  Await g-glactomannan.
   GI BLEED -- Recurrent problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding,
   but at risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and
   on steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to
   fall, consider GI consultation.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   FLUIDS -- total body volume hyperexpanded, but intravascular marginal.
   Desure net negative fluid balance.  Monitor I/O.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Ambisone may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   Improved with irrigation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds.  Monitor BP.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 desire resuming TF via OGT.  Consider PEG if
   trach is placed.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   Telephone conversation with wife.  Updated medical condition, answered
   all questions.  Recurrent GI bleed, with no plans for GI endoscopy.  No
   plans for Neurosurgical intervention.  Unable to provide nutrition via
   GI tract during active GI bleed.  Insufficient central access for
   TPN.   Wife understands current state, and desire to determine
   direction of care.  In the absence of obvious improvement in mental
   status, and the failed extubation attempt last week, at this time
   decision is to either proceed to tracheotomy tube (will require
   surgical placement) and PEG if patient would accept longterm mechanical
   ventilation, or to change focus of care to comfort.  Wife will consider
   options over weekend and will meet to discuss final decision on
   Monday.  Plan to consult Thoracic Surgery over weekend to assess for
   trach/PEG, as wife would like to speak to surgeon prior to making final
   decision.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL who underwent allo-SCT and is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been reintubated due to a PEA arrest and is on mechanical ventilation. There are several potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates and was treated for aspiration pneumonia. It is important to monitor for signs of infection or worsening pneumonia.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient has recurrent melena, which indicates ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to various causes such as peptic ulcer disease, GVHD, or other gastrointestinal pathology. Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin concentration and considering GI consultation if the bleeding continues is recommended.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can be attributed to immunosuppression, infection, or GVHD. Transfusion of platelets should be considered when the platelet count is below 50,000.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to blood loss and immunosuppression. Monitoring the hemoglobin concentration and transfusing blood products if the hemoglobin falls below 25 g/dL is advised.

5. Fluid Balance: The patient's total body volume is hyperexpanded, but intravascularly, he is marginally negative for fluids. It is crucial to monitor the patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yom CLL (large cell transformation) --> s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**], now
   returns to MICU following PEA arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Reintubated in context of PEA arrest.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation.  Suspect poor candidate to work
   towards repeat extubation trial in setting of markedly abnormal mental
   status.  Would assess for tracheostomy, and discuss options with wife.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
   Would encourage discontinue select antimicrobials.
   PEA ARREST -- Repeated.  Unclear precipitant, although concern remains
   aspiration with hypoxemia, acidosis, hypovolemia.  Improved.  No
   further episodes.
   BRADYCARDIA
 Possible vagal etiology.  Monitor HR.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Attributed to medications, viremia, possible
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Likely contribution of SDH --> no evidence for
   progression of SDH.   Current head MRI demonstrates bilateral frontal
   hygromas, perhaps expanding --> Limit psychotropic meds if possible.
   Unclear whether SDH drainage viable option (in context of severe
   thrombocytopenia).  Monitor.  Elevated NH3.  Consider EEG (assess for
   status epilepticus) and head MRI (assess for anoxic brain injury) to
   further evaluate neurological status.  Neurosurgical consultation
   intervention at this time.
   FACIAL TWITCHING -- Transient, and resolved.  Unclear etiology, but
   concerns include toxic-metabolic derrangement, or seizure.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   attributed to Propofol.  EEG without evidence for seizure focus.
    ELEVATED NH3
 desire to treat with lactulose, but hold while
   evaluating for GI bleed.  Monitor NH3, LFTs.
   ELEVATED b-GLUCAN -- concern for ongoing fungal infection.  Continue
   antifungals.  Await g-glactomannan.
   GI BLEED -- Recurrent problem, may represent passing of oral bleeding,
   but at risk for PUD, GVHD, or other Gi pathology (at risk while NPO and
   on steroids).  Monitor.  If melena continues, and Hct continues to
   fall, consider GI consultation.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to immunosuppression, and recent blood loss.
   Monitor Hct, transfuse <25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   Will transfuse for plts <50.
   FLUIDS -- total body volume hyperexpanded, but intravascular marginal.
   Desure net negative fluid balance.  Monitor I/O.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed to foley catheter trauma in setting of
   thrombocytopenia.  Ambisone may precipitate cystitis and bleeding.
   Improved with irrigation.
   A-FIB -- now back in NSR, off amioderone.  Monitor HR.
   CLL --> s/p BMTx, c/b GVHD:   Continue immunosuppressant and
   prophylactic regimens.  Continue cidofovir.
   HTN -- hold anti-HTN meds.  Monitor BP.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 desire resuming TF via OGT.  Consider PEG if
   trach is placed.

   1. Hypotension: He continues to require increasing amounts of fluids to
   keep BPs up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.  He is DNR
   and off pressors.  DDx includes distributive (eg. septic) shock vs.
   hypovolemic shock ([**12-20**] bleeding).  On stress-dosed steroids
   -Give fluids and PRBCs as needed to maintain MAP>60/SBP>90, Hct>25.
   -Continue methylprednisolone
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem
   -Continue treatment for Toxoplasmosis with Pyrimethium, Leucovorin,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with a history of CLL and transformation into aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent an allo SCT (allogeneic stem cell transplantation) 2-24 weeks ago. The patient experienced AMS (acute myocardial stunning) and hypothermia in the setting of BK viremia and was subsequently transferred to the MICU after a PEA (pulseless electrical activity) arrest on [9-10]. The patient also has apical infiltrates on CXR, raising concerns for possible aspiration pneumonia and pancytopenia.

The patient's current medical complications include hypotension, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, CLL with BMT complicated by GVHD (graft-versus-host disease), and hematuria. 

1. Hypotension: The patient requires increasing amounts of fluids to maintain blood pressure, resulting in a significantly positive fluid balance. The differential diagnosis includes distributive (e.g., septic) shock versus hypovolemic shock due to bleeding. The patient is on stress-dosed steroids and is DNR (do not resuscitate). The plan includes giving fluids and PRBCs (packed red blood cells) as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) >90, and to maintain hematocrit (Hct) >25.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old gentleman with CLL and [**Doctor Last Name **]
s transformation (aggressive
   large B-cell lymphoma)  s/p allo SCT in [**2-24**] w/ AMS and hypothermia in
   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   1. Hypotension/sepsis: He continues to require increasing amounts of
   fluids to keep BPs up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.
   He is DNR and off pressors.  On stress dose-steroids.  Will continue
   treatment with Abx.
   -Continue methylprednisolone
   -LR boluses as needed to keep MAP>60 / SBP>90 (use LR given decreased
   bicarb& hyper-Cl and decreased anion gap).
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem given continued
   hypothermia, hypotension.
   -Continue treatment for Toxoplasmosis with Pyrimethium, Leucovorin,
   Clindamycin.
   -F/u ID recs, BMT recs.
   -Continue Haldol dose to 1mg q6hours and start low dose Zydis in order
   to attempt to wean off Propofol given hypotension
   -F/u pending microbiologic studies
   - IP c/s to evaluate patient for possible trach placement (likely not
   rec
d as pt high risk but needs eval)
   .
   2. Altered mental status: MRI shows stable subdurals with no acute
   infarcts. There was a question of expanding subdural hygromas. EEG
   showed no seizure like activity, just diffuse global encephalopathy.
   Neuro has signed off. Neurosurgery does not recommend any surgical
   intervention as patient has high operative risk (and is DNR).
   .
   3. Pancytopenia: Most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD.
   HCT goal >25, plt goal > 50.
   -Continue to trend Hct and Plt closely and transfuse for above goals
   .
   4. CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate BMT recs
   5. [**Date Range **]
 Now with new [**Date Range 7452**].  Has had GVHD and stress ulcer in
   past, consult GI for possible EGD.
   - Trend Hct Q8H
   - Transfuse pRBCs for Hct < 25
   - HCT responded appropriately after xfusion 1u PRBC.
   6. Hematuria
 Etiology is BK cystitis vs. secondary to Ambisome vs
   thrombocytopenia .  Improved with irrigation, but continues to be
   hematuric
   - continue CBI.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: hold tube fees in the setting of [**Last Name (LF) 7452**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need access
   for PPN vs TPN?

   Dispo : To ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CLL and transformation to aggressive large B-cell lymphoma post-allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT). He presented to the MICU after experiencing pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was found to have apical infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating possible aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension/sepsis, altered mental status, pancytopenia, and complications related to CLL and bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He is on stress dose-steroids and various antibiotics due to infection concerns.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient continues to require increasing amounts of fluids to maintain blood pressure, resulting in a significantly positive fluid balance. He is at risk for developing further hypotension and sepsis if his fluid management is not optimized.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to the combination of hypothermia, hypotension, and potential brain involvement from the aggressive lymphoma. This puts him at risk for further neurological deterioration.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is most likely due to immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. Close monitoring of his complete blood count (CBC) is crucial to guide transfusion decisions and prevent bleeding or infection complications.

   I saw and examined the patient with the medical housestaff and ICU
   fellow on am rounds, assessment and plan was discussed in detail. As
   noted above, per the wife
s wishes as the HCP, the goals of care were
   changed to comfort measures.  Agree with starting morphine drip, once
   started can start to decrease propofol.  Wife is concerned about his
   comfort and feels propofol makes him most comfortable but has been
   reassured of effectiveness of morphine in this setting, particularly
   for any pain or respiratory distress he may be experiencing.  Agree
   with plan as otherwise detailed above.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) two years ago. He presented with AMS and hypothermia in the setting of BK viremia, and was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [9-10]. The patient also had apical infiltrates on CXR, which raised concerns for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and pancytopenia.

The family decided against further escalation of care, including no antimicrobials, no blood transfusions, laboratory or imaging studies. Instead, the patient would receive comfort care with pain control and sedation. The patient remains intubated on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mmHg and a heart rate (HR) of 88 beats per minute. His respiratory rate (RR) is set at 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%.

   the setting of  BK viremia, transferred to MICU after PEA arrest on
   [**9-10**],  with apical infiltrates on CXR (as of [**9-11**]) concerning for
   possible aspiration PNA and pancytopenia.
   1. Hypotension: He continues to require increasing amounts of fluids to
   keep BPs up, resulting in a significantly positive balance.  He is DNR
   and off pressors.  DDx includes distributive (eg. septic) shock vs.
   hypovolemic shock ([**12-20**] bleeding).  On stress-dosed steroids
   -Give fluids and PRBCs as needed to maintain MAP>60/SBP>90, Hct>25.
   -Continue methylprednisolone
   -Continue Ambisome, Linezolid and Meropenem
   -Continue treatment for Toxoplasmosis with Pyrimethium, Leucovorin,
   Clindamycin.
   -F/u ID recs, BMT recs
   -F/u pending microbiologic studies
   .
   2. Altered mental status: MRI shows stable subdurals with no acute
   infarcts. There was a question of expanding subdural hygromas. EEG
   showed no seizure like activity, just diffuse global encephalopathy.
   Neuro has signed off. Neurosurgery does not recommend any surgical
   intervention as patient has high operative risk (and is DNR).
   -Restarted propofol to make patient more comfortable.
   -Consider d/c
ing Haldol now that patient is back on propofol
   .
   3. Anemia: Hct downtrending, concerning to bleeding (patient likely has
   both GI and GU bleeding).
   -transfuse 1 units PRBCs (goal >25)
   -trend Hct
   .
   4. Thrombocytopenia: Most likely due to
   immunosuppression/infection/GVHD. Plt goal > 50.
   -transfuse 1 bag of plateletes this a.m., continue to trend Plt count
   .
   5. CLL with BMT c/b GVHD:
   - Continue immunosuppressant and prophylactic regimens
   - appreciate BMT recs
   6. [**Month/Day (2) **]
 Now with [**Month/Day (2) 7452**].  Has had GVHD and stress ulcer in past.
   - Trend Hct
   - f/u GI recs
   - Transfuse pRBCs for Hct < 25
   7. Hematuria
 Etiology is BK cystitis vs. secondary to Ambisome.
   - continue CBI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and transformation into aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) 2 years ago. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to a previous cardiac arrest and concerns of aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient has pancytopenia and is experiencing hypotension, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible BK virus-related cystitis. He is DNR and on stress-dosed steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires increasing amounts of fluids to maintain blood pressure. Possible causes include septic shock or hypovolemic shock. Treatment includes fluid resuscitation, packed red blood cell transfusions, and stress-dosed steroids.
2. Altered mental status: The patient has a history of subdural hygromas, and an EEG shows diffuse global encephalopathy. Neurology has signed off, and neurosurgery does not recommend any surgical intervention due to the patient's high operative risk.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is trending down, indicating possible ongoing bleeding. Transfusion of packed red blood cells is recommended to maintain a target Hct of >25.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count likely due to immunosuppression,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and aggressive large B-cell lymphoma. He underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo SCT) but developed acute myelosuppression (AMS) and hypothermia. The patient also has BK virus-associated nephropathy (BK viremia).

The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [9-10]. A chest X-ray showed apical infiltrates, raising concerns for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA). Additionally, the patient has pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).

The family decided to forgo further escalation of care, including withholding antimicrobials, blood transfusions, laboratory or imaging studies. The patient will receive comfort care with pain control using fentanyl and morphine, sedation with propofol, and continued mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is already experiencing hypotension, which may require IV fluids as needed for hemodynamic stability.

2. Infection: Despite the lack of antimicrobial treatment, the patient remains at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient"

He presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest (PEA) on 9-10, with apical infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR) concerning for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and pancytopenia.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status even when sedation is weaned, persistent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoxemia. His laboratory values indicate elevated lactate levels, low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has been on multiple medications including antibiotics (Linezolid, Ambisome, Clindamycin, Meropenem), sedatives (Propofol, Midazolam), and pain management medications (Fentanyl, Morphine).

The patient's family has decided to pursue comfort measures only, which means no further blood products or IV fluids, no laboratory or imaging studies, and allowing the patient to pass away naturally. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 52/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100"
