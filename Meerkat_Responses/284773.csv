   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7056**] is a 68 year old gentleman with DM 2, seizure disorder, dCHF,
   HTN, and neuropathy discharged yesterday after completing an 11 day
   course of vancomycin for a LLL MRSA pneumonia admitted for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology at this time. The patient recently
   completed an 11 day course of vancomycin for possible MRSA pneumonia at
   LLL that radiographically resolved prior to discharge.  He has been
   afebrile wtihout a leukocytosis, although he does report increased
   cough without sputum production.  The patient also has a history of
   diabetic neuropathy as well as orthostasis, and his intermitent
   hypotension without a clear source may suggest autonomic instability.
   Finally, the patient was unclear as to his metoprolol dosing, and may
   have taken excessive anti-hypertensives. The hypotension resolved upon
   coming to the floor. In the ED the pt received IVF and pressors.
   - Levophed was weaned after 35 minutes on the floor. Restart to goal
   MAP > 60, UOP >30cc if needed
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Follow up UA, culture and blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue meropenem and vancomycin until culture results
   - Check TSH, B12, folate, SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # SOB: Most likeley etiology at this time is inadequately treated left
   lower lobe consolidation.
   - Vancomycin and meropenem. Will likely be able to discontinue
   meropenem after cultures are negative.
   - Check sputum as above.
   .
   # ARF: Unclear etiology at this time given that creatinine was 1.1
   yesterday. The patient present with Cr from 3.2 to 1.3. Positive rare
   Eos. Less likely AIN.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Consider nephrology consult for abnormal presentation
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Trending down after IVF, likely secondary to
   intravascular volume depletion and poor forward flow.
   - Trend lactate
   .
   # Dizziness: Unclear etiology at this time, although patient has
   baseline multifactorial ataxia per neurology notes.  Symptoms currently
   resolved. Low suspicion for CVA at this time.
   - Repeat neuro exam when hypotension resolved.
   .
   # CV: Patient with diastolic CHF with LVEF 55-60% on [**2132-8-3**].  Of note,
   the patient has baseline chronic chest pain.
   - Hold beta blockade due to hypotension
   - Resume once pressures tolerate
   - Monitor fluid status closely
   .
   # Acetaminophen: Elevated acetaminophen level in setting of prescribed
   percocet use.  Patient states that he takes no more percocet than
   prescribed.
   - Trend LFTs, hold off on NAC for now.
   .
   # Seizure: Unlikely to be aura, seisure or post-ictal state given
   history.
   - Continue keppra
   .
   # DM 2:
   - ISS and accuchecks
   .
   # GERD: Continue PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient has a history of diabetic neuropathy and orthostasis, which may contribute to intermittent hypotension. The hypotension has resolved upon coming to the floor, but it is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust treatment accordingly.

2. SOB (Shortness of breath): The most likely etiology at this time is inadequately treated left lower lobe consolidation. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and meropenem. It is recommended to continue these medications and check sputum cultures as well.

3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's creatinine level has improved from 3.2 to 1.3, which is positive. However, the cause of ARF is unclear. It is advised to trend BUN/Cr, avoid nephrotoxins, and consider a nephrology consult if necessary.

4. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are trending down after IVF (intravenous fluids), likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion and poor forward flow. It is important to continue monitoring lactate levels.

5. Dizziness: The etiology of the patient's dizziness is unclear, although it may be related to baseline multifactorial ataxia per neurology notes. Symptoms have currently resolved, and low suspicion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-inch-old individual with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 135/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has a CVP of 6 mmHg. The patient has received multiple infusions of medications including heparin sodium, vancomycin, and meropenem. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, and troponin T, but elevated levels of glucose and other lab markers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's main concern is hypotension, which can be caused by various factors such as septic shock, hemorrhage, or heart failure. It is crucial to identify and treat the underlying cause promptly.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient may also have hypovolemia due to fluid depletion, leading to decreased blood volume and further contributing to hypotension. Close monitoring of fluid balance and appropriate fluid resuscitation might be necessary.
3. Infection: The patient has received multiple cultures and antibiotics, indicating a potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for hypotension and hypovolemia without shock. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, erythromycin base, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 08/16/2132 at 03:30 PM and meropenem on 08/17/2132 at 04:08 AM. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels may indicate sepsis, especially considering the recent blood cultures and urine culture taken on 08/16/2132.
2. Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels (2.0) and decreased urine output may suggest acute kidney injury.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels and slightly elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) may indicate liver dysfunction.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's use of respiratory support and ABG results may indicate underlying respiratory complications such"

 CHRONIC PAIN
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7056**] is a 68 year old gentleman with DM 2, seizure disorder, dCHF,
   HTN, and neuropathy discharged yesterday after completing an 11 day
   course of vancomycin for a LLL MRSA pneumonia admitted for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology at this time. The patient recently
   completed an 11 day course of vancomycin for possible MRSA pneumonia at
   LLL that radiographically resolved prior to discharge.  He has been
   afebrile wtihout a leukocytosis, although he does report increased
   cough without sputum production.  The patient also has a history of
   diabetic neuropathy as well as orthostasis, and his intermitent
   hypotension without a clear source may suggest autonomic instability.
   Finally, the patient was unclear as to his metoprolol dosing, and may
   have taken excessive anti-hypertensives. The hypotension resolved upon
   coming to the floor. In the ED the pt received IVF and pressors.
   BP
s normo- to hypertensive, plan to restart anti-hypertensives
   - Follow up UA, culture and blood
   - Continue meropenem and vancomycin until culture results
   - Check TSH, B12, folate, SPEP/UPEP
   - induce sputum cultures
   - case worker
 to determine if pt can get linezolid covered
   .
   # SOB: Most likeley etiology at this time is inadequately treated left
   lower lobe consolidation.
   - Vancomycin and meropenem. Will likely be able to discontinue
   meropenem after cultures are negative.
   - Check sputum as above.
   .
   # ARF: Unclear etiology at this time given that creatinine was 1.1
   yesterday. The patient present with Cr from 3.2 to 1.3. Positive rare
   Eos. Less likely AIN.
   - creatinine continues to improve.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Trending down after IVF, likely secondary to
   intravascular volume depletion and poor forward flow.
   - Trend lactate
   .
   # Dizziness: Unclear etiology at this time, although patient has
   baseline multifactorial ataxia per neurology notes.  Symptoms currently
   resolved. Low suspicion for CVA at this time.
   .
   # CV: Patient with diastolic CHF with LVEF 55-60% on [**2132-8-3**].  Of note,
   the patient has baseline chronic chest pain.
   - Had been holding beta blockade due to hypotension
   - Resume once pressures tolerate
   - Monitor fluid status closely
   .
   # Acetaminophen: Elevated acetaminophen level in setting of prescribed
   percocet use.  Patient states that he takes no more percocet than
   prescribed.
   - Trend LFTs, hold off on NAC for now.
   .
   # Seizure: Unlikely to be aura, seisure or post-ictal state given
   history.
   - Continue keppra
 adjust for renal function
   .
   # DM 2:
   - ISS and accuchecks
   .
   # GERD: Continue PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, seizure disorder, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and neuropathy. He was discharged yesterday after completing an 11-day course of vancomycin for a left lower lobe MRSA pneumonia. The patient presented with hypotension and is currently in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure of 160/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is cooperative but mildly agitated and has limited pulmonary exam due to minimal inspiratory effort. Physical examination findings also include crackles at the right base, regular rhythm without murmurs, and soft abdomen. Neurologic examination is not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's medical complications include ineffective coping, adrenal insufficiency, hypotension, hypovolemia, chronic pain, and possible inadequately treated left lower lobe consolidation. The plan includes restarting anti-hypertensives, checking TSH, B12, folate, SPEP/UPEP, inducing sputum cultures, and considering linezolid coverage."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, seizure disorder, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and neuropathy. He was recently discharged after completing an 11-day course of vancomycin for possible MRSA pneumonia at the left lower lobe, which has since resolved. The patient presented with hypotension, which resolved upon coming to the floor. He received IV fluids and pressors in the emergency department. His blood pressure is now normotensive to hypertensive, and anti-hypertensives will be restarted.

The patient also reports increased cough without sputum production and has a history of diabetic neuropathy as well as orthostasis. His intermittent hypotension without a clear source may suggest autonomic instability. The patient was unclear about his metoprolol dosing and may have taken excessive anti-hypertensives.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure of 160/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. He is alert and oriented, but anxious.

Physical examination findings include mild crackles at the right lung base, regular rhythm with no murmurs, and soft abdomen. Neurological examination is limited due to minimal inspiratory effort.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood"

   Finally, the patient was unclear as to his metoprolol dosing, and may
   have taken excessive anti-hypertensives. The hypotension resolved upon
   coming to the floor. In the ED the pt received IVF and pressors.
   - Levophed was weaned after 35 minutes on the floor. Restart to goal
   MAP > 60, UOP >30cc if needed
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Follow up UA, culture and blood
   - Continue meropenem and vancomycin until culture results
   - Check TSH, B12, folate, SPEP/UPEP
   - induce sputum cultures
   - case worker

   # SOB: Most likeley etiology at this time is inadequately treated left
   lower lobe consolidation.
   - Vancomycin and meropenem. Will likely be able to discontinue
   meropenem after cultures are negative.
   - Check sputum as above.

   - Trend BUN/Cr - now improving.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins

   # Lactic acidosis: Trending down after IVF, likely secondary to
   intravascular volume depletion and poor forward flow.
   - Trend lactate

   # Dizziness: Unclear etiology at this time, although patient has
   baseline multifactorial ataxia per neurology notes.  Symptoms currently
   resolved. Low suspicion for CVA at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with hypotension and had a history of allergies to certain medications. They were given antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem) but experienced low oxygen saturation levels. The patient's vital signs were monitored, showing sinus bradycardia, fluctuating blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's fluid balance showed a negative balance of 2,271 mL. They were on prophylactic heparin sodium and received ICU medications. The patient's review of systems revealed dyspnea.

The patient's physical examination showed alertness, clear HEENT, diminished breath sounds on the left base with right-sided crackles, soft abdomen, trace edema, and intact neurologic function. Lab results indicated elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's creatinine levels improved from 2.0 to 1.1 over the course of three days.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Ineffective coping
2. Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)
3. Hypotension (resolved)
4. Hypovolemia (volume depletion without shock)
5. Chronic pain
6. MRSA pneumonia
7. Acute renal failure (resolved)
8. Long-term narcotics use

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 HYPOVOLEMIA (VOLUME DEPLETION - WITHOUT SHOCK)
 CHRONIC PAIN
   Hypotension: resolved, again interesting scenario with transient but
   profound hypotension that resolves with ++IVF and transient pressors.
   In terms of sepsis- fluids and restart ABX could be an explanation for
   turn around  but we are also interested in investigating adrenals and
   autonomic instability. Random cortisol 1.5 but did stim to 23. will add
   cortisol onto admit labs
   MRSA PNA: ID consulted and felt we can hold on ABX and watch, repeat
   sputum cx, repeat CT to look at LLL. If fails to clear may need bronch
   at some point to exclude endobronchial lesion, foreign body.
