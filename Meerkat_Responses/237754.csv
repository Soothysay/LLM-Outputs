","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of T2 paraplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pneumonia. She presents with sepsis and is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of infection in her urine analysis. There is also a possibility of pneumonia, as indicated by a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and productive cough with brown sputum. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on 50% FiO2, and her ABG results show a slightly elevated pH and PaCO2. Her blood glucose level is elevated at 145 mg/dL. The patient's hemodynamic parameters are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/58 to 112/64 mmHg, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin), norepinephrine for hemodynamic support, fentanyl and midazolam for sedation, and other ICU medications. She has a Foley catheter in place and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly and effectively"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of T2 paraplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pneumonia. She presented with sepsis and was intubated. The source of sepsis is unclear, but it may be due to urosepsis or pneumonia. The patient's sputum shows 4+ GNR (Gram-negative rods), and her urine analysis is positive for infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and azithromycin for atypical coverage. The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. She also has hypoxia, which could be due to sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or recurrent right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 104/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is receiving invasive ventilation and multi-lumen catheterization. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and electrolyte imbalances. Radiographs reveal a moderate right effusion and bilateral alveolar infiltrates, which are more confluent and dense on today's study, especially in the left mid lung. The assessment"

   the infiltrate also looks slightly worse on the right.
   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and recurrent UTIs and
   pneumonia presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis: The patient does not have a clear source for her sepsis.  It
   is possible she has urosepsis given positive U/A.  Blood cultures
   pending.  Alternative source is a possible pneumonia, given RLL
   infiltrate on CXR and 4+ GNR on sputum culture.  However this is
   unchanged from previous films and likely a chronic change.  She may
   have a reduced ability to clear secretions secondary to her T2
   paraplegia and decreased ability to utilize abdominal muscles.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of T2 paraplegia, recurrent UTIs, and pneumonia who presents with sepsis. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The initial assessment suggests that the patient may have urosepsis due to the positive urinalysis findings or possibly pneumonia given the right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray and the presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum culture.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated and on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient's current symptoms, such as cough productive of brown sputum and worsening lung infiltrates, may indicate VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility due to paraplegia is a risk factor for DVT and subsequent PE. Although the patient's physical examination does not show signs consistent with PE, it is still a potential complication to consider.

3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospitalization and the use of invasive lines and devices increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and catheter-related urinary tract infections (CAUTIs).

4. Hypotension and shock: The patient's initial presentation with seps"

   Critical Care Attending Addendum
   I was present with the ICU team for the key portions of the services
   this AM and I agree with the detailed note above. I would add emphasize
   the following:
   50 yo woman w/ MVA/spinal artery thrombus resulting in T2 quadriplegia
   '[**42**] with intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to either UTI
   or pneumonia now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with hypotension and acute
   respiratory failure. Was brought to ED by husband tonight after acute
   decompensation with facial redness and coughing with low O2 sats in 80s
   despite supplemental O2. Progressive respiratory distress and
   hypotension in [**Hospital1 5**] ED requiring intubation with CXR showing ?RLL
   infiltrate. Started on vanco/zosyn/azithromycin, 5 L IVF, and central
   line place in ED. Initial UA+.
   Overnight in ICU, aline placed, weaned down on levophed, Tm 100.2,
   78-127, SBP 104-112 on levo, RR22-28 CVP3-10, 380x28/PEEP 10, Fio2 .5
   7.42/34/89, On exam intubated, sedated, opening eyes to voice, old
   trach scar, decreased coarse breath sounds bilaterally. Distant regular
   HS w/o murmur, abd obese, nondistended, few bowel sounds, minimal trace
   edema of LE. WBC 7.8, HCT 32.7, K2.9, Cr 0.2, Lact 1.4. UA 21-50WBC,
   mod bact, sputum gs w/gnr and yeast, cx pend. CXR's showing ETT/OG/R IJ
   in place w/?R basilar infiltrate vs mild volume overload (although not
   significantly different than prior).
   In summary, complex 50 yo woman with history of prior episodes of
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia and/or urinary tract
   infection on background of T2 paraplegia and perhaps reduced ability to
   clear secretions. We will cover broadly with vanco/zosyn/azithromyic
   pending urine/blood/sputum cultures. Given UA we are concerned for
   urinary source although history is also suggestive of mucus plugging
   and reduced sputum clearance. Full mechanical ventilatory support
   requiring sedation and IV pressors. Will attempt to wean vent and
   pressors now that she has been fully fluid resuscitated for septic
   picture. ICU prophylaxis with boots/PPI - continue discussions with
   husband. Full code.

   # Sepsis: The patient does not have a clear source for her sepsis.  It
   is possible she has urosepsis given positive U/A.  Blood cultures
   pending.  Alternative source is a possible pneumonia, given history of
   mucous plugging, possible reduced ability to clear secretions secondary
   to her paraplegia.  Also, RLL infiltrate on CXR and 4+ GNR on sputum
   culture.  However this is unchanged from previous films and likely a
   chronic change.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with hypotension and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure. Blood cultures are pending, and she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which could be due to sepsis, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or RLL pneumonia. Further evaluation is needed, including sputum culture and CXR results.

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a moderate right effusion on CXR. This may contribute to her respiratory difficulties and requires further assessment.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has signs consistent with pneumonia, including cough productive of brown sputum, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, and RLL infiltrate on CXR.

5. T2 Paraplegia: The patient has chronic T2 paraplegia, which may contribute to her respiratory issues due to decreased lower extremity blood flow and muscle atrophy.

6. Hypokalemia: The patient had resolved hypokalemia, possibly due to intrinsic renal disease or potassium wasting. Monitoring and repletion of potassium are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. She is currently hemodynamically stable but has a fever of over 104 degrees overnight. There is uncertainty about the source of infection, as she is being treated for UTI and pneumonia. Gram-negative rods were found in her sputum, and there is a possibility of resistant Klebsiella and/or pseudomonas pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure suggest a possible septic state. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be due to UTI, pneumonia, or another source.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of gram-negative rods in her sputum and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate a possible pneumonia. The organism may be resistant to current antibiotics, which might require a switch to meropenem and double coverage for pseudomonas.
3. Drug fever: Although there are no visible rashes, drug fever should be considered as a possibility. It would be important to review the patient's medication history and consider discontinuing any potential offending agents.
4. Abscess or endocarditis: These conditions should be considered if the patient continues to spike fevers. Further imaging may be necessary to rule out"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia, intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia, and now admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's symptoms include spiking fever to >104 overnight, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure suggest the possibility of sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be related to the patient's history of UTIs and pneumonia. The presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum also raises suspicion for a bacterial infection.

2. Drug fever: Although there are no visible rashes, the patient's fever could be due to a drug reaction. Further assessment is needed to rule out this possibility.

3. Abscess or endocarditis: The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment raises concern for an abscess or endocarditis. Additional imaging studies may be necessary to evaluate these possibilities.

4. Pleural effusion: The patient's chest X-ray shows moderate right effusion, which could contribute to her respiratory failure. Further evaluation and management are required.

5. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of hypoxia and respiratory failure could also be attributed to pulmonary edema secondary to vigorous hydration or other underlying causes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of T2 paraplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pneumonia. She presents with sepsis and has positive findings for urinary analysis (U/A) and sputum culture. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's vital signs show fever, increased heart rate, and low blood pressure. She is intubated and sedated, with limited response to verbal stimuli. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no signs of infection or organomegaly. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. Imaging shows right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient may have urosepsis due to positive U/A or pneumonia as a possible source, indicated by RLL infiltrate on CXR. Blood cultures are pending.
2. Hypoxia: Possibilities include sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary edema. The patient is receiving vigorous hydration and treatment for RLL pneumonia.
3. T2 Paraplegia: Continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, and lyrica. Continue home bowel regimen.
4. Hypokalemia: Intrinsic renal disease vs. potassium wasting. Replete K with monitoring.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. The patient is currently admitted with hypotension and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's recent urinary culture showed Klebsiella resistant to Zosyn. The ID consult has been requested for today to consider discontinuing Zosyn. Vancomycin and azithromycin will continue.

The patient had a fever spike to >104 overnight, and the source is unclear. Possible causes include a history of Zosyn-resistant Klebsiella and possible resistant pseudomonas pneumonia given the recurrence of infections. An ID consult for possible change to meropenem today has been requested.

Other possibilities for the fever spike include viral cause, drug fever, abscess, or endocarditis. Further imaging should be considered if the patient continues to spike. 

The patient is fully resuscitated for septic shock, but will be weaned off levophed this morning. SVO2 is in the 70s, and IVF has been given for low CVP. Rechecking SVO2 in the morning is planned.

Regarding hypoxia and respiratory failure, possibilities include sepsis, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema s/p vigorous hydration, and right lower lobe pneumonia. The pneumonia fits with her cough productive of brown sputum.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of motor vehicle accident (MVA) and subsequent paraplegia since [**2142**]. She was admitted with hypotension and acute respiratory failure. She has intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonia. On admission, her temperature was 104.8°F, and she was placed on droplet precautions to rule out influenza. The patient's fever spiked to 102.4°F at 7 PM, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures were sent. She was given Tylenol and cooling blankets. Her temperature defervesced around 9 PM. The patient continues to be on low-dose levophed with arterial BPs in the 95-118/55-70 range. ABG results are normal, and ScvO2 was sent, which was above 70%. She has no known drug allergies.

   - CXR from [**10-9**]:  ET 3.9 cm above the carina.  Moderate right effusion
   and bilateral alveolar infiltrate that is more confluent and dense on
   today
s study, most marked in the left mid lung.  There is also
   increased infiltrate in the left lower lobe.  Assessment for change in
   infiltrate on the right is made difficult by the layering effusion but
   the infiltrate also looks slightly worse on the right.
   - CXR from [**10-10**]: My read: improvement in bilateral alveolar
   infiltrates.  Improved right sided pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia now admitted with
   hypotension and acute respiratory failure.
   # Sepsis: The patient does not have a clear source for her sepsis.  It
   is possible she has urosepsis given positive U/A.  Blood cultures
   pending.  Alternative source is a possible pneumonia, given history of
   mucous plugging, possible reduced ability to clear secretions secondary
   to her paraplegia.  Also, RLL infiltrate on CXR and 4+ GNR on sputum
   culture.  However this is unchanged from previous films and likely a
   chronic change.
   -fully resusciated for septic picture, attempt to wean levophed
   -SVO2 is 60, but pressors were held.  Given IVF for low CVP
   -based on previous culture data will treat with broad spectrum
   antibiotics with vanc, zosyn, and azithromycin for atypical coverage
   -f/u sputum speciation
   -f/u blood cultures
   -levophed to keep MAP > 65
   -placed a line
   # Hypoxia: as above possibilities include sepsis, pleural effusion,
   pulmonary edema s/p vigorous hydration, and RLL pneumonia.  Pneumonia
   fits with her cough productive of brown sputum.  F/u sputum cx and
   other cx data as above.  Given fever, muscle atrophy in lower
   extremities with decreased lower leg blood flow,  PE is less likely.
   -intubated and sedated; patient awakens at times and appears agitated.
   Will try to increase sedation
   -on AC 380X28
   -try to wean FIO2 or PEEP as tolerated
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   -continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, lyrica.
   -continue home bowel regimen.
   #Hypokalemia: resolved.  intrinsic renal disease vs. potassium wasting
   -replete K with monitoring

   Empiric broad spectrum abx.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  No change in Fi02 or
   ventilatory support needed.  Minimal yellow secretions so this has
   improved as well.
 FEVER:  High temperature overnight.  She is improving in the sense
   that they have been able to wean pressors down, secretions via ETT have
   diminished, CXR stable.  [**Month (only) 8**] try to turn off this am.  Given that she
   has grown Klebsiella in the past which may be likely to evolve
   resistance, will consider changing abx if continues to spike.  Follow
   up on culture results.  Also, do not see rash but will need to monitor
   given possibility of drug fever.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI):  On broad spectrum abx awaiting
   culutre results.
 HYPOXEMIA: Secondary to pneumonia.  Continue current support on MV,
   wearn PEEP and then consider dropping Fi02 as tolerated.
 HYPOKALEMIA:  Repleted. Check afternoon followup labs.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION:  Continues on broad spectrum

","The patient is a 50-year-old woman with T2 paraplegia admitted to the ICU for sepsis, pneumonia, and acute on chronic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at 5 cmH2O pressure support, 380 mL tidal volume, and 40% FiO2. She is comfortable with minimal secretions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/68 to 136/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her temperature is within normal range at 36.1-36.3°C.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and lansoprazole. She has also been on antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and now meropenem.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.8-10.4 thousand/mm3, anemia with a Hct of 26.2-33.7%, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 134-200 thousand/mm3. Her electrolytes reveal hyponatremia (Na+: 134-142 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (K+: 5.3-6.7 mEq/L), and hypocalcemia (Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL).

Imaging studies show an endotracheal tube and central line placement on chest X-ray, but no other significant findings. Microbiology reports indicate no growth in urine culture and moderate Gram-negative rods in sputum.

The patient's assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition due to tube feeds being held since midnight, acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, continuation of antibiotics, tolerance of minimal support on the ventilator, and plans for extubation after rounds. Other concerns include septic shock, hypoxemia, hypokalemia, anemia, and urinary tract infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, atelectasis, and aspiration pneumonia. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration or worsening respiratory status."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia admitted with fever,
   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Fever/Sepsis: afebrile overnight.  Thought that her spike to 104 2
   nights ago may be due to a resistant urinary or pulmonary bacterial
   infection given the patient
s history of recurrent infections.    Her
   sputum cx grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag +.
   -switch to levofloxacin
   -no double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time
   -d/c vanc (day 3); consider adding if she spikes fever
   -considered viral cause, her flu swab remains negative.
   -considered drug fever but no visible rashes.
   -consider abscess or endocarditis, but given her improvement upon
   changing antibiotics, we will hold off on further imaging.
   -successfully weaned off of levophed since 1AM with MAP > 70 throughout
   the night and uop > 30 cc/h
   -Give IVF for any drops in CVP. Recheck SVO2 in the AM.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: as above possibilities include
   atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to
   low phosphate secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Attempted extubation
   yesterday, but in setting of impending respiratory failure, was put
   back on AC 380X20 -> with FIO2 of 40% and her PEEP at 5.  Currently PS
   [**6-6**]. A RSBI was 69 this morning.
   - secretions have remained minimal and are improving.
    - place on Vit D replacement
   - 10mg IV lasix for fluid goal of -500cc
   # Anemia:  chronic normocytic anemia, with baseline hct in the 25-30
   range.  Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding.
   - guaiac stools and recheck hct in the afternoon.
   - B12, iron, folate studies
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   -continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, lyrica.
   -continue home bowel regimen.
   #Hypokalemia: repleted this AM.  Consider intrinsic renal disease vs.
   potassium wasting
   -replete K with monitoring
   FEN: Held tube feeds at mignight for possible extubation today.
   Yesterday begun tube feeds of Nutrem Pulm 20 cc/hr with goal rate of 40
   cc/hr.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia admitted with fever,
   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Fever/Sepsis: afebrile overnight.  Thought that her spike to 104 2
   nights ago may be due to a resistant urinary or pulmonary bacterial
   infection given the patient
s history of recurrent infections.
   -switched from zosyn  to meropenem yesterday (day 1: [**10-10**]).
   -no double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time
   -Continue vanc (day 3) to treat her UTI and pneumonia, given gram
   negative rods growing in her sputum.  D/c azithromycin.
   -vanc morning dose held; continue q24h.
   -considered viral cause, her flu swab remains negative.
   -considered drug fever but no visible rashes.
   -consider abscess or endocarditis, but given her improvement upon
   changing antibiotics, we will hold off on further imaging.
   -pan cultured.  F/u sputum speciation.
   -successfully weaned off of levophed since midnight with MAP > 70
   throughout the night and uop > 30 cc/h
   -Give IVF for any drops in CVP. Recheck SVO2 in the AM.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: as above possibilities include
   atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia.   Was on AC 380X20 ->
   with FIO2 weaned to 40% and her PEEP weaned to 5.  Currently PS 5/5. A
   RSBI was 110 down to 69 this afternoon.
   -secretions have remained minimal and are improving.
   -spontaneous breathing trial with possible extubation today.
   -fu on ABG from this AM
   # Anemia:  chronic normocytic anemia, with baseline hct in the 25-30
   range.  Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding.
   - guaiac stools and recheck hct in the afternoon.
   - B12, iron, folate studies
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   -continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, lyrica.
   -continue home bowel regimen.
   #Hypokalemia: repleted this AM.  Consider intrinsic renal disease vs.
   potassium wasting
   -replete K with monitoring
   FEN: Held tube feeds at mignight for possible extubation today.
   Yesterday begun tube feeds of Nutrem Pulm 20 cc/hr with goal rate of 40
   cc/hr.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and recurrent episodes of respiratory failure due to urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been through various medical interventions and complications during her stay in the ICU.

1. Invasive ventilation: The patient required invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. She was extubated but appeared to be in respiratory fatigue, so she had to be reintubated. The ventilator settings were adjusted, and ABG results improved.

2. CT chest: A CT chest without contrast was ordered to investigate any underlying lung pathology.

3. Sputum culture: The patient's sputum culture revealed pan-sensitive klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-positive. These findings guided the choice of antibiotics.

4. Antibiotics: The patient was initially on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin. Later, meropenem was started due to suspected resistant infection. The antibiotic regimen was adjusted based on culture results.

5. Haldol: The patient received some haldol overnight due to agitation.

6. Guaiac stool: The patient's guaiac stool test is pending.

7. Blood products: The patient received blood products, but the exact amount and frequency are"

   IMPRESSION:
   Diffuse ground-glass opacification in the left upper lobe and lingula
   have improved since the chest radiograph on the [**10-9**], probably
   improving consolidation due to infection, hemorrhage, or pulmonary
   edema.
   Chronic right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged back to [**2147-3-5**]
   CT with associated bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction.
   The focal ground-glass and consolidation in the right upper lobe has
   also improved since the recent chest radiographs.
   Left lower lobe atelectasis has partially cleared since the previous
   CT. Moderate residual atelectasis,consolidatio, mucoid impaction, and
   peribronchial wall thickening suggest recent infection.
   The ET tube could be withdrawn 2-3 cm to a more optimal position.

   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently on AC 380X20 -> with FIO2 of
   40% and her PEEP at 5.

   -Give IVF for any drops in CVP. Recheck SVO2 in the AM.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently on AC 380X20 -> with FIO2 of
   40% and her PEEP at 5.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure but is now hemodynamically stable. She has been receiving antibiotics for a total of 8 days, including meropenem and levofloxacin. Her sputum culture showed pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag +. She was successfully weaned off of levophed with a MAP > 70 and UOP > 30 cc/h. She has been given IVF for any drops in CVP and her SVO2 will be rechecked in the AM. She is currently on AC 380X20 with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP at 5. Her chest CT final read is still pending. She received 10mg IV lasix X 2 yesterday with a diuresis of 950cc over 36 hours. MIE is being considered as the patient does not have a good cough mechanism. She is also on Vit D replacement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Sepsis: The patient's sputum culture showed pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag +. Despite being on antibiotics, there is still a risk of sepsis if the infection is not completely eradicated.
2. Hypoxia and"

   Diffuse ground-glass opacification in the left upper lobe and lingula
   have improved since the chest radiograph on the [**10-9**], probably
   improving consolidation due to infection, hemorrhage, or pulmonary
   edema.
   Chronic right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged back to [**2147-3-5**]

   The focal ground-glass and consolidation in the right upper lobe has
   also improved since the recent chest radiographs.
   Left lower lobe atelectasis has partially cleared since the previous
   CT. Moderate residual atelectasis,consolidatio, mucoid impaction, and

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. Currently, she is hemodynamically stable.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Sepsis: The patient had a fever overnight, but it resolved. Her sputum culture grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus coag +. The antibiotics were switched from meropenem to levofloxacin for an 8-day course. No double coverage for pseudomonas was initiated at this time. Vanc may be considered if the patient spikes a fever. A viral cause is also being considered, but the flu swab remains negative. Drug fever is being ruled out, and further imaging for abscess or endocarditis will be considered if there is no improvement with the current antibiotic regimen.
2. Hypoxia and respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation could be due to atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, or low phosphate secondary to Vit D deficiency. She is currently on AC 380X20 with FIO2 of 40% and PEEP at 5. Secretions yesterday caused a brief drop in oxygen saturation. Continued abx txt and suctioning are recommended.

   IMPRESSION:
   Diffuse ground-glass opacification in the left upper lobe and lingula
   have improved since the chest radiograph on the [**10-9**], probably
   improving consolidation due to infection, hemorrhage, or pulmonary
   edema.
   Chronic right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged back to [**2147-3-5**]
   CT with associated bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction.
   The focal ground-glass and consolidation in the right upper lobe has
   also improved since the recent chest radiographs.
   Left lower lobe atelectasis has partially cleared since the previous
   CT. Moderate residual atelectasis,consolidatio, mucoid impaction, and
   peribronchial wall thickening suggest recent infection.
   The ET tube could be withdrawn 2-3 cm to a more optimal position.
   Abdominal ascites.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia admitted with fever,
   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently on AC 380X20 -> with FIO2 of
   40% and her PEEP at 5.
   - secretions yesterday caused a brief drop in oxygen saturation.
   Continued abx txt and suctioning.
   - chest CT final read still pending
   - given 10mg IV lasix X 2 yesterday with diuresis of 950cc over 36
   hours.
   - consider MIE as pt does not have good cough mechanism
   - try to decrease FIO2 today
    -continue on Vit D replacement
   .
   # Fever/Sepsis: afebrile overnight.  Her sputum cx grew pan-sensitive
   klebsiella and staph aureus coag +.
   -switch meropenem to levofloxacin (day 1: [**10-12**]) yesterday for total 8
   day course (today is day 5 of abx). 3 more days of abx.
   -no double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time
   -consider adding vanc if she spikes fever
   -considered viral cause, her flu swab remains negative.
   -considered drug fever but no visible rashes.
   -consider abscess or endocarditis, but given her improvement upon
   changing antibiotics, we will hold off on further imaging.
   -successfully weaned off of levophed with MAP > 70 throughout the night
   and uop > 30 cc/h
   -Give IVF for any drops in CVP. Recheck SVO2 in the AM.
   .
   # Anemia:  chronic normocytic anemia, with baseline hct in the 25-30
   range.  Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding.
   - Hct stable this AM
   - B12, iron, folate studies
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   -continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, lyrica.
   -continue home bowel regimen.
   #Hypokalemia: repleted this AM.  Consider intrinsic renal disease vs.
   potassium wasting
   -replete K with monitoring
   FEN: Held tube feeds at mignight for possible extubation today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. She is currently hemodynamically stable but has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia and respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation could be due to atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, or low phosphate secondary to Vit D deficiency. She is currently on AC 380X20 with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP at 5. Secretions yesterday caused a brief drop in oxygen saturation. Continued abx txt and suctioning are recommended.
2. Fever/Sepsis: The patient had a fever, but she is now afebrile overnight. Her sputum cx grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag +. The antibiotic meropenem was switched to levofloxacin yesterday for an 8-day course. Three more days of abx are needed. No double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time. Consider adding vanc if she spikes fever, and further imaging may be necessary to rule out abscess or endocarditis.
3. Anemia: The patient has chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline hct in the 25-30 range. Hemodynamically"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have a history of chronic respiratory failure and are currently intubated. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 118/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue and nutritional support through tube feeds.

The patient's physical examination reveals general obesity, normal breath sounds with scattered crackles and diminished breath sounds dependently, soft and non-tender abdomen, and edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination is not fully assessed due to the patient being intubated.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.4 g/dL, hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dL, sodium of 129 mEq/L, potassium of 4.7 mEq/L, blood glucose of 94 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill, overweight/obese individual with respiratory failure. They have been intubated and continue to receive mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 118/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's recent medical history includes an episode of desaturation that improved with suctioning, as well as being on pressors, which have since been discontinued. The patient has a history of allergies to no known medications and has received multiple courses of antibiotics. They are currently on levoquin for Klebsiella pneumonia and have been started on diuretics. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes, except for low potassium and magnesium levels, which are being repleted as needed. The patient's arterial blood gas shows a slightly elevated pH and low carbon dioxide levels. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, continuous mandatory ventilation with assist, auto-flow, set tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory system compliance of 29.2 cmH2O/mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%, and a respiratory system resistance index of 225.

   [**2147-10-12**]
   IMPRESSION:
   Diffuse ground-glass opacification in the left upper lobe and lingula
   have improved since the chest radiograph on the [**10-9**], probably
   improving consolidation due to infection, hemorrhage, or pulmonary
   edema.
   Chronic right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged back to [**2147-3-5**]
   CT with associated bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction.
   The focal ground-glass and consolidation in the right upper lobe has
   also improved since the recent chest radiographs.
   Left lower lobe atelectasis has partially cleared since the previous
   CT. Moderate residual atelectasis,consolidatio, mucoid impaction, and
   peribronchial wall thickening suggest recent infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia admitted with fever,
   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently on AC 380X20 -> with FIO2 of
   50% and her PEEP at 5.
   - secretions yesterday caused a brief drop in oxygen saturation.
   Continued abx txt and suctioning.
   - bronch showed no secretions
   - chest CT shows improvement in diffuse ground glass opacification.
   Atelectasis in RLL stable.  LLL atelectasis has partially cleared.
   - given 20mg IV lasix X 2 yesterday with diuresis of 2150 over last 36
   hours.
   - will continue with 20mg IV Lasix today with goal diuresis of 2 L
   - consider MIE as outpt does not have good cough mechanism
   - if clinically improves, consider PS trial
    -continue on Vit D replacement
   .
   # Fever/Sepsis: afebrile overnight.  Her sputum cx grew pan-sensitive
   klebsiella and staph aureus coag +.
   -switch meropenem to levofloxacin (day 1: [**10-12**]) yesterday for total 8
   day course (today is day 5 of abx). 3 more days of abx.
   -no double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time
   -consider adding vanc if she spikes fever
   -considered viral cause, her flu swab remains negative.
   -considered drug fever but no visible rashes.
   -consider abscess or endocarditis, but given her improvement upon
   changing antibiotics, we will hold off on further imaging.
   -successfully weaned off of levophed with MAP > 70 throughout the night
   and uop > 30 cc/h
   -Give IVF for any drops in CVP. Recheck SVO2 in the AM.
   .
   # abdominal ascites: unclear etiology.  Will obtain albumin, LFTs.
   # Anemia:  chronic normocytic anemia, with baseline hct in the 25-30
   range.  Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding.
   - Hct stable this AM
   - B12, iron, folate studies
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   -continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, lyrica.
   -continue home bowel regimen.
   #Hypokalemia: repleted this AM.  Consider intrinsic renal disease vs.
   potassium wasting
   -replete K with monitoring
   FEN: Held tube feeds at mignight for possible extubation today.
   Yesterday begun tube feeds of Nutrem Pulm 20 cc/hr with goal rate of 40

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo female with h/o paraplegia and recurrent UTI and pnuemonia now
   admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure.  She currently has had
   significant improvement in sepsis with WBC decreased and BP able to be
   maintained off of pressors.  Of note, she does have intermittent
   hypoxemia while on ventilatory support but has tolerated diuresis quite
   well.
   1)Respiratory Failure-At this time she has current limitations of
   restriction from abdomen, mild contribution of volume overload and
   likely pulmonary edema.  This, however, appears to be relatively
   minimal in the setting of positive pressure.  She will need to
   -Continue diuresis today
   -Re-evaluate with RSBI this pm
   -Continue to wean PSV today
   -look to extubation in AM with true optimization
   2)Sepsis-Off pressors, good resposne, cultures following initial
   negative-
   -goal negative fluid balance
   -Day 6 of ABX
Levoflox to continue for 8 days

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonia. She was admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has shown significant improvement in her sepsis with a decrease in white blood cell count and blood pressure maintained without the need for pressors. However, she still experiences intermittent hypoxemia while on ventilatory support.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors such as restriction from the abdomen, mild volume overload, and pulmonary edema. The patient needs to continue diuresis, re-evaluate with respiratory system compliance index (RSBI), continue to wean pressure support ventilation (PSV), and look towards extubation in the morning with optimized conditions.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis response is good and off pressors, it is important to maintain a negative fluid balance and continue with appropriate antibiotics. Levofloxacin should be continued for an additional 8 days.

Additional issues to be addressed include alterations in nutrition, hypoxemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, and ICU care.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory failure, sepsis, and other medical complications."

   [**2147-10-12**]
   IMPRESSION:
   Diffuse ground-glass opacification in the left upper lobe and lingula
   have improved since the chest radiograph on the [**10-9**], probably
   improving consolidation due to infection, hemorrhage, or pulmonary
   edema.
   Chronic right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged back to [**2147-3-5**]
   CT with associated bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction.
   The focal ground-glass and consolidation in the right upper lobe has
   also improved since the recent chest radiographs.
   Left lower lobe atelectasis has partially cleared since the previous
   CT. Moderate residual atelectasis,consolidatio, mucoid impaction, and
   peribronchial wall thickening suggest recent infection.
   The ET tube could be withdrawn 2-3 cm to a more optimal position.
   Abdominal ascites.
   CXR [**10-14**]: my read: improvement in bibasilar pleural
   effusion/atelectasis
   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia admitted with fever,
   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently on AC 380X16 -> with FIO2 of
   40% and her PEEP at 5.  Weaned to PS this AM.
   - secretions yesterday caused a brief drop in oxygen saturation.
   Continued abx txt and suctioning.  Bronchoscopy showed no visible
   secretions.
   - chest CT shows improvement in diffuse ground glass opacification.
   Atelectasis in RLL stable.  LLL atelectasis has partially cleared.
   - given 20mg IV lasix X 2 yesterday with diuresis of 2150 cc over 36
   hours.
   - will continue with 20mg IV Lasix today with goal diuresis of 2 L
   - consider MIE as outpt does not have good cough mechanism
   - if clinically improves, consider PS trial
    -continue on Vit D replacement
   .
   # Fever/Sepsis: afebrile overnight.  Her sputum cx grew pan-sensitive
   klebsiella and staph aureus coag +.
   -switch meropenem to levofloxacin (day 1: [**10-12**]) yesterday for total 8
   day course (today is day 6 of abx). 2 more days of abx.
   -no double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time
   -consider adding vanc if she spikes fever
   -considered viral cause, her flu swab remains negative.
   -considered drug fever but no visible rashes.
   -consider abscess or endocarditis, but given her improvement upon
   changing antibiotics, we will hold off on further imaging.
   -successfully weaned off of levophed with MAP > 70 throughout the night
   and uop > 30 cc/h
   -Give IVF for any drops in CVP. Recheck SVO2 in the AM.
   .
   # Anemia:  chronic normocytic anemia, with baseline hct in the 25-30
   range.  Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding.
   - Hct stable this AM
   - B12, iron, folate studies
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   -continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, lyrica.
   -continue home bowel regimen.
   #Hypokalemia: repleted this AM.  Consider intrinsic renal disease vs.
   potassium wasting
   -replete K with monitoring
   FEN: Held tube feeds at mignight for possible extubation today.
   Yesterday begun tube feeds of Nutrem Pulm 20 cc/hr with goal rate of 40
   cc/hr.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure but is now hemodynamically stable.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypoxia and respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing episodes of respiratory failure. Possible causes include atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, and low phosphate secondary to Vit D deficiency. The patient is currently on AC 380X16 with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP at 5, which indicates ongoing respiratory support.

2. Fever/Sepsis: The patient had a fever and was found to have pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag + in her sputum culture. She is currently being treated with levofloxacin for a total of 8 days of antibiotic therapy. There is no mention of double coverage for pseudomonas at this time.

3. Anemia: The patient has chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline Hct in the 25-30 range. No obvious sources of bleeding have been identified. Further investigations such as B12, iron, folate studies are needed to determine the cause of anemia.

4. T2 Paraplegia: The patient has a history of T2 par"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia admitted with fever,
   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently on SBT
   - continued abx txt and suctioning.  Bronchoscopy showed no visible
   secretions.
   - chest CT shows improvement in diffuse ground glass opacification.
   Atelectasis in RLL stable.  LLL atelectasis has partially cleared.
   - given 20mg IV lasix X 2 yesterday with diuresis of 2150 cc over 36
   hours.
   - will continue with 20mg IV Lasix today with goal diuresis of 2 L
   - consider MIE as outpt does not have good cough mechanism
   - if clinically improves, consider PS trial
    -continue on Vit D replacement
   .
   # Fever/Sepsis: afebrile overnight.  Her sputum cx grew pan-sensitive
   klebsiella and staph aureus coag +.
   -switch meropenem to levofloxacin (day 1: [**10-12**]) yesterday for total 8
   day course (today is day 6 of abx). 2 more days of abx.
   -no double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time
   -consider adding vanc if she spikes fever
   -considered viral cause, her flu swab remains negative.
   -considered drug fever but no visible rashes.
   -consider abscess or endocarditis, but given her improvement upon
   changing antibiotics, we will hold off on further imaging.
   -successfully weaned off of levophed with MAP > 70 throughout the night
   and uop > 30 cc/h
   -Give IVF for any drops in CVP. Recheck SVO2 in the AM.
   .
   # Anemia:  chronic normocytic anemia, with baseline hct in the 25-30
   range.  Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding.
   - Hct stable this AM
   - B12, iron, folate studies
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   -continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, lyrica.
   -continue home bowel regimen.
   #Hypokalemia: repleted this AM.  Consider intrinsic renal disease vs.
   potassium wasting
   -replete K with monitoring
   FEN: Held tube feeds at mignight for possible extubation today.
   Yesterday begun tube feeds of Nutrem Pulm 20 cc/hr with goal rate of 40

","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of motor vehicle accident and subsequent T2 paraplegia, admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hypoxia and respiratory failure: This can be due to atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, or low phosphate secondary to Vitamin D deficiency. The patient is currently on spontaneous breathing trials and will continue with diuresis using Lasix.

2. Fever/Sepsis: The patient's sputum culture grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus coag +. Antibiotic therapy has been switched from meropenem to levofloxacin for a total of 8 days. Additional coverage for pseudomonas is not being provided at this time. The possibility of adding vancomycin if the patient spikes a fever is being considered.

3. Anemia: The patient has chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline Hct in the range of 25-30. There are no obvious sources of bleeding, and the patient is hemodynamically stable. B12, iron, and folate studies are needed.

4. T2 Paraplegia: The patient's paraplegia is due to a previous motor vehicle accident. The home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, and lyrica should"

Continue on Vit D replacement. Extubation today.
2. Fever/Sepsis: The patient's sputum culture grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag +. Discontinue levofloxacin. No double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time. Give IVF for any drops in CVP. Recheck SVO2 in the AM.
3. Anemia: The patient has chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline Hct in the 25-30 range. Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding. H"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia admitted with fever,
   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently on AC 380X16 -> with FIO2 of
   40% and her PEEP at 5.  Weaned to PS this AM.
   - secretions yesterday caused a brief drop in oxygen saturation.
   Continued abx txt and suctioning.  Bronchoscopy showed no visible
   secretions.
   - chest CT shows improvement in diffuse ground glass opacification.
   Atelectasis in RLL stable.  LLL atelectasis has partially cleared.
   - given 20mg IV lasix X 2 yesterday with diuresis of 2150 cc over 36
   hours.
   - will continue with 20mg IV Lasix today with goal diuresis of 2 L
   - consider MIE as outpt does not have good cough mechanism
   - if clinically improves, consider PS trial
    -continue on Vit D replacement
   .
   # Fever/Sepsis: afebrile overnight.  Her sputum cx grew pan-sensitive
   klebsiella and staph aureus coag +.
   -switch meropenem to levofloxacin (day 1: [**10-12**]) yesterday for total 8
   day course (today is day 6 of abx). 2 more days of abx.
   -no double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time
   -consider adding vanc if she spikes fever
   -considered viral cause, her flu swab remains negative.
   -considered drug fever but no visible rashes.
   -consider abscess or endocarditis, but given her improvement upon
   changing antibiotics, we will hold off on further imaging.
   -successfully weaned off of levophed with MAP > 70 throughout the night
   and uop > 30 cc/h
   -Give IVF for any drops in CVP. Recheck SVO2 in the AM.
   .
   # Anemia:  chronic normocytic anemia, with baseline hct in the 25-30
   range.  Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding.
   - Hct stable this AM
   - B12, iron, folate studies
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   -continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, lyrica.
   -continue home bowel regimen.
   #Hypokalemia: repleted this AM.  Consider intrinsic renal disease vs.
   potassium wasting
   -replete K with monitoring
   FEN: Held tube feeds at mignight for possible extubation today.
   Yesterday begun tube feeds of Nutrem Pulm 20 cc/hr with goal rate of 40
   cc/hr.

   50 yo female with history of paraplegia and respiratory failure with
   initial sepsis likely related to urinary tract infection with systemic
   insult and now with respiratory failure in that setting.  She has
   persistent restrictive ventilatory defect and does have some
   limitations in terms of supporting increased efforts for cough and
   secreation clearance but has quite a favorable set of findings of good
   mental status, minimal secreations, RSBI favorable, good tolerance of
   45 minutes of SBT and with suggestion of pneumonia clearance at 8 days
   of ABX and with modest volume overload improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia and respiratory failure. She initially presented with sepsis likely related to a urinary tract infection and now has respiratory failure. She has a persistent restrictive ventilatory defect and some limitations in supporting increased efforts for cough and secretion clearance. However, she has a favorable set of findings including good mental status, minimal secretions, a favorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI), and tolerance of 45 minutes of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). She has also shown improvement in pneumonia clearance after 8 days of antibiotic therapy and has a modest volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue or worsen if she is unable to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation after extubation.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently on appropriate antibiotics for Klebsiella UTI, there is a risk of further infection and sepsis if the bacteria becomes resistant to the medication or if a new infection occurs.
3. Pneumonia: Despite improvement, there is still a risk of pneumonia recurrence or worsening due to her compromised respiratory status and potential aspiration.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient has a modest volume overload, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiac issues.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's paraplegia increases her risk for pressure ulcers, deep"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-15**]:
   - extubated today
   - 2 hours later, complained of acute pleuritic RUQ. Got CXR which
   showed worsening right pleural effusion, RLL and RML collapse,
   posterior 5th rib fracture which are subacute. Repeat CXR confirmed the
   1st CXR.
   - repeat ABG on non-rebreather showed low oxygenation: 7.39/53/57/33.
   given lasix 20mg IV x1.
   - the team discussed the necessity of re-intubation given new right
   lung collapse/plugging and inability to cough, and plan of tracheostomy
   in a couple of days, pt refused
   - pt given morphine, ativan for pain and anxiety
   - repeat ABG was reassuring: 7.39/57/142/36. satting well on NRB 40%
   FiO2 at 100%. HR and BP well controlled as well.
   - goal -1L today
   - reviewed sputum culture data: coag+ staph aureus was found in sputum,
   resistant to levoquin, unsure why it was not addressed earlier. on the

CXR ([**10-15**]) The current study was obtained with significant rotation of the patie
nt. Despite that, there is an impression that there is increase in the right ple
ural effusion compared to the prior study. In addition, there might be also an e
lement of atelectasis giving the rapid termination of the right main bronchus an
d potential mediastinal deviation to the right. The right internal jugular line
tip is at the level of mid SVC. Left lung is unchanged. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Followup with chest radiograph, within the short interval time is
recommended with symmetric position of the patient.
Some of the multiple rib fractures on the right are not clearly accompanied with
 callus amd might be subacute. If nessesary, correlation with dedicated rib view
s might be considered.

   stable.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently extubated. CXR showed
   increased right pleural effusions with most likely subacute posterior
   rib fractures

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. She is now hemodynamically stable. The patient has multiple complications including hypoxia and respiratory failure, fever/sepsis, anemia, T2 paraplegia, hypokalemia, and potential complications from subacute rib fractures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia and respiratory failure: The patient may experience ongoing difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels due to atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, or low phosphate secondary to Vit D deficiency.
2. Increased right pleural effusion: The patient has an increased right pleural effusion, which can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential infection.
3. Subacute rib fractures: The patient has subacute rib fractures, which can cause pain and compromise ventilation, leading to respiratory distress.
4. Sepsis: The patient had a previous infection with pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag+, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline hct in the 25-30 range. This could be due to chronic disease or other underlying causes.

CXR ([**10-15**]) The current study was obtained with significant rotation of the patie
nt. Despite that, there is an impression that there is increase in the right ple
ural effusion compared to the prior study. In addition, there might be also an e
lement of atelectasis giving the rapid termination of the right main bronchus an
d potential mediastinal deviation to the right. The right internal jugular line
tip is at the level of mid SVC. Left lung is unchanged. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Followup with chest radiograph, within the short interval time is
recommended with symmetric position of the patient.
Some of the multiple rib fractures on the right are not clearly accompanied with
 callus and might be subacute. If nessesary, correlation with dedicated rib view
s might be considered.

   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently extubated. CXR showed
   increased right pleural effusions vs. RML/RLL lung collapse with
   subacute posterior rib fractures.  Due to little change after extensive
   diuresis and unilateral picture, most likely lung collapse.  She is
   currently day [**7-10**] of her levo abx treatment

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. She is now hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia and respiratory failure: The patient may experience atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, or low phosphate secondary to Vitamin D deficiency. Currently, there is an increased right pleural effusion and RML/RLL lung collapse with subacute posterior rib fractures. Noninvasive measures such as CPAP will be tried, followed by repeat ABG. Diuresis with 20mg IV Lasix will be considered with a goal of 1 L diuresis pending clinical status.
2. Fever/Sepsis: The patient's sputum culture grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag +. Continuous levo abx treatment will be continued, and no double coverage for pseudomonas will be begun at this time.

   - extubated today
   - 2 hours later, complained of acute pleuritic RUQ. Got CXR which
   showed worsening right pleural effusion, RLL and RML collapse,
   posterior 5th rib fracture which are subacute. Repeat CXR confirmed the
   1st CXR.
   - repeat ABG on non-rebreather showed low oxygenation: 7.39/53/57/33.
   given lasix 20mg IV x1.
   - the team discussed the necessity of re-intubation given new right
   lung collapse/plugging and inability to cough, and plan of tracheostomy
   in a couple of days, pt refused
   - pt given morphine, ativan for pain and anxiety
   - repeat ABG was reassuring: 7.39/57/142/36. satting well on NRB 40%

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of motor vehicle accident and subsequent T2 paraplegia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. She is currently stable hemodynamically but has been experiencing episodes of respiratory failure due to urinary tract infections and pneumonia. The patient has been extubated but is now presenting with acute pleuritic right upper quadrant pain. A chest X-ray revealed worsening right pleural effusion, right middle lobe collapse, and posterior fifth rib fracture which are subacute. The patient's ABG showed low oxygenation and she was given Lasix 20mg IV. Due to worsening lung collapse and inability to cough effectively, the team discussed the necessity of reintubation, but the patient refused. She was given morphine and ativan for pain and anxiety. The repeat ABG was reassuring with improved oxygenation levels. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and she is on non-rebreather with FiO2 at 100%. The patient's sputum culture grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag +.

   Imaging: CXR--Persistent and significant right sided collapse
   Microbiology: Sputum, Urine, Blood--NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo female with history of MVC and T2 paraplegia now with admission
   with recurrent fever and sepsis with likely urinary source with
   complication of respiratory failure and now with persistent respiratory
   compromise following extubation with right sided collapse seen in RLL
   and RML in the setting of rib fractures and weakness.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient has good evidence of controlled
   infection.  She has limited capacity for secretion clearance and is
   faced with continued need for cough and sputum clearance which is mixed
   with right sided collapse and persistent hypoxemia.  With continued
   close support she has maintained elevated O2 requirement and
   persistence of collapse through to this morning with increase in PO2
   likely only attributable to the increased flow rate of O2 delivery.
   -Will need cough and deep breath
   -Will trial intermittent positive pressure ventilation via the mask
   today
   -Will trial incentive spirometry
   -Will need to maintain adequate pain control
   -Will have to continue to press and educate patient that this clinical
   course is going to be most clearly and safely conducted via intubation
   and tracheostomy but at this time she has made an informed decision to
   refuse intubation at this time despite increased risk of adverse event
   and death in the setting of urgent decline.
   Should we see a pattern of no change over time we will have to make a
   decision to intubate to allow advancement of her care given issues such
   as .
   2)Pneumonia-Klebsiella and Staph species seen
   -Patient with Meropenem
Levofloxacin on day #6
   -Remains with afebrile status and WBC wnl.
   3)Pain Control-She has reasonable control of pain intermittently but
   will need to have maximization of control with minimization of
   respiratory supression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of motor vehicle collision and T2 paraplegia. She was admitted with recurrent fever and sepsis, likely of urinary origin. She also has respiratory failure and persistent respiratory compromise following extubation. The patient has limited capacity for secretion clearance and is experiencing right-sided collapse seen in the right lower lobe and middle lobe in the setting of rib fractures and weakness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient has controlled infection but limited capacity for cough and sputum clearance. She requires close support to maintain elevated O2 requirement and persistence of collapse. The patient may need to trial intermittent positive pressure ventilation via a mask, incentive spirometry, and maintain adequate pain control. There is an increased risk of adverse events and death if urgent decline occurs.
2) Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by Klebsiella and Staph species. She is on meropenem and levofloxacin but remains febrile. The white blood cell count is within normal limits.
3) Pain Control: The patient has intermittent control of pain but needs maximization of pain control with minimal respiratory suppression. She is currently on methadone, baclofen, lidocaine patch, and lyrica.
4) Alteration in Nutrition: The patient needs feeds and may require maintaining tube feeds if unable to take oral intake safely.
5) ICU Care: The patient is currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of motor vehicle accident resulting in T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to urinary tract infections and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for approximately 8-9 days and is currently experiencing hypoxia and respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/64 mmHg to 134/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her current weight is 68.4 kg, which is lower than her admission weight of 72.3 kg. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,080 mL of total fluids, with 420 mL through the oral route, 540 mL through intravenous fluids, and 120 mL through the transfluent route. Output includes 2,120 mL of urine and 319 mL of stool. The overall fluid balance is -1,040 mL.

The patient's respiratory support consists of high-flow nasal cannula with oxygen delivery at 15L/min on 80% FiO2, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 114, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side with fine crackles, soft non-tender abdomen, no extremity edema, and no lower abdominal distress. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 265 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, blood glucose of 86 mg/dL, calcium level of 8.9 mg/dL, magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 2.8 mg/dL. 

Microbiology tests indicate negative C. difficile, rare yeast in sputum culture, and positive K. pneumoniae and S. aureus coag + in sputum culture. Urine culture also shows N. gonorrhoeae, and blood culture shows N. gonorrhoeae as well. Chest X-ray today reveals increased right pleural effusions with subacute posterior rib fractures. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypoxia and respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was extubated on [**10-15**]. CXR showed increased right pleural effusions vs. with subacute posterior rib fractures. Due to little change after extensive diuresis and unilateral picture, most likely lung collapse.

- The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of motor vehicle accident and subsequent paraplegia since [2142]. She also has intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to urinary tract infections and pneumonia.
- She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. She was intubated but extubated on [10-15].
- The patient is currently on day [8-9] of her levo antibiotic treatment.
- She is showing improvement with noninvasive measures, including CPAP, which she tolerates well and sleeps without at night.
- There is a consideration for arterial line placement versus ABG pending clinical status.
- The patient is encouraged to continue coughing, taking deep breaths, and using an inspiratory spirometer.
- Pain control is being maintained on the current regimen.
- There is consideration for MIE (mechanical inhaled expercotrans) as an outpatient treatment option since the patient does not have a good cough mechanism.
- Vit D and phosphate replacement continue.
- The patient has pneumonia with a sputum culture growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus coag +. She is currently on levo antibiotics.
- Anemia is chronic normocytic with a baseline Hct in the 25-30 range. The patient is hemodynamically stable with no"

   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia admitted with fever,
   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently extubated. CXR showed
   increased right pleural effusions vs. RML/RLL lung collapse with
   subacute posterior rib fractures.  Due to little change after extensive
   diuresis and unilateral picture, most likely lung collapse.  She is

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of motor vehicle accident (MVA) and subsequent paraplegia since 2142. She has been admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's current assessment includes hypoxia and respiratory failure, fever/sepsis, anemia, T2 paraplegia, and hypokalemia.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/64 to 134/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow neb with 80% FiO2. The patient's weight has decreased from 72.3 kg at admission to 68.4 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels within the 24.5-27.5 g/dL range, and platelet count ranging from 160 to 265 K/uL. Blood chemistry values are within normal limits, except for slightly elevated potassium levels at 3.7 mEq/L and low phosphate levels at 0.4 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies reveal increased right pleural effusions and right middle lobe lung collapse with subacute posterior rib fractures. These findings suggest a possible pneumonia or"

   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.  Now hemodynamically
   stable.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: possibilities include atelectasis,
   small pleural effusions, pneumonia.  Could also be due to low phosphate
   secondary to Vit D deficiency.  Currently extubated. CXR showed
   increased right pleural effusions vs. RML/RLL lung collapse with
   subacute posterior rib fractures.  Due to little change after extensive
   diuresis and unilateral picture, most likely lung collapse.  She is
   currently day [**7-10**] of her levo abx treatment
   - pt. currently does not want to be re-intubated unless under dire
   circumstances.  We will try noninvasive measures, CPAP.
   - repeat ABG after CPAP
   - continued abx txt and suctioning.  Currently day [**7-10**].
   - will consider diuresis with 20mg IV Lasix today with goal diuresis of
   1 L pending clinical status
   - consider MIE as outpt does not have good cough mechanism

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia and respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently experiencing hypoxia. This could be due to atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, or low phosphate secondary to Vitamin D deficiency. The CXR showed increased right pleural effusions versus RML/RLL lung collapse with subacute posterior rib fractures. The most likely cause seems to be lung collapse. The patient is currently on noninvasive measures, such as CPAP, and diuretics with Lasix. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and respiratory status is necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient had a fever initially, indicating possible sepsis. Her sputum culture grew pan-sensitive klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus coag +. She is currently on levofloxacin, but no double coverage was begun for pseudomonas at this time. Continuous monitoring of her vital signs and clinical status is important.

3. Anemia: The patient has chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline Hct in the 25-30 range."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with T2 paraplegia and respiratory failure. She presented with urinary sepsis and has been receiving conservative support for significant right-sided collapse with intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 133/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high-flow nasal cannula. She is overweight/obese, with diminished breath sounds on the chest examination. Extremity edema is noted in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, and decreased total protein. Imaging shows improved aeration in the right lung, indicating recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may persist or worsen if oxygenation and ventilation support are not adequately maintained.
2. Infection: The patient's history of urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis indicates a risk of ongoing or recurrent infections, which can lead to worsening sepsis or organ dysfunction.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia and findings on imaging suggest a potential risk for pneumonia recurrence or progression.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility due to paraplegia and ICU stay increase the"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia and respiratory failure, contributing factors including right middle lobe/right lower lobe lung collapse, atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, and pain. She was extubated on [**10-15**] but due to little change after extensive diuresis and unilateral lung picture, most likely lung collapse, her current condition is still concerning.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5%), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 136/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow neb with FiO2 80%. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right lung with fine crackles, soft non-tender abdomen, and no extremity edema. The patient's recent laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels, except for hypokalemia. The patient's sputum culture grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staph"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo female with h/o T2 paraplegia now with urinary source of sepsis
   and subsequent respiratory failure now with slow to improve
   atelectasis/collpase in right lung fields. She did have some transient
   improvment with conservative measures but now has had recurrence of
   complete collapse of right lung with mild/moderate impairment of
   oxygenation in that setting.  The source of collapse is still most
   likely weakess in capacity for secretion clearance both due to
   paraplegia and rib fracture which makes this a likely chronic challenge
   until full strength regained.
   1)Respiratory Failure and Hypoxemia secondary to atelectasis- Current
   conservative strategy has had limited result in truly being able to
   achieve sustained benefit in terms of oxygenation, aeration and
   resolutoin of collapse.  We had discussed extensively with her the
   pathway or intubation, bronchoscopy and likely tracheostomy as most
   likely course.
   -Will continue with IPPV
   -Will trial mucormyst today to aid in clearance
   -Trial flutter valve
   -To pursue with bronchoscopy would be perhaps best pursued with
   bronchoscopy via ETT given the amount of secretions needed to be
   cleared.  Will pursue if unable to return to improvement without
   intervention

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of T2 paraplegia who has developed urinary sepsis and subsequent respiratory failure. She experienced transient improvement with conservative measures but now has a recurrence of complete collapse of the right lung with mild/moderate impairment of oxygenation. The source of collapse is likely due to weakness in secretion clearance caused by paraplegia and a rib fracture, which is expected to be a chronic challenge until full strength is regained.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure and hypoxemia secondary to atelectasis. Conservative measures have had limited results in achieving sustained benefits in terms of oxygenation, aeration, and resolution of collapse. The plan moving forward includes continuing with intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), trialing mucormyst to aid in clearance, and trying a flutter valve. If the patient does not improve without intervention, bronchoscopy via endotracheal tube (ETT) will be pursued to clear the amount of secretions.

Additionally, the patient has other medical issues such as anxiety, alteration in nutrition, h/o pneumonia, h/o urinary tract infection (UTI), hypoxemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving a po diet, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines for access, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers,"

   - pt requested that she be re-intubated in the pm as she was more
   dyspneic on non-rebreather. anesthesiology came and intubated her. soon
   afterwards, patient had bradycardia and went into PEA, and pt was
   coded. Patient was resuscitated with CPR, 3 epi and 2 atropine, 1 amp
   bicarb, 5u insulin and 1amp dextrose. During the code, it was difficult
   to bag patient, indicating central airway was plugged. after about 4min
   pulse came back, patient was intially hypertensive with SBP in 170s,
   tachycardic at 150s with SVT, possibly AVNRT, she became hypotensive
   with SBP in the 80-90s as well. Patient was bronch'd immediately,
   copious secretions were suctioned, and post-bronch cxr showed part of
   the right lung re-opened up. Following bronch, BP and HR improved. EKG
   following bronch showed inferior ischemia (TWI in II, III, avF), and
   anterolateral ischemia (ST depression in V3-V6). CK: 28  MB: 4  Trop-T:

   - ABG was obtained post-code and vent setting was changed accordingly.
   - A-line was placed for ABGs and BP monitoring
   - pt on pressor for hypotension, off pressor at 5:30am
   - Patient was going to be cooled to prevent reperfusion brain injury,

   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.
   #PEA:
   Hypovolemia, hypoxia, acidosis, potassium, glc, hypothermia
   Toxins, tamponade, tension pneumo, thrombosis, trauma
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: contributing factors include RML/RLL
   lung collapse, atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, and
   pain.  She was extubated on [**10-15**]. Due to little change after extensive
   diuresis and unilateral picture, most likely lung collapse.  CXR today
   shows greater right lung collapse.  Was only able to be placed on CPAP
   for brief period during the day.
   - pt. currently does not want to be re-intubated unless under dire
   circumstances.
   - discuss with patient necessity of a bronch to clear up secretions in
   lieu of her lung collapse
   - consider a-line placement vs. abg pending clinical status.
   - continue encouraging cough, deep breath, and inspiratory spirometer
   - flutter valve and chest PT to break up mucous plugging
   - consider MIE as outpt does not have good cough mechanism
   - continue Vit D and phosphate replacement
   - continue pain control on current regimen

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA and T2 paraplegia since 2142, admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient had a previous episode of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia.

During the code, the patient experienced bradycardia and pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and was successfully resuscitated with CPR, epinephrine, atropine, bicarb, insulin, and dextrose. After the code, the patient had difficulty maintaining airway patency, possibly due to a plugged central airway. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were initially hypertensive and tachycardic but later became hypotensive. An immediate bronchoscopy was performed, resulting in improvement in blood pressure and heart rate. The post-bronchoscopic electrocardiogram (EKG) showed inferior and anterolateral ischemia.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.46, indicating respiratory alkalosis. The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation (MV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 430 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

   - pt requested that she be re-intubated in the pm as she was more
   dyspneic on non-rebreather. anesthesiology came and intubated her. soon
   afterwards, patient had bradycardia and went into PEA, and pt was
   coded. Patient was resuscitated with CPR, 3 epi and 2 atropine, 1 amp
   bicarb, 5u insulin and 1amp dextrose. During the code, it was difficult
   to bag patient, indicating central airway was plugged. after about 4min
   pulse came back, patient was intially hypertensive with SBP in 170s,
   tachycardic at 150s with SVT, possibly AVNRT, she became hypotensive
   with SBP in the 80-90s as well. Patient was bronch'd immediately,
   copious secretions were suctioned, and post-bronch cxr showed part of
   the right lung re-opened up. Following bronch, BP and HR improved. EKG
   following bronch showed inferior ischemia (TWI in II, III, avF), and
   anterolateral ischemia (ST depression in V3-V6). CK: 28  MB: 4  Trop-T:

   #Hypotension: currently on phenylephrine.  Differential includes
   decreased volume status, sepsis, or cardiac.  WBC has increased with
   fevers.  CVP is 14.  She does have hx of cardiac injury.
   - switch to levaphed
   - monitor CVP levels for need of IVF
   - f/u with bld, urine, sputum cx
   - cont with current abx regimen.
   - replace a-line to check for accurate measurements
   .
   #Mild metabolic alkalosis: Most likely due to contraction alkalosis.
   - check urine lytes (Cl)
   - check CVP for volume status and bolus with IVF if volume depleted
   .
   # Anemia:  chronic normocytic anemia, with baseline hct in the 25-30
   range.  Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding.
   B12, iron, folate studies wnl. Hct dropped today.
   - continue to monitor Hct

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest during the night and was resuscitated. She had difficulty bagging with copious secretions, indicating central airway obstruction. After bronchoscopy, her blood pressure and heart rate improved, and an inferior ischemia was noted on the EKG.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been intubated multiple times. Her sputum culture showed pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag +. Vancomycin was added to her antibiotic regimen due to her history of staph aureus infection. The patient's WBC count has increased, indicating an infection.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure in the range of 110/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her current weight is 62 kg.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and low glucose levels. Her troponin T levels peaked at 0.13 and are trending down. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia, intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia, admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. She experienced bradycardia and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during intubation, was resuscitated with CPR, and had an episode of hypoxia due to copious secretions. The patient has agreed to undergo tracheostomy and has shown improvement in her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory failure and lung collapse may lead to inadequate oxygenation.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and increased white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. The sputum culture results indicate contamination with upper respiratory secretions, so another specimen should be obtained. The patient also has pneumonia and is at risk for further infections.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of cardiac injury, and the ECG showed inferior and anterolateral ischemia. Troponin levels were elevated, indicating possible myocardial damage.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline Hct in the 25-30 range. The recent drop in Hct needs monitoring.
5. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels need to be addressed and monitored.

   pulse came back, patient was intially hypertensive with SBP in 170s,
   tachycardic at 150s with SVT, possibly AVNRT, she became hypotensive
   with SBP in the 80-90s as well. Patient was bronch'd immediately,
   copious secretions were suctioned, and post-bronch cxr showed part of
   the right lung re-opened up. Following bronch, BP and HR improved. EKG
   following bronch showed inferior ischemia (TWI in II, III, avF), and
   anterolateral ischemia (ST depression in V3-V6). CK: 28  MB: 4  Trop-T:

   - ABG was obtained post-code and vent setting was changed accordingly.
   - A-line was placed for ABGs and BP monitoring
   - pt on pressor for hypotension, off pressor at 5:30am
   - Patient was going to be cooled to prevent reperfusion brain injury,
   but pt woke up and was following commands, so cooling was held

   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.
   #PEA: Differential includes hypovolemia, hypoxia, acidosis,
   hyper/hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, toxins, tamponade,
   tension pneumo, thrombosis, trauma.  Seeing how bagging was difficult
   with copious secretions
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: contributing factors include RML/RLL
   lung collapse, atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, and
   pain.  She was extubated on [**10-15**]. Due to little change after extensive
   diuresis and unilateral picture, most likely lung collapse.  CXR today
   shows greater right lung collapse.  Was only able to be placed on CPAP
   for brief period during the day.
   - pt. currently does not want to be re-intubated unless under dire
   circumstances.
   - discuss with patient necessity of a bronch to clear up secretions in
   lieu of her lung collapse
   - consider a-line placement vs. abg pending clinical status.
   - continue encouraging cough, deep breath, and inspiratory spirometer
   - flutter valve and chest PT to break up mucous plugging
   - consider MIE as outpt does not have good cough mechanism
   - continue Vit D and phosphate replacement

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA and T2 paraplegia since 2142. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient had episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She underwent bronchoscopy, arterial line placement, and received antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin). The patient experienced bradycardia and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during intubation, requiring resuscitation with CPR, epinephrine, atropine, bicarb, insulin, and dextrose. Following the code, the patient's blood pressure and heart rate improved after bronchoscopic evacuation of secretions. An inferior ischemia and anterolateral ischemia were observed on the EKG, with elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, MB, Troponin-T). The patient's temperature is currently 38.9°C (102.0°F), and she has been receiving prophylactic heparin sodium.

Review of Systems:

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo female with respiratory failure complicated by PEA arrest at the
   time of re-intubation.  She has had rapid return to responsive state
   follwing arrest.  With ventilatory support overnight she has had
   improved oxygenation but retains mildly elevated Pplat and has
   persistent collapse
we have been able to move to acceptable ventilatory
   support levels.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Secondary to atelectasis, collapse, pulmonary
   infection and with T2 paraplegia and now with multiple rib fractures
   worsening chest wall compliance and capacity to clear secretions.
   -Continue A/C but will move to PSV today
   -Will continue with suction and send sputum sample for analysis
   -Vanco/Levo/Cefepime to continue given signficant fever, infiltrate and
   sepsis
   -Have discussed extensively with patient and her husband that given the
   need for continued close ventilatory support tracheostomy is indicated
   and will pursue with IP at this time.
   2)Hypotension-This is most clearly related to sepsis given fever, WBC
   count elevation and pulmonary opacities. Hypotension may be contributed
   to by hypovolemia in the setting of recent diuresis but this should
   have been resolved.  Myocardial stunning in the setting of arrest
   certainly can be seen and may be contributing as well.
   -Will keep to CVP of 12
   -Will move to levophed this morning for support of BP with sepsis and
   vasodilatory state most likely.
   3)Alkalemia
Mild Metabolic Alkalosis-
   -Will check urine chloride to evaluate further

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with respiratory failure, complicated by a PEA arrest during re-intubation. The patient has shown rapid recovery following the arrest. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support and has improved oxygenation but retains mildly elevated Pplat and persistent collapse in the right lower lobe and part of the right middle lobe.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to atelectasis, collapse, pulmonary infection, and now with multiple rib fractures worsening chest wall compliance and capacity to clear secretions.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most clearly related to sepsis given fever, WBC count elevation, and pulmonary opacities. Hypotension may be contributed to by hypovolemia in the setting of recent diuresis but should have been resolved. Myocardial stunning in the setting of arrest certainly can be seen and may be contributing as well.

3. Alkalemia: The patient has mild metabolic alkalosis, which will be further evaluated by checking urine chloride.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, blood pressure, and electrolyte balance. Appropriate measures should be taken to address these potential complications and provide optimal care for the patient."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, and she has shown some improvement but still requires ongoing treatment and monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team is following a VAP bundle to reduce this risk.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, are being taken to prevent this complication.

3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can also increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are being used to prevent this complication.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is being managed with vasopressors, currently levophed. This will need to be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary.

5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has mild metabolic alkalosis, likely due to contraction alkalosis. Further evaluation of urine electrolytes and volume status should be done to guide management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications, including hypoxia, pneumonia, sepsis, hypotension, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, and depression. She has been treated with various medications and interventions, including intubation, tracheostomy, and administration of antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's previous episodes of respiratory failure indicate a potential risk for recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of right upper lobe collapse, atelectasis, small pleural effusions, and positive sputum culture suggests a risk for pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, fevers, and positive blood cultures indicate a risk for sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure and use of vasopressors suggest a risk for continued hypotension.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's elevated bicarbonate levels indicate a risk for metabolic alkalosis.
6. Anemia: The patient's chronic normocytic anemia may worsen due to ongoing blood loss or decreased production.
7. Depression: The patient's history of depression requires ongoing management to prevent exacerbations"

   wean of ventilator and support of secretion clearance in the setting of
   weakness.  Tracheostomy now in place and will continue to move to wean
   ventilator and move to trach mask trial with PMV placement at earliest
   possible time.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This is secondary to recurrent airway collpase
   and opacification in the right lung most clearly.  We have worked with
   she and her husband in detail to move to plan in agreement with patient
   wishes.
   -Tracheostomy placed
   -Will move to trach mask trials as possible
   -Will move to have patient up and in chair as possible with
   paraplegia--this may be driven by bed positioning
   -Vanco/Levoflox/Cefepime
   -Will move to wean to PSV today when patient recovered from paralytics
   -Will continue with broad spectrum ABX
   -[**Month (only) 8**] need repeat bronchoscopy
   2)PEA arrest/Hypotension-
   -Has been weaned off of pressors

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with T2 paraplegia who requires a tracheostomy for safe weaning of the ventilator and support of secretion clearance. She has respiratory failure due to recurrent airway collapse and opacification in the right lung. She also has a history of pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), anxiety, alteration in nutrition, hypoxemia, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off pressors. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and her tracheostomy is in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to recurrent airway collapse and opacification in the right lung. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. PEA Arrest/Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension controlled with norepinephrine yesterday. This could indicate underlying cardiovascular instability or sepsis, which may lead to further episodes of hypotension and potential cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, UTI, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. There is a risk of developing new infections or the progression of existing infections, especially since she is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. Anxiety and Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has a documented history of anxiety and alteration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, and she has been placed on mechanical ventilation. She underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy and is currently on a combination of antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheter use increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin have been initiated.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged bed rest. Prophylactic stress ulcer precautions have been taken.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, decreased volume status, or cardiac dysfunction. Levophed has been started to maintain blood pressure.
5. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory failure and lung collapse put her at risk for ongoing hypoxia. Close monitoring and bronchoscopy have been performed.
6. Infection: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions. The note mentions the following:

1. Performed percutaneous tracheostomy at 11:31 AM on [**2147-10-20**].
2. The patient has no known drug allergies.
3. The patient has received antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime.
4. The patient is receiving various medications such as lorazepam (Ativan), carafate (sucralfate), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).
5. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/74 mmHg to 160/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
6. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
7. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 308, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 276.
8. The patient's physical examination findings are incomplete, including peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment.
9. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 170 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 116 mg/dL, low sodium level of 22 mEq/L, normal potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, and low albumin level of 2.8 g/dL.
10. The patient's imaging studies are not provided in the note.

Based on this information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Nosocomial urinary tract infection (UTI) due to catheterization.
4. Anxiety and delirium due to the patient's ICU stay and various interventions.
5. Hypoxemia and respiratory distress due to underlying lung conditions such as pneumonia.
6. Sepsis without organ dysfunction, potentially secondary to UTI or pneumonia.

These are just potential complications based on the information provided, and a comprehensive assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the exact medical complications and appropriate interventions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, effusions, and respiratory failure. The patient is being weaned off the ventilator and will continue receiving 72 hours of antibiotics. Additionally, the patient has completed a course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. The patient also has hypotension, which has been resolved, and paraplegia, for which the current treatment regimen will be continued. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 105/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance is slightly negative, with a total input of 1,347 mL and total output of 1,535 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including lansoprazole, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and lorazepam. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's diagnosis of pneumonia indicates an existing infection in the lungs. If left untreated or inadequately treated, the pneumonia can worsen, leading to respiratory distress or other complications.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to complications such as respiratory distress, sepsis, and multi-organ failure if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (PSV mode) with a tracheostomy tube in place. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury if the respiratory support is not adjusted appropriately.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although the patient has completed the course of antibiotics for the UTI, there is still a risk of persistent infection or reinfection. This can potentially lead to sepsis or kidney complications if not adequately managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient has shown episodes of hypotension, which may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and end-organ damage. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure are crucial to prevent further complications.
5. Paraplegia: The patient's paraplegia could be due to spinal cord injury or other neurological conditions. Proper nursing care and prevention of pressure ulcers, deep vein thromb"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction. He has a history of pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving oxygen through a tracheostomy tube. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/63 mmHg to 143/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has been receiving various medications including levofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime, lansoprazole, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection and regular chest X-rays may be necessary.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and use of central lines can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin may be initiated to prevent this complication.

3. Stress ulcer: The patient's use of corticosteroids and critical illness puts"

   Disposition: ICU:
","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions including T2 paraplegia, depression, and chronic normocytic anemia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 105/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 343 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 52.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, for which she has been started on antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Her sputum culture showed pan-sensitive klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus coag +, so vancomycin was added due to her history of Staphylococcus aureus infection. Cefepime was added to include broader coverage (pseudomonas). The patient's white blood cell count has increased, indicating a possible infection.

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive fluid balance of 188 mL since 12 AM. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg. The patient's blood cultures are pending, as well as her urine culture and sputum culture. The patient's troponin level peaked at 0.13 and is trending down.

The patient's respiratory failure is a concern, with contributing factors including right lower lobe lung collapse, atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, and pain. She was reintubated on October 18th and underwent bronchoscopy, which showed some right upper lobe opening. She was tracheostomized on October 20th and placed on assist-control ventilation (AC 430/12). Currently, she is being weaned off mechanical ventilation and is on pressure support (PS) of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's hypotension may be due to decreased volume status, sepsis, or cardiac causes. Her CVP is 13, indicating some degree of fluid volume. She has a history of cardiac injury.

The patient's metabolic alkalosis has resolved with IV fluids. She has chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) in the 25-30 range. Her vitamin B12, iron, and folate levels are within normal limits.

The patient's T2 paraplegia requires continued management with pain medications including baclofen, methadone, and lyrica. Her bowel regimen and depression management with Celexa 40mg will also continue.

The patient's hypokalemia is stable, and her potassium levels should be repleted. Her renal function should be monitored.

In summary, the patient's current conditions include pneumonia, respiratory failure, hypotension, hypoxia, and hypokalemia. She is being treated with antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and fluid management. The patient's prognosis and potential complications depend on the resolution of her pneumonia, improvement in respiratory function, and management of her other medical conditions."

   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**2142**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia admitted with fever,
   hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.
   #PEA: Differential includes hypovolemia, hypoxia, acidosis,
   hyper/hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, toxins, tamponade,
   tension pneumo, thrombosis, trauma.  In lieu of difficulty bagging with
   copious secretions, most likely cause is hypoxia.  [**Last Name (un) 524**]/ sputum cx
   were sent.  Patient has agreed to trach in the setting of numerous
   failed extubations. Vanc was added to her regimen. Her WBC has bumped
   up to 22.8.  ECG showed some ischemic changes.  Trops peaked at .13 and
   is trending down.
   # Hypoxia and respiratory failure: contributing factors include RLL
   lung collapse, atelectasis, small pleural effusions, pneumonia, and
   pain.  She was re-intubated on [**10-18**]. After bronch, CXR showed some
   right upper lobe opening. She was Trach-ed on [**2147-10-20**] and was put on
   A/C 430/12. Currently back on PS.
   - wean to PS 5/5
   - f/u with bronch/sputum cx
   - cont with suctioning secretions
   - continue pain control on current regimen

   # Pneumonia: afebrile overnight.  Her sputum cx grew pan-sensitive
   klebsiella and staph aureus coag +.  Vanc was added due to her hx of
   staph aureus. Cefepime was added to include broader coverage
   (pseudomonas)
   - recheck sputum cx
   - d/c vanc, levo, cefepime -> cultures are neg for >72 hrs
   - maintain cvl
   .
   #Hypotension: off pressors for >24 hrs.  Differential includes
   decreased volume status, sepsis, or cardiac.  WBC has increased with
   fevers.  CVP is 13.  She does have hx of cardiac injury.
   - monitor CVP levels for need of IVF; goal of [**9-11**].
   - f/u with bld, urine, sputum cx
   .
   #Mild metabolic alkalosis: Most likely due to contraction alkalosis.
   Resolved with IVF.
   - check CVP for volume status and bolus with IVF if volume depleted
   .
   # Anemia:  chronic normocytic anemia, with baseline hct in the 25-30
   range.  Hemodynamically stable with no obvious sources of bleeding.
   B12, iron, folate studies wnl.
   - continue to monitor Hct

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/77 mmHg to 133/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her weight is currently 62 kg, and her height is 65 inches. 

The patient is receiving various medications including lorazepam, pain control medications, trazodone, clonazepam, and citalopram. She is also receiving a pulmonary formula through a feeding tube at 40 mL/hour. 

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxia and respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypotension, anemia, T2 paraplegia, depression, and hypokalemia. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers due to her prolonged ICU stay and mechanical ventilation. 

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable at the moment, with ongoing monitoring and management of her various medical complications."

","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of T2 paraplegia. She has been hospitalized for Klebsiella pneumonia and is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient is on minimal pressure support ventilation (PSV) support and shows good ventilation, respiratory rate, and alertness. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/69 mmHg to 136/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Her fluid balance shows a total input of 2,179 mL and a total output of 2,675 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -496 mL. 

The patient is receiving various medications, including lorazepam, lansoprazole, and antibiotics such as levofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. 

Her lab results show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. However, her sodium, potassium, and chloride levels are slightly low, while her bicarbonate level is within the normal range. Her blood glucose level is within normal limits. 

Her imaging studies include a chest X-ray taken on 10/20/2147 at 05:42 AM, which showed infiltrates in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia.

   51 yo female with T2 paraplegia and hospital course complicated by
   recurrent respiratory failure with need for tracheostomy and now able
   to tolerate wean in PSV support with brief trial on trach mask with
   PMV.  She has persistent improvement in hemodynamic stability.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Limited by rapid shallow breathing that evolves
   with pressure support discontinued-this would appear to be related to
   chest wall issues with rib fractures, T2 level compromise and possible
   persistent atelectasis.
   -Will move to trach mask trials
   -OOB to chair
   -Continued move to rehab placement
   Additional issues to be addressed as deinfed in the housestaff note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of T2 paraplegia. She has been admitted to the ICU with recurrent respiratory failure and is currently on tracheostomy support. The patient has shown improvement in hemodynamic stability and is able to tolerate weaning in PSV support with brief trials on a trach mask with PMV. The patient's chest x-ray shows good positioning of the PICC line and improved aeration in the bases bilaterally.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's limited respiratory function may lead to further respiratory failure, particularly when pressure support is discontinued.
2. Chest Wall Issues: Rib fractures, T2 level compromise, and possible persistent atelectasis may contribute to the patient's respiratory difficulties.
3. Impaired Aerobic Capacity/Endurance: The patient's impaired respiratory function may result in reduced aerobic capacity and endurance.
4. Impaired Balance: The patient's neurological condition and immobilization may lead to impaired balance.
5. Impaired Respiration/Gas Exchange: The patient's respiratory issues may affect her ability to exchange gases effectively.
6. Impaired Transfers: Due to her respiratory failure and other impairments, the patient may have difficulty with transfers.
7. Impaired Ventilation: The patient's compromised respiratory function may result in inadequate ventilation.
8. Impaired Knowledge: The patient's neurological condition may impair her cognitive abilities and knowledge.
9. Pain Control: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia, intermittent respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia, and current admission with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. She has undergone tracheostomy and is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 40%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 115/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is alert and in moderate distress. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right lung with fine crackles, soft non-tender abdomen, and no edema in extremities.

Medical history includes hypoxia and respiratory failure, pneumonia, tracheostomy, and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for the pneumonia, which grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus coag +. She is currently off all antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of MVA/T2 paraplegia and intermittent episodes of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2147-10-18**] and has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, and central venous line placement. She has been on mechanical ventilation support and has shown some improvement in her respiratory status. The patient's current condition is stable, with ongoing management of her pneumonia, hypotension, anemia, T2 paraplegia, depression, and hypokalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation indicates a risk of recurrent respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to prevent complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture showed pan-sensitive klebsiella and staph aureus coag +. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance and recurrence of pneumonia. Regular monitoring of lung sounds and sputum cultures will be important to prevent further infections.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to decreased volume status, sepsis, or cardiac issues. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo female with admission with persistent respiratory failure with
   aspiration, in ability to clear secretions and persistent atelectasis
   and collapse requiring tracheostomy and now with chronic ventilatory
   support required  with frequent suctioning.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This was a picture of pneumonia but then with
   significant right sided lung involvement and collapse patient was
   unable to effectively clear secretions.  This required intubation
   compliacted by PEA arrest.  After extensive discussions with patient
   and her husband and in response to significant and persistent risk for
   recurrent obstruction and to allow more systematic weaning from the
   ventilator tracheostomy was clearly required. At this point patient
   appears to be limited in regards to capacity to wean from ventilator
   support primarily due to weakness, secretions rather than persistent
   infection or volume overload.
   -Wean PSV as tolerated
   -PMV teaching completed and patient with good experience with this from
   past as well
   -Trach mask trials as tolerated
   2)Aspiration-
   -Will remain NPO
   -Tube feeds for now
   -Will have to consider G-tube if move to po intake without success

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been admitted with persistent respiratory failure due to aspiration, inability to clear secretions, and persistent atelectasis requiring tracheostomy and chronic ventilatory support.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/69 mmHg to 138/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 371 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 105. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is set at 16 cmH2O.

The patient has several medical conditions, including pneumonia, aspiration, chronic ventilatory support, and potential complications such as respiratory failure, hypotension, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, impaired knowledge, pain control (acute and chronic), anxiety, alteration in nutrition, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine,"
