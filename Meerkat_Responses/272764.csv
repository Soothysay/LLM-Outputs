   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 107**] [**Known lastname 805**] is a 51 yo gentleman with Down syndrome, chronic Hep
   B, and frequent UTIs since undergoing posterior cervical laminectomy
   earlier this month.  He presents with mental status changes, fever,
   hypotension and a urinary tract infection.  By problems:
   #sepsis/ Change in MS -   Source most likely to be from urinary tract
   given urine dip and hx of frequent URI.  CXR also shows area of
   possible infiltrate vs. atelectasis.
   -Obtain sputum cx.  Defer LP for now as consider meningitis as lower on
   differential.
   -Treat empirically with vanco and cefipime per ID recommendation.
   review doses given altering renal function.
   -Obtain central line and follow CVP with goal of CVP of [**11-18**].
   -D/C femoral line after central line access is obtained.
   -Monitor MAP with goal of MAP >55 given patient
s SBP normally runs in
   90s
   -Wean off pressors
 goal to d/c phenylepinephine before levofed.
   # Acute Renal Failure -  Creatinine bumped to 2.7 previously ranged 0.7
   to 1.0.
   - pre-renal element BUN: Cr >20
   - Urine output
 high considering patient
s volume status.
   - Renally dose medications
   - IV fluids
 NS boluses as needed.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   -Obtain renal ultrasound to r/o obstruction as well as source for
   repeated infections.
   #Respiratory acidosis/ apneic breathing
 resolving with respiratory
   acidosis.  But still tachypneic.  patient is DNR/DNI.
   # Hep B (chronic)
   - on adefovir and lamivudine chronically
 hold until renal function
   improves.
   # DVT prophylaxis - Pneumatic boots & Hep SQ renally dosed.
   # Nutrition
 patient is NPO.
   # Stress Ulcer prophylaxis - Famotidine at renal dosage.
   # CODE STATUS - DNR/DNI - confirmed with sister.
   # Family contact information - Sister is health care proxy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with Down syndrome, chronic Hepatitis B, and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) since undergoing a posterior cervical laminectomy earlier this month. He presents with mental status changes, fever, hypotension, and a urinary tract infection. The source of sepsis is likely from the urinary tract, considering the urine dip and history of frequent UTIs. The patient also has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, respiratory acidosis, and chronic Hepatitis B. He is DNR/DNI and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have significantly increased from 0.7-1.0 to 2.7, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to factors such as decreased renal perfusion, infection, or nephrotoxins.
3. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient is experiencing respiratory acidosis, which is a condition where there is an excessive amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood due to inadequate breathing.
4. Hepatitis B: The patient has chronic Hepatitis B, which is a viral infection that affects the liver. It can lead to complications such as cirrhosis, liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and cefepime. Vital signs show an elevated temperature of 38.6Â°C (101.4Â°F) and a heart rate of 96 beats per minute. Blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods, later identified as Proteus mirabilis. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.0 K/uL and an elevated lactate level of 2.5 mmol/L. Imaging reveals no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal stones. The patient's current condition remains unchanged, with ongoing respiratory support and multiple IV lines in place. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for new or worsening respiratory symptoms, such as increased sputum production, worsening oxygenation, or changes in mental status, should be closely monitored.
2. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): Given the Foley catheter in place, there is a risk of developing a urinary tract infection. Signs of CAUTI may include fever, dysuria, increased urinary frequency or urgency, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old gentleman with Down syndrome, chronic Hep B, and frequent UTIs since undergoing posterior cervical laminectomy earlier this month. He presents with mental status changes, fever, hypotension, and a urinary tract infection. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute renal failure, respiratory acidosis, chronic Hep B, and potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently on life support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing systemic inflammation and infection, which can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have significantly increased, indicating impaired kidney function. This may be due to sepsis or other underlying causes.
3. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's breathing pattern is causing respiratory acidosis, which can be life-threatening if not corrected.
4. Chronic Hep B: Although not currently an acute issue, the patient's chronic Hep B infection may contribute to his overall health complications and require ongoing management.
5. Potential DVT: The patient may be at risk for developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism if not prevented or treated promptly.
6. Infection Control: Given the patient's frequent UTIs and current urinary tract infection, there is a need for strict infection control measures"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with Down syndrome, chronic Hepatitis B, and a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) following a posterior cervical laminectomy this month. He presents with mental status changes, fever, hypotension, and a urinary tract infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/63 mmHg to 122/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, and Cefepime. He is also on norepinephrine infusion, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection, and his presentation with fever, hypotension, and mental status changes suggests sepsis. The source of infection is most likely from the urinary tract given the culture data.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had an episode of acute renal failure, but it has resolved with a current creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.
3. Chronic Hepatitis B: The patient has chronic Hepatitis B, which requires ongoing monitoring and management.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with Down syndrome, chronic Hepatitis B, and a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) since undergoing posterior cervical laminectomy with Foley catheter placement earlier this month. He presents with Gram-negative bacterial septic shock, and his blood cultures have grown pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis in the urinary catheter, as well as pan-sensitive Gram-negative rods in the blood cultures.

The patient is currently being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and cefepime. The plan is to continue the antibiotic treatment for a 14-day course. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 55-60, considering the patient's baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) usually runs in the 90s. Adequate urine output (UOP) is being maintained at this blood pressure, and the Levophed infusion has been turned off. The femoral line will be discontinued once the patient is off pressors.

The patient is experiencing GU pain but has adequate UOP and no evidence of obstruction. Lidocaine jelly has been applied at the meatus, and oxycodone will be given as needed. If there is no relief, phenazopyridine may be tried.

The patient is also showing signs of acute renal failure, with pre-renal physiology versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The creatinine level has normalized at 0.9. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed when the patient is off pressors to evaluate for structural heart disease.

The patient has chronic Hepatitis B, and the usual doses of adefovir and lamivudine have been restarted. Preoperative medical clearance has been obtained for possible upcoming surgeries.

The patient is tolerating a regular diet with adequate oral intake and is repleted in potassium. Intravenous fluids are being given at keep-open (KVO), and a normal saline bolus may be given if the patient becomes hypotensive following discontinuation of Levophed.

The patient has a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and will have the femoral line discontinued once off pressors. Midline placement for intravenous antibiotic therapy will be evaluated.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), confirmed with the sister who is also the healthcare proxy. The patient will remain in the ICU as long as pressor requirements remain, followed by transfer to the floor."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with Down syndrome, chronic Hepatitis B, and a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). He underwent a posterior cervical laminectomy with Foley catheter placement earlier this month and is currently experiencing gram-negative bacterial septic shock. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/63 mmHg to 77/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and awake but uncomfortable. Physical examination reveals pedal edema and no cyanosis.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, increased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. Blood cultures have grown pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis and gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient has been receiving various antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and cefepime. His MAP goal is above 55-60, and he is being weaned off levophed with fluid boluses. The femoral line will be discontinued once off pressors. The patient is also experiencing GU pain, which is being managed with lidocaine and oxycodone. There is a concern for acute renal failure, but the creatinine level has normalized at 0.9. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with Down syndrome, chronic Hepatitis B, and a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) since undergoing a posterior cervical laminectomy and foley catheter placement earlier this month. The patient is currently experiencing septic shock caused by a Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacterium, specifically pan-sensitive Proteus mirabilis in the urine culture and blood cultures grown with pan-sensitive GNR. The patient's vital signs show a fever (Tmax: 37.9Â°C), elevated heart rate (91 bpm), low blood pressure (99/63 mmHg), normal respiratory rate (11 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support and has been treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and cefepime antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued septic shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced urine output. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent acute renal failure.
3. Hepatitis B: The patient has chronic Hepatitis B, which requires ongoing monitoring and management to prevent disease progression.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with Down syndrome, chronic Hepatitis B, and a history of frequent urinary tract infections since undergoing posterior cervical laminectomy with Foley catheter placement earlier this month. He presents with septic shock caused by pan-sensitive Pseudomonas mirabilis in urine cultures, and blood cultures grew pan-sensitive Gram-negative rods. The patient is currently on cefepime (day 3), which will be continued, and oral ciprofloxacin will be initiated prior to discharge. The goal is to treat for an 8-day course. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be maintained above 55-60 due to his baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) running in the 90s. Adequate urine output (UOP) is being maintained at this blood pressure, and weaning of levophed may be considered, along with giving fluid boluses to maintain MAP. Once off pressors, the femoral line will be discontinued.

The patient is experiencing GU pain but has adequate UOP and no signs of obstruction. Lidocaine jet at the meatus, oxycodone as needed, and possibly phenazopyridine will be considered if there is no relief.

There is a concern for acute renal failure, with pre-renal physiology versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Creatinine levels have normalized at 0.9.

The patient has Down syndrome, and a transthoracic echo"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with Down syndrome, chronic Hepatitis B, and a history of frequent urinary tract infections since undergoing posterior cervical laminectomy with Foley catheter placement earlier this month. He presented with gram-negative bacillus septic shock. The patient is currently being treated for a 8-20 day course of antibiotics (Cipro for PO and Cefepime for IV). His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 84/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and various medications for his medical conditions. The patient has acute renal failure, systolic dysfunction with pulmonary hypertension, chronic Hepatitis B, and is not expected to undergo active resuscitation (DNR/DNI). He is tolerating a regular diet and is expected to be transferred to the floor once his pressor requirement is no longer needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with gram-negative bacillus septic shock. It is important to closely monitor his vital signs, blood cultures, and response to antibiotics.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has pre-renal physiology vs. acute tubular necrosis. Regular monitoring of renal function parameters such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with Down syndrome, chronic Hepatitis B, and frequent urinary tract infections since undergoing posterior cervical laminectomy with Foley catheter placement earlier this month. He is currently being treated for gram-negative bacillus (GNR) septic shock, with pan-sensitive Pseudomonas mirabilis identified in urine cultures and blood cultures growing pan-sensitive GNR. The patient is on cefepime (day 4) and will have a change to ciprofloxacin for oral administration prior to discharge. He is also receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 73-105 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 72/40 to 84/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is 79.6 kg, and height is 61 inches.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and awake but uncomfortable. His cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm and normal S1 and S2 sounds without any murmurs or extra heart sounds. Pulmonary examination indicates decreased breath sounds with poor inspiratory effort but no wheezing or rales. Abdominal examination shows no tenderness or guarding, and extremities reveal pedal edema without cyanosis.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with Down syndrome, chronic Hepatitis B, and a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). He underwent posterior cervical laminectomy with Foley catheter placement earlier this month and is currently in the ICU for septic shock caused by pan-sensitive Pseudomonas mirabilis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/40 mmHg to 72/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, cefepime, heparin sodium, and adefovir and lamivudine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient has already experienced septic shock due to a GNR infection. There is a risk of further complications or recurrence if proper antibiotic therapy and infection control measures are not maintained.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is currently normal with a creatinine level of 0.9. However, there is a possibility of acute renal failure due to pre-renal physiology or acute tubular necrosis (ATN), especially in the setting of shock.
3. Systolic Dysfunction/Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has"

He underwent a posterior cervical laminectomy with Foley catheter placement earlier this month and is currently admitted to the ICU due to gram-negative bacillus (GNB) septic shock. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72/40 mmHg to 123/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination shows alertness, discomfort, poor inspiratory effort, pedal edema, and no cyanosis. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (22.0 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (10.8 g/dL), decreased platelet count (58 K/uL), and elevated creatinine (1.7 mg/dL). The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and cefepime.
