","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented to the hospital with back pain and was found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed. The patient underwent embolization by interventional radiology. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, and a decreased hematocrit level. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/52 to 155/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is on multiple medications including amiodarone, lisinopril, lasix, vitamin D, calcium carbonate, ferrous sulfate, and carbidopa. The patient has a small pleural effusion and bilateral effusions on imaging. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with abnormal coagulation profile and electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and there is suspicion of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's current assessment and plan include managing the retroperitoneal bleed, fever, atrial fibrillation, dementia/parkinsonism, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's history of a large retroperitoneal bleed and ongoing risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy puts him at risk for further"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 75F who was recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation s/p
   cardioversion on [**11-6**] who was discharged [**11-9**] on coumadin with a
   lovenox bridge who presented today from nursing home with back pain for
   the last 3 days.  CT abdomen who significant for large RP bleed.
   RP Bleed - Spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of new
   coumadin/lovenox use for atrial fibrillation.  Initial INR 2.1, got 2
   units FFP and 10mg IV Vitamin K.
   Arterial bleed from R lumbar branch s/p IR-guided embolization.
   - q4h HCT
   - Hold coumadin, lovenox and ASA
   - Would recommend against restarting coumadin as patient is also a
   significant fall risk [**2-16**] orthostatic hypotension, in addition to this
   bleed
   - NPO for now
   - active T&S
   - Transfuse for HCT<25
   Hypertension - Currently hypertensive.  Son states that he suping BP's
   often run greater than 200.  However, patient has significant
   orthostatic hypotension.
   - Will hold BBlocker in setting of bleed
   - Ace in am
   - IV hydral overnight if SBP>160
   Dementia/[**Name (NI) 9092**] - Pt does have history of sundowning.
   - Continue Cinemet
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize line and tubes
   Anxiety - Pt has history of significant anxiety.  Pt takes stivan at
   least 3 times at baseline.  Has not been known to have paradoxical
   reaction per her family,
   - Continue judicious use of ativan.
   Atrial Fibrillation - Discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-9**] following
   cardioversion.  Put on coumadin with lovenox bridge.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold coumadin and lovenox indefinitely
   - Would recommend against restarting coumadin as patient is also a
   significant fall risk [**2-16**] orthostatic hypotension, in addition to this
   bleed
   Diarrhea - Pt had 2 ipisodes of loose stools upon arriving to the
   hospital.  Low grade temos and white count could be attributable to RP
   bleed, however, given recent hospitalization and nursing home stay,
   will rule out infectious etiologies as well.
   - send stool cultures
   Depression - Continue sertraline, currenlty on a dose escalation, due
   to increase from 12.5 to 25mg daily on [**11-15**]
   FEN - NPO overnight, replete lytes prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who underwent cardioversion and was discharged on coumadin with a lovenox bridge. She presented with back pain and was found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed on CT abdomen. The patient has been experiencing spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding in the setting of new coumadin/lovenox use for atrial fibrillation. Initial INR was 2.1, and she received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 10mg IV vitamin K. An arterial bleed from the right lumbar branch was identified and underwent IR-guided embolization. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/52-155/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Physical examination revealed no acute distress, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6-10.9 K/uL, hematocrit of 19.3-26.1%, platelet count of 224-208 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9-1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 111-104 mg/dL, and other labs within normal range. The assessment and plan include management of the retroperitoneal bleed, hypertension, dementia, anxiety, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, depression, and nutritional support. The patient is currently in the ICU with an anticipated total time spent of 35 minutes. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the retroperitoneal bleed, uncontrolled hypertension, exacerbation of dementia symptoms, anxiety, atrial fibrillation, infectious causes of diarrhea, and inadequate glycemic control."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, dementia, hypertension, and anxiety. He presented to the hospital with back pain and was found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed secondary to anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent embolization of the bleed and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight. His hemoglobin concentration improved from 19.5 to 26.1. The patient also experienced sundowning and had an arterial bleed from the right lumbar branch, which was managed with intravenous vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 38.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 124/52 to 155/96 mmHg, heart rate between 81 and 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Physical examination revealed no acute distress, surgical pupils, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and absent lower extremity edema. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, but normal hemoglobin, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. Imaging revealed a small pleural effusion and bilateral lung effusions. Microbiology cultures were pending, including C. difficile toxin. The patient's medical conditions included acute onset of atrial fibrillation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, dementia, and Parkinson's disease. He presented to the hospital with back pain and was found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed, which was successfully embolized by interventional radiology. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's low-grade temperature and white blood cell count could indicate an infection. Blood and urine cultures have been sent to rule out any infectious etiology.
2. Bleeding: The patient has had a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. This highlights the risk of bleeding complications due to anticoagulant therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 124/52 mmHg to 155/96 mmHg. This may indicate potential hypotension and the need for appropriate management.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 21 breaths per minute. Additionally, there are diminished breath sounds at the bases of the lungs. These findings suggest a potential respiratory problem that should be closely monitored.
5. Kidney function: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.0 mg/dL, which may indicate compromised kidney function. Regular monitoring of renal parameters is necessary.

 found to
   have large RP bleed s/p embolization by IR.  Now with worsening
   respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates/effusions.
   #Hypoxemia
 Likely due to volume overload from multiple blood products
   and IVF resuccitation.  Must also consider TRALI, ACS, or pneumonia
   (given fevers on presentation)
   - Diuresis, goal 1L negative
   - Consider BiPap if decompensates
   - R/O ACS (enzymes, EKG), consider TTE in am if positive
   - Add antibiotics if does not improve with diuresis or if signs of
   infection develop (fever, elevated WBC count, cough/sputum, etc)
   # RP Bleed - Spontaneous in the setting of anticoagulation for atrial
   fibrillation.  Found to have arterial bleed from R lumbar branch s/p
   IR-guided embolization. Hct slowly trending down.
   - Serial Hcts, goal >24 (If not emergent, will wait until respiratory
   status more stable to transfuse
 maybe in am)
   - Hold coumadin, lovenox and ASA
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-9**] following
   cardioversion.  Put on coumadin with lovenox bridge.
   - Continue amiodarone and BB
   - On ACE for hypertension.
   - Hold coumadin and lovenox indefinitely given RP bleed
   # Dementia/Parkinson's - History of sundowning.  H/o depression/anxiety

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2956**], whose note reflects my
   input.  Return to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxemia.  Has had
   waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] of alertness.  Although a few hours ago was
   unarousable, now alert, answering questions, oriented x 3, and can

 forward and backward.
   75 y/o woman initially admitted with RP bleed while anticoagulated,
   treated with embolization.  Went to floor and returns with respiratory
   distress and radiographic infiltrates but neither fever nor
   leucocytosis.  Oxygenation has improved with time and diuresis.
   Differential includes fluid overload (TACO) and acute lung injury
   (TRALI).  Bacterial pneumonia seems less likely given clinical picture,
   and we will therefore hold off on antibiotics.  Acute coronary syndrome
   seems less likely given reassuring cardiogram, but will check enzymes.
   For RP bleed, will hold anticoagulation and follow Hcts.  If needed,
   transfuse but carefully.  Can re-discuss anticoagulation with patient,
   family, and usual care providers once acute phase has passed.
   For altered mental status: if episodes of apparent obtundation persist,
   would consider EEG to exclude non-convulsive seizure disorder.  Rapid
   improvement argues that this is unlikely to be related to her chronic
   benzodiazepine use.
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2956**].
   Discussed with patient, husband, and family.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented with back pain and was found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed after embolization. She was initially treated in the ICU for the bleed and then transferred to the floor but returned with worsening respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates/effusions on chest X-ray.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in her blood, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.

2. Fluid overload/pulmonary edema: The bilateral infiltrates/effusions seen on the chest X-ray suggest fluid accumulation in the lungs, known as pulmonary edema. This can further worsen the patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia.

3. Acute lung injury (ALI) or Trauma-Related ARDS (TRALI): ALI and TRALI are both characterized by acute onset of hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates. TRALI is a subset of ALI that specifically occurs in critically ill patients, often in the setting of trauma or infection. The patient's clinical picture raises suspicion for either ALI or TRALI.

4. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Given the patient's age and presentation with respiratory distress, ACS should be considered and ruled out through appropriate investigations such as cardiac enzymes and an EKG"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old individual with a history of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation who underwent cardioversion. They presented with back pain and were found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed after embolization by interventional radiology. The patient was initially stable, but developed worsening respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates/effusions. 

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxemia likely due to volume overload from blood product transfusion and intravenous fluid resuscitation. Other possible causes such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pneumonia should also be considered. The plan involves diuresis to manage fluid overload, consideration of non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP), ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and adding antibiotics if there are signs of infection. 

The patient also has a history of spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, for which arterial embolization was performed. Serial hemoglobin checks are recommended, and the patient's anticoagulant medications (coumadin, lovenox, and ASA) should be held. 

Additionally, the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, dementia, and Parkinson's disease. They were discharged from another hospital on [**11-9**] after cardioversion and were started on amiodarone, beta-blocker, ACE"

   75 y/o with newly diagnosed afib s/p cardioversion [**11-6**] d/c on
   coumadin/lovenox.  Presented from NH with back pain x 3 days
 found to
   have large RP bleed s/p embolization by IR.  Now with worsening
   respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates/effusions.
   #Hypoxemia
 Likely due to volume overload from multiple blood products
   and IVF resuccitation.  Must also consider TRALI, ACS, or pneumonia
   (given fevers on presentation)
   - Diuresis, goal 1L negative
   - Consider BiPap if decompensates
   - R/O ACS (enzymes, EKG), consider TTE in am if positive
   - Add antibiotics if does not improve with diuresis or if signs of
   infection develop (fever, elevated WBC count, cough/sputum, etc)
   # RP Bleed - Spontaneous in the setting of anticoagulation for atrial
   fibrillation.  Found to have arterial bleed from R lumbar branch s/p
   IR-guided embolization. Hct slowly trending down.
   - Serial Hcts, goal >24 (If not emergent, will wait until respiratory
   status more stable to transfuse
 maybe in am)
   - Hold coumadin, lovenox and ASA
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-9**] following
   cardioversion.  Put on coumadin with lovenox bridge.
   - Continue amiodarone and BB
   - On ACE for hypertension.
   - Hold coumadin and lovenox indefinitely given RP bleed
   # Dementia/Parkinson's - History of sundowning.  H/o depression/anxiety
   as well.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old individual with a history of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation who underwent cardioversion. They were discharged on coumadin and lovenox. The patient presented with back pain for three days and was found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed following embolization by interventional radiology. The patient's condition worsened with increasing hypoxia, tachypnea, and bilateral infiltrates/effusions on chest X-ray. 

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxemia likely due to volume overload from multiple blood products and IV fluid resuscitation. Other potential causes to consider are transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pneumonia. The plan includes diuresis to remove excess fluid, consideration of non-invasive ventilation (BiPap) if necessary, ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with enzyme testing and electrocardiogram (EKG), and adding antibiotics if there are signs of infection.

The patient also has a history of spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, for which arterial embolization was performed. Serial hematocrit levels will be monitored, and the goal is to maintain a level above 24. Anticoagulation medications (coumadin, lovenox) and aspirin will be held.

Additionally, the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation"

   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Within the past 48 hours, pt has
   received 2 units of PRBCs and 4 units of FFP.  CXR shows worsening
   pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.  Climbing CO2 suggests that pt
   may be tiring soon.  Pt had low grade fever of 100.1 on admission but
   was afebrile on the floor.  [**Month (only) 8**] be hiding pneumonia behind her pleural
   effusion or retrocardiac space though initial CXR was clear.  Less
   likely ACS.  Somewhat far out to be TRALI.

   # Retroperitoneal Bleed:  This was spontaneous in the setting of new
   coumadin/lovenox use for atrial fibrillation.  She has received 2 units
   of PRBCs, 4 units of FFP, and 10 mg IV vitamin K.  She has underwent
   embolization and her HCT is now somewhat stable at 23.6.  Initial INR
   2.1, got 2 units FFP and 10mg IV Vitamin K.
   - active T&S
   - HCT q8 hrs
   - Transfuse for HCT<25 or hemodynamic instability
   - Hold coumadin, lovenox and ASA

   # Dementia/Parkinson's: Pt does have history of sundowning.
   Hypercapnia may be worsening mental status
   - Continue Cinemet
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize line and tubes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who underwent cardioversion and was discharged on Coumadin with a Lovenox bridge. She presented with back pain and was found to have a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed, which was treated with embolization. The patient is now experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, worsening pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition may worsen due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

The patient also has a history of dementia/parkinsonism, anxiety/depression, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for the retroperitoneal bleed. Her HCT is stable at 23.6. The initial INR was 2.1, and she received 2 units of FFP and 10 mg IV Vitamin K.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may progress, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The worsening pleural effusions and pulmonary ed"

   This is a 75 yof who was recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation
   s/p cardioversion on [**11-6**] who was discharged [**11-9**] on coumadin with a
   lovenox bridge who presented with back pain, found to have a
   spontaneous RP bleed, now s/p embolization transferred out to the
   floor, who was not transferred back to the ICU for respiratory
   distress..
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Likely [**2-16**] fluid overload as patient
   had received 2 units of PRBCs and 4 units of FFP over the past 2 days.
   CXR also shows worsening pleural effusions and pulmonary edema,
   consistent with fluid overload.   Patient has had >2L of urine output
   since yesterday and is breathing well on 2LNC.   Will continue diuresis
   and plan to call out to floor later today or tomorrow.
   - IV Lasix for I&O goal of -1 to -1.5 L
   # Retroperitoneal Bleed:  HCT has trended down slightly over the past
   two days from 26 to 22.  Plan to transfuse 1uPRBC.  Will give lasix
   with PRBC to prevent respiratory distress.
   - check HCT post transfusion then HCT q12 hours
   - Transfuse for HCT<25 or hemodynamic instability
   - cont to hold coumadin, lovenox and ASA
   - at this time patient not a candidate for anticoagulation.  Will start
   ASA 325mg daily once stable for stroke prevention with atrial
   fibrillation

The patient is a 75-year-old female with recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who underwent cardioversion on [**11-6**] and was discharged on [**11-9**] on coumadin with a lovenox bridge. She presented with back pain and was found to have a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed, which was embolized. The patient was transferred to the floor but returned to the ICU due to respiratory distress. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely caused by fluid overload, as evidenced by the worsening pleural effusions and pulmonary edema seen on the chest X-ray. The patient has had a significant amount of urine output since yesterday and is breathing well on 2 liters nasal cannula. Diuretics will be continued to manage fluid balance and prevent further respiratory distress.
2. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has trended down slightly over the past two days from 26 to 22. To address this, 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) will be transfused. Lasix will also be administered with the PRBC to prevent respiratory distress. HCT will be monitored post-transfusion and every 12 hours. Transfusion will be considered for HCT <25 or in case of hemodynamic instability.
3. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing episodes of diarrhea."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old individual with a history of atrial fibrillation, dementia, and Parkinson's disease. They presented to the hospital with back pain and were found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed after undergoing embolization by interventional radiology. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, with hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates/effusions observed on imaging. This is likely due to volume overload from multiple blood products and intravenous fluid resuscitation. Other possible causes for the respiratory distress include TRALI, ACS, or pneumonia. 

The patient's current medications include Lopressor, Zoloft, Amio, Lorazepam, Lisinopril, Vit D, Tums, Iron, and Carbelevodopa. They have no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 172/80 mmHg to 91/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normal cardiovascular examination, diminished breath sounds at the lung bases, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. Neurological examination was not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old individual with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression/anxiety. The patient was admitted to the ICU with back pain and found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed post embolization by interventional radiology. Since admission, the patient has experienced worsening respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates/effusions. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 172/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's neurological status is clear, but their peripheral pulses could not be assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Other lab values, including creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal limits. Imaging and microbiology reports are unremarkable.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels are likely due to volume overload from multiple blood products and intravenous fluids. The plan is to continue ongoing diuresis, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1 liter. Antibiotics will be added if hypoxia worsens or signs of infection develop.

2. RP Bleed: The patient experienced a spontaneous arterial bleed in the right lumbar branch, which was managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o with newly diagnosed afib s/p cardioversion [**11-6**] d/c
d on
   coumadin/lovenox.  Presented from NH with back pain x 3 days
 found to
   have large RP bleed s/p embolization by IR.  Now with worsening
   respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates/effusions.
   # Hypoxemia
 Likely due to volume overload from multiple blood
   products and IVF resuccitation.  Must also consider TRALI, ACS, or
   pneumonia (given fevers on presentation).  Improved with diuresis.
   - Ongoing diuresis, goal 1L negative
   - Add antibiotics if hypoxia worsens or signs of infection develop
   (fever, elevated WBC count, cough/sputum, etc)
   # RP Bleed - Spontaneous in the setting of anticoagulation for atrial
   fibrillation.  Found to have arterial bleed from R lumbar branch s/p
   IR-guided embolization. Hct slowly trending down.
   - Serial Hcts, goal >24
 Will get 1 unit PRBC today
   - Hold coumadin, lovenox and ASA
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-9**] following
   cardioversion.  Put on coumadin with lovenox bridge.
   - Continue amiodarone and BB
   - On ACE for hypertension.
   - Hold coumadin and lovenox indefinitely given RP bleed
   # Dementia/Parkinson's - History of sundowning.  H/o depression/anxiety
   as well.
   - Continue Cinemet / Sertraline
   - Decrease Ativan dose given somnolence
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize line and tubes

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression/anxiety. He presented with back pain and was found to have a large retroperitoneal bleed after embolization by interventional radiology. The patient is now experiencing worsening respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates/effusions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxemia: This is likely due to volume overload from multiple blood products and IV fluid resuscitation. It may also be considered as a possible case of Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), or pneumonia. Improved with diuresis, ongoing diuresis is recommended, and antibiotics should be added if hypoxia worsens or signs of infection develop.
2. RP Bleed: The patient has spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. The arterial bleed from the right lumbar branch was successfully embolized by interventional radiology. Serial Hcts are planned, aiming for a goal of >24, and one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) will be given today. Coumadin, lovenox, and ASA should be held.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was discharged from Hospital1 on 11-9 following cardioversion and put on coumadin with lo"
