   24 Hour Events:
   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 59 year old female with extensive PMH
   including A Fib on sotalol and coumadin, sick sinus s/p dual-chamber
   pacemaker, CVA who presented to the [**Location (un) 1415**] ED and was found to be
   hypoxic 60% RA and was consequently intubated. Unfortunately, there is
   no documentation of presenting vitals, presenting compliants or
   intubation procedure. EKG demonstrated ST elevation V1, V2 and patient
   was consequently transferred for STEMI. Prior to transfer patient
   received Ativan 2 g IV, Versed 2g, Dopamine drip, Lasix 40 mg IVP,
   Heparin bolus and drip, Aspirin 300 PR. Patient's vitals ranged from
   71-100/43-60, P 71-84, O2 sat 99% vent.
   .
   EKG prior to transfer 16:28 ST elevations normalized and demonstrated
   baseline repolorization changes from LVH. To eval hypotension patient
   had right heart cath which demonstrated normal/hyperdynamic cardiac
   output (see results below) and no suggestion of cardiogenic shock.
   Patient was admited to CCU for concern of sepsis. Per report patient
   had positive urine culture recently at [**Location (un) 1415**].  Due to extensive
   allergy history patient was given Gentamicin 450mg IV in cath lab.
   .
   Patient intubated and sedated, unable to provide history.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 SHOCK, OTHER
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 57 year old female with hx DM II, CAD s/p MI, AFib
   s/p [**Hospital 10260**] transferred from OSH for cardiac cath. Patient hypoxic
   requiring intubation prior to transfer.
   .
   # Urosepsis: Supported by elevated WBC, left shift and positive urine
   culture OSH (GRAM NEGATIVE BACILLI - suggesting E. Coli, Proteus,
   Enterobacter, Serratia). Right heart cath demonstrates hyperdynamic
   septic shock. Due to complicated allergy history patient received
   Gentamicin in cath lab. By early goal directed therapy patient has been
   adequately resuscitated based on PCWP 15. Patient's CXR suggests ARDS,
   but could also be pulmonary edema secondary to acute CHF.
   - continue gentamicin, patient receiving 450 mg IV for daily dosing.
   Day 1 [**2168-8-31**].
   - monitor creatinine closely and adjust gentamicin if needed
   - obtain peak and trough levels around the 4th dose of therapy
   - continue Levophed for BP support
   - PCWP adequate therefore no additional fluid resuscitation required
   - place a-line for BP monitoring
   - follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   .
   # Hypoxic respitory failure: Most likely secondary to ARDS. [**Month (only) 60**] also
   have compenent of pulmonary edema 2 acute diastolic failure
   - sedate with fentanyl/versed while on vent
   - ARDSnet vent settings
   - ECHO in am to eval cardiac function
   .
   # PUMP: R heart cath suggests hyperdynamic septic shock supported by
   elevated WBC and positive urine culture (see discussion of urosepsis
   above). Patient may have a complicated picture of congestive heart
   failure in setting of urosepsis. Prior ECHO [**2166**] by report normal EF.
   - ECHO in am
   - Patient received 40 mg IV Lasix OSH and currently demonstrates good
   output 200-300 cc/hr. No further diuresis, goal euvolemia.
   .
   # CORONARIES: No suggestion of ACS. Received ASA and heparin prior to
   transfer. CATH [**2164**] demonstrated 20% LMCA, 20-30% LAD, LCx 30% OM3, RCA
   minimal luminal irregularities to 30% distally.
   - trend troponin
   - daily EKGs
   - ECHO
   - Continue outpatient Aspirin 162 mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: AFib on sotalol and coumadin. Sick sinus syndrome s/p PPM EKG
   demonstrates A-paced rhythm.
   - Hold Sotalol in setting of hypotension
   - INR 2.8, hold coumadin tonight in cause of possible intervention
   - if no planned intervention coumadin should be re-started in am

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of extensive medical problems, including atrial fibrillation on sotalol and coumadin, sick sinus syndrome status post dual-chamber pacemaker, CVA, CAD with multiple myocardial infarctions, diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, hypertension, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and mild pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, shock, urosepsis, and possible ARDS. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure due to ARDS or pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure
- Urosepsis caused by a gram-negative bacillus infection, likely E. coli, Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia
- Septic shock with hyperdynamic cardiac output
- Hypotension requiring Levophed support
- Positive urine culture
- Elevated WBC count and left shift
- Normal/hyperdynamic cardiac output on right heart cath
- ECHO showing 55-60% ejection fraction
- CXR suggesting ARDS or pulmonary edema

Assessment and Plan:
- Continue gentamicin for urosepsis
- Monitor creatinine and adjust gentamicin dosage if needed
- Obtain peak and trough levels around the 4th dose of therapy
- Continue Levophed for BP support
- PCWP adequate, no additional fluid resuscitation required

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with respiratory failure. The patient desaturated while at rehab and was transferred to the emergency room. In the ER, she was intubated due to respiratory failure and an EKG showed ST elevations and lateral depressions. She was started on dopamine for shock and underwent a right heart catheterization (RHC) with a PCWP of 17 and mean PA pressure of 27.

The patient has a history of several medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. She also has allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, bactrim, and shellfish.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/60-130/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, arterial line, and pulmonary artery catheter.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (20.9 K/uL), hemoglobin (11.4 g/dL), and glucose level (357 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient desaturated while at rehab and was transferred to the emergency room. In the ER, she was intubated due to respiratory failure and an EKG showed ST elevations and lateral depressions. She was started on dopamine for shock and then transferred to the ICU.

Upon arrival in the ICU, an invasive arterial line was placed, and a right heart catheterization (RHC) was performed while on dopamine. The RHC results showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 17 mmHg and a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) of 27 mmHg. The patient also had a urine culture growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and was started on gentamicin. A chest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral multifocal infiltrates.

The patient has been mechanically ventilated since August 31st, 7:00 PM. Blood cultures were obtained on August 31st, 7:55 PM, and sputum culture was obtained on August 31st, 7:56 PM. A pulmonary artery (PA) catheter was inserted on August 31st, 7:59 PM. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 104 mmHg, and HCO3- of 25 mEq/L.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate (HR) of 71 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 130/60 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%.

Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) are 34/16 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) is 10 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 74-79%.

The patient received a total of 3,030 mL of fluids, with an output of 2,030 mL of urine and 3,030 mL of blood products. She was receiving midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and norepinephrine infusions. Her FiO2 was set at 40%, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, and tidal volume (Vt) at 420 mL. ABG analysis showed a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 260.

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. They were desaturated while at rehab and transferred to the emergency room. The EKG showed ST elevations anteriorly and lateral depressions. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and started on dopamine for shock. A right heart catheterization was performed, showing a PCWP of 17 and mean PA pressure of 27. The urine culture grew GNRs, and the patient was started on gentamicin. A chest X-ray revealed multifocal pneumonia.

   RUQUS: Cystic lesion in right lobe of liver with septations noted,
   likely reflects a complex cyst. The differential remains broad, and
   includes abscess, echinococcal cyst, or other infections, though lack
   of complex internal echogenicity and lack of peripheral reactive
   hyperemia make an abscess less likely. A CT may be helpful in further
   characterization.

   [**2168-9-1**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity

   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is
   a 5.0 x 4.4-cm heterogenous (cystic) subdiaphragmatic echodensity
   abutting the inferior vena cava, which appears to be extrahepatic (cine
   loops #56-60), etiology unknown.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred from the outpatient setting to the hospital for cardiac catheterization. The patient presented with multifocal pneumonia and presumed urosepsis. She has multiple comorbidities, including a previous myocardial infarction, sick sinus syndrome, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure and shock. She has been diagnosed with septic shock secondary to a urinary tract infection caused by gram-negative bacilli, likely E. coli, Proteus, Enterobacter, or Serratia. The patient has been resuscitated with fluids and is receiving antibiotics (gentamicin, aztreonam, and vancomycin).

She is also being supported with levophed for blood pressure management and will continue to receive daily gentamicin dosing. The patient's creatinine levels will be monitored closely and adjusted as needed. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been obtained to guide further treatment.

The patient's cardiac catheterization demonstrated minimal luminal irregularities in the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and circumflex artery. No acute coronary syndrome was identified, so aspirin and heparin have been continued.

   Imaging: CXR: Patchy infiltrates throughout.
   .
   RUQUS: Cystic lesion in right lobe of liver with septations noted,
   likely reflects a complex cyst. The differential remains broad, and
   includes abscess, echinococcal cyst, or other infections, though lack
   of complex internal echogenicity and lack of peripheral reactive
   hyperemia make an abscess less likely. A CT may be helpful in further
   characterization.
   .
   [**2168-9-1**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
   imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is
   a 5.0 x 4.4-cm heterogenous (cystic) subdiaphragmatic echodensity
   abutting the inferior vena cava, which appears to be extrahepatic (cine
   loops #56-60), etiology unknown.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild diastolic LV
   dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Extracardiac cystic structure,
   as described above.
   Recommend follow-up with an abdominal CT scan or a right upper quadrant

   #Hypotension/Urosepsis: Supported by elevated WBC, left shift and
   positive urine culture OSH (GRAM NEGATIVE BACILLI - suggesting E. Coli,
   Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia). Febrile yesterday.  Right heart cath
   demonstrates hyperdynamic septic shock. Due to complicated allergy
   history patient received Gentamicin in cath lab. By early goal directed
   therapy patient has been adequately resuscitated based on PCWP 15.
   Also with
 bottles GPC- has 2 PIV
s, R IJ, a line placed currently. PA
   catheter replaced with R IJ yesterday, placed over wire. Added on
   aztreonam and vancomycin to gentamicin yesterday.
   - continue gentamicin, aztreonam, vancomycin, patient receiving
   gentamicin 450 mg IV for daily dosing. Day 1 of gentamicin [**2168-8-31**].
   Aztreonam/vanco started on [**2168-9-1**]. Vanco for pneumonia coverage. Will
   try to add on sensitivities for aztreonam to urine from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**] in
   case have renal issues with gentamicin.
   - monitor creatinine closely and adjust gentamicin if needed
   - obtain peak and trough levels around the 4th dose of therapy
   - continue Levophed and fluid boluses for BP support
   - PCWP adequate therefore no additional fluid resuscitation required
   - follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   -liver cyst likely not infectious in nature based on prelim reports
   from RUQ u/s. Will defer CT for now since will likely need contrast and
   already getting gentamycin and hypotensive.
   -ID consult to determine better option for atypical organisms in light
   of multiple allergies
   -Rule out for flu/viral etiology

   Imaging: CXR: Patchy infiltrates throughout.
   .
   RUQUS: Cystic lesion in right lobe of liver with septations noted,
   likely reflects a complex cyst. The differential remains broad, and
   includes abscess, echinococcal cyst, or other infections, though lack
   of complex internal echogenicity and lack of peripheral reactive
   hyperemia make an abscess less likely. A CT may be helpful in further
   characterization.
   .
   [**2168-9-1**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
   imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is
   a 5.0 x 4.4-cm heterogenous (cystic) subdiaphragmatic echodensity
   abutting the inferior vena cava, which appears to be extrahepatic (cine
   loops #56-60), etiology unknown.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild diastolic LV
   dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Extracardiac cystic structure,
   as described above.
   Recommend follow-up with an abdominal CT scan or a right upper quadrant
   ultrasounds; findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2557**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10286**] at 1520

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation, who was transferred to the ICU for cardiac catheterization. She presented with multifocal pneumonia and presumed urosepsis. The patient's medical history includes a previous myocardial infarction, sick sinus syndrome, and a cerebrovascular accident. She has allergies to Naprosyn, Keflex, shellfish, Glucophage, Tetracycline, Penicillins, Erythromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Biaxin, and Bactrim.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 120/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, left shift, and positive urine culture for gram-negative bacteria suggesting E. coli, Proteus, Enterobacter, or Serratia. Blood cultures are pending.

Imaging studies reveal a complex liver cyst with septations, likely reflecting a complex cyst, abscess, echinococcal cyst, or other infections. A follow-up abdominal CT scan or right upper quadrant ultrasound is recommended. An echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for cardiac catheterization. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and presumed urosepsis. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
- Heart rate: 72 bpm
- Blood pressure: 102/45 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97%
- Central venous pressure: 2 mmHg

The patient has been extubated and is now receiving supplemental oxygen through a face tent. She is being supported with invasive ventilation, but the ventilator settings are not specified in the note.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, left shift, and positive urine culture for Klebsiella. Blood cultures have also grown Gram-positive cocci. The patient received gentamicin in the cath lab due to her complicated allergy history. She is currently receiving ceftriaxone for the Klebsiella infection and vancomycin for the Gram-positive cocci infection. 

The patient has a history of complex liver cysts, which may suggest an abscess. A CT scan in the future will be considered to further evaluate this. The patient's cardiac catheterization demonstrated"

   Aztreonam/vanco started on [**2168-9-1**]. Vanco for pneumonia coverage. Will
   try to add on sensitivities for aztreonam to urine from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**] in
   case have renal issues with gentamicin.
   - monitor creatinine closely and adjust gentamicin if needed
   - obtain peak and trough levels around the 4th dose of therapy
   -continue boluses prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred to the ICU for cardiac catheterization but is now being treated for respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and other shock. The patient has multifocal pneumonia and presumed urosepsis. She is febrile and has hypotension. A right heart cath demonstrated hyperdynamic septic shock. The patient received gentamicin in the cath lab due to her complicated allergy history. She has been adequately resuscitated based on PCWP 15. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to multifocal pneumonia.
2. Other Shock: The patient is in hyperdynamic septic shock.
3. Urosepsis: The patient has positive urine culture, elevated WBC, left shift, and signs of infection.
4. Allergy History: The patient has allergies to Naproxen, Cephalexin, Shellfish, Glucophage, Tetracycline, Penicillins, Erythromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Biaxin, Bactrim, and Aztreonam.
5. Complex Liver Cyst: The patient has a liver cyst that may suggest an abscess. Further evaluation is needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization but was transferred from the operating room due to multifocal pneumonia and presumed urosepsis. The patient has multiple allergies and received gentamicin in the cath lab. She has been adequately resuscitated based on PCWP 15. The patient has an arterial line, central line, and PA catheter in place. She is receiving multiple antibiotics, including aztreonam, vancomycin, and gentamicin. The plan is to continue these medications, monitor creatinine levels closely, and obtain peak and trough levels of gentamicin. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to ARDS or multifocal pneumonia. The complex liver cyst is suggestive of an abscess, but further evaluation may be needed. The patient's cardiac status shows minimal luminal irregularities in the RCA. She has sick sinus syndrome and is being paced. Her diabetes, history of CVA, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, and GERD are also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if her ARDS does not improve or if she develops new lung infections.
2. Urosepsis: The patient may continue to experience hypotension and organ dysfunction due to urosepsis, especially"

   #Sepsis: Supported by elevated WBC, left shift and positive urine
   culture at OSH for klebs. Febrile yesterday.  Right heart cath
   demonstrates hyperdynamic septic shock. Due to complicated allergy
   history patient received Gentamicin in cath lab, susequently switched
   to ceftriaxone. By Also with 2/4  bottles GPC- has 2 PIV

   line placed currently.
   - on ceftriaxone for klebsiella (start date [**2168-8-31**]), will need 2 week
   course of treatment
   -coag negative staph in blood cultures (in aerobic bottle, still
   identified as GPC in anerobic bottle). Added on sensitivities today.
   Will continue vancomycin for now, pending sensitivites. Will culture

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization but developed multifocal pneumonia and presumed urosepsis. The patient has several medical conditions including sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, complex liver cyst, cardiac issues, atrial fibrillation, history of CVA, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has elevated WBC count, left shift, and positive urine culture for klebsiella, indicating a possible infection leading to sepsis. She is currently being treated with antibiotics.
2. Hyperdynamic septic shock: Right heart cath demonstrated hyperdynamic septic shock, which can lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Klebsiella pneumonia: The patient has a positive urine culture for klebsiella, suggesting a respiratory infection. She is being treated with ceftriaxone for this condition.
4. Coag-negative staph infection: There is evidence of coag-negative staph infection in the blood cultures. The patient is being treated with vancomycin pending sensitivities.
5. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially had hypoxic respiratory failure but has improved and was extubated.
6. Complex liver cyst: The patient has a known complex liver cyst, but no"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization but presented with multifocal pneumonia and presumed urosepsis. The patient has been febrile and demonstrates hyperdynamic septic shock. She has an allergy history and received gentamicin in the cath lab, followed by ceftriaxone. She also has coag-negative staph in blood cultures. The patient's respiratory failure has improved, and she was extubated. Additional assessments include complex liver cyst, cardiac issues, sick sinus syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2, history of cerebrovascular accident, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has an elevated WBC, left shift, positive urine culture for klebsiella, and febrile status, indicating a possible sepsis condition.
2. Hyperdynamic septic shock: Right heart cath demonstrates this condition, suggesting inadequate tissue perfusion due to sepsis.
3. Coag-negative staph infection: The presence of coag-negative staph in blood cultures indicates a potential bloodstream infection.
4. Allergic reactions: The patient has allergies to several medications, including naproxen, cephalexin, shellfish,"
