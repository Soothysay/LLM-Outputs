   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old female with no significant medical history who presented with acute shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:

1. Sinus tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contractions (PACs) and two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The ECG shows evidence of atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.

2. Tachycardia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient may have had recurrent asymptomatic SVT for some time, leading to tachycardia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. This is suggested by the finding of a dilated left ventricular cavity with depressed systolic function on echocardiogram.

3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient likely has acute systolic CHF, possibly due to tachycardia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. There is evidence of airspace opacity at the lung bases, a right pleural effusion, and an enlarged heart silhouette on imaging. The patient has been diuresed and will undergo further evaluation with a formal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) today.

4. Mitral regurgitation: Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is seen on echocardiogram, but there is no evidence of aortic stenosis or"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of no known allergies, presenting with acute shortness of breath. Upon admission, she was found to be in sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contractions (PACs) and two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The EKG suggested atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction. Despite administration of lopressor, the patient's heart rate remains uncontrolled.

The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and is showing signs of pulmonary edema, as evidenced by crackles at the lung bases and a right pleural effusion. An echocardiogram reveals depressed left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction less than 30%. There is also mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. No pericardial effusion is seen.

The patient's thrombocytopenia could be due to myeloproliferative or dysplastic syndrome, although it is unlikely to be heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The polycythemia could be secondary to polycythemia vera or another cause unrelated to chronic hypoxia. Renal failure is likely acute, possibly due to CHF.

The patient is currently on amiodarone for rate control and is expected to start heparin for anticoagulation. Cardioversion"

   TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. LV systolic
   function appears depressed (ejection fraction ? 30 percent). The
   inferior and posterior walls appear akinetic; the rest of the left
   ventricle appears hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size is
   normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta
   at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   ECG: evidence of typical a. flutter with 2:1 conduction this morning
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 75 yo F without [**Hospital **] medical hx presented with acute
   SOB.
   .
   # SVT
 pt entirely asymptomatic.  Appears to be in typical a. flutter,
   with intermittent a. fib.  Manual BP 118/66 after one liter NS.  Did
   not respond to lopressor 2.5 mg IV x 2.  Given lack of symptoms, pt may
   have had recurrent asymptomatic SVT for some time, with resultant
   tachycardia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.
   -  will attempt rate control with dilt
   -  pt will likely need anti-coagulation with heparin, will defer for
   now given thrombocytopenia
   -  will start amio 400 tid today
   - will start heparin ggt
   - will consider cardioversion if medication not successful for rate
   control
   .
   # Pump: CHF, with likely tachycardia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.
   -formal TTE today
   -will restarte low dose Ace-I today
   -heparin ggt
   -stress as outpatient when rate controlled and stable
   .
   # Acute sob: most consistent with acute systolic CHF, unclear
   [**Name2 (NI) 8247**], likely acute/subacute cardiomyopathy due to viral
   infection, possibly also due to pericardial effusion (?malignancy),
   unlikely due to ACS as minimal enzyme elevation and no concerning EKG.
   - Diurese -> pt (-) 2 liters since admission
   - ECHO -> see above
   - BNP -> will f/u today
   - wean O2 -> down from 5 to 3 liters n/c
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: possibly due to hypoxia, vs
   myocarditis/pericarditis.  Multiple PACs likely trigger for current SVT
   - monitor
   - treat underlying cause: CHF
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: in the setting of polycythemia could be due to
   myeloproliferative or dysplastic syndrome. unlikely HIT. no signs of
   sepsis, TTP. also possible to be secondary to bone marrow supression
   from viral infection, though unlikely
   - stop  hep gtt
   - trend
   - once pt more stable will obtain Heme consult for further assistance
   - no evidence of hemolysis on smear, will review again today

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with no known medical history who presented with acute shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure/pulmonary edema, but there is also suspicion of a superimposed infection. 

The patient's vital signs indicate persistent sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contractions (PACs), and she has had two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction. The patient has been given lopressor IV 2.5 mg x 2 for rate control, but it has had little effect. Carotid massage was unsuccessful in terminating the SVT. The patient's blood pressure is in the 80s-90s, and she has received a total of 500 cc of normal saline bolus x 2.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the lung bases and bilateral lower extremity edema. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T level. Imaging indicates airspace opacity at the lung bases, right pleural effusion, and an enlarged heart silhouette.

The assessment and plan suggest that the patient's acute shortness of breath is most consistent with acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), but the exact cause is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with no significant medical history who presented with acute shortness of breath. She was found to have tachycardia and atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. She also had evidence of fluid overload, as indicated by crackles at the lung bases and peripheral edema. The patient's ejection fraction is significantly reduced, suggesting a dilated cardiomyopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia): The patient has had multiple episodes of SVT, which can be potentially life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient is in atrial flutter with intermittent atrial fibrillation, which can lead to an irregular and often rapid heart rate, potentially causing hemodynamic instability.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, crackles at the lung bases, and peripheral edema are consistent with acute systolic CHF. If left untreated, this can lead to further fluid accumulation and respiratory compromise.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding complications. It is important to monitor her platelet count and consider interventions to address this issue.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has signs of renal dysfunction, as indicated by elevated creatinine and BUN levels. If left untreated, renal failure can lead"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old female with no previous medical history.
- She presented with worsening shortness of breath over four days, concerning for congestive heart failure exacerbation.
- The patient is currently in atrial flutter with intermittent atrial fibrillation.
- She has received Amiodarone and heparin infusions.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating in the 80s to 100s range.
- Her BNP level is significantly elevated at 9991.
- The patient has hypogammaglobulinemia.
- A fellow echo showed an ejection fraction of 30% with a dilated left ventricular cavity.
- The etiology of the systolic LV dysfunction is uncertain, possibly tachycardia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.
- Other possible etiologies include hypertension, ischemia, or viral myocarditis.
- The patient has been NPO since midnight.
- She received Lasix 20 IV and 40 po yesterday.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is isolated with no evidence of hemolysis or bleeding.
- Her acute kidney injury is likely prerenal or cardiorenal in etiology.
- The patient has been weaned off oxygen.
- She is currently on Amiodarone 400 tid, heparin gtt, and Lisinopril 5.
- Possible electrical cardioversion is planned for the morning.
- The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is already in atrial flutter with intermittent atrial fibrillation, which can lead to further complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest worsening heart failure, which can progress to respiratory failure, shock, or cardiogenic arrest.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering the use of anticoagulants like heparin.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to prolonged hospitalization and immobility.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac rhythm, kidney function, platelet count, and overall clinical condition to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old female with no prior medical history presenting with worsening shortness of breath over the past four days, which is concerning for congestive heart failure exacerbation.
- The patient is currently in atrial flutter with intermittent atrial fibrillation but remains asymptomatic.
- She has been started on Amiodarone 400 tid and heparin gtt. A decision has been made to perform DC cardioversion this morning after contacting SICU anesthesia.
- The patient has systolic left ventricular dysfunction and mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction, with an ejection fraction of 30% and a dilated left ventricular cavity. The etiology is uncertain, possibly tachycardia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. Other etiologies to consider include hypertension, ischemia, or viral myocarditis.
- The patient is also experiencing symptoms consistent with acute systolic heart failure, possibly due to acute/subacute cardiomyopathy secondary to viral infection, tachycardia-induced, or hypertension. It is unlikely due to acute coronary syndrome as there is minimal enzyme elevation and no concerning EKG findings.
- The patient has thrombocytopenia, with isolated low platelet count, normal CBC and smear, and no evidence of hemolysis or bleeding. This could be due to increased platelet destruction or other causes. HIT is"
