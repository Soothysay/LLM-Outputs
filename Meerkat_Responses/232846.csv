","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension. The patient's heart rate has been trending down after administration of Lopressor. The patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Amiodarone was given at 11 pm to control heart rate, but the patient's systolic pressures remained in the 100s overnight. The patient is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient has suspected community-acquired pneumonia and is receiving antibiotics. However, there is a risk of complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure if the infection does not improve.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 120s/70s, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
4. Fever: The patient has a fever, which may be indicative of an underlying infection or inflammatory process. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis is crucial.
5. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose level is within normal limits, but close monitoring is necessary to"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  As the patient has a history of WPW with wide
   complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**], will refrain from AV nodal blockade,
   especially verapamil, and digoxin as can induce conduction down the
   accessory pathway.  Also, as the patient has evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2186**]
   on [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] refrain from DC cardioversion and chemical cardioversion
   with procainamide, unless the patient becomes hemodynamically
   unstable.  Likely febrile illness and over treatment with levothyroxine
   for Hashimoto's contributing to patient's a fib with rapid ventricular
   rate.
   - Continue Amiodarone drip at increased rate, with some boluses for
   attempt at rhythm/rate control
   - Continue to use metoprolol for rate control, pt tolerated 10mg bolus
   IV yesterday, for rate control
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   - Will use lasix as needed for signs of heart failure, as the patient
   has been in a tachyarrhythmia for at least the last 24 hours and is at
   risk for tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.
   - Consider EP consult for possible EP study to attempt to determine if
   the A fib is dependent on the accessory pathway
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:
   - Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing [**Last Name (STitle) 1163**] from [**Hospital1 97**]
   - Continue Heparin drip
   .
   # Febrile Illness:  Fever, leukocytosis and productive cough likely
   secondary to respiratory illness.  As the patient has had cough,
   malaise and general body weakness flu is on differential, as well as
   other viral illness or CAP.
   - CXR showed evidence of questionable RLL and LLL pneumonia
   - Restarted Ceftriaxone (initially started at OSH) and doxycycline
   (azithromycin and levofloxacin can prolong the QT interval) for
   presumed CAP.
   - UA shows possible UTI, antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone
   - F/U  Blood, sputum and urine cultures, nasal aspirate
   - continue droplet precautions until flu ruled out
   - If pt develops diarrhea, would consider C diff given recent
   antibiotic course, although unlikely.
   - Tylenol PRN
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue to hold antihypertensives in the setting of A fib with RVR
   with episode of hypotension at OSH.  Will reevaluate and add back home
   antihypertensives, starting with the ACE as tolerated.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Unclear why the patient is not on a statin
   - F/U lipid studies
   .
   # Hashimoto's Thyroiditis:  Pt's TSH at OSH was 0.07, however free T4
   and T3 within normal limits.
   - TSH here 0.08, free T 4 wnl
   - continue to hold levothyroxine
   .
   # Depression:  Will hold sertraline for now as may prolong QT
   .
   # S/P Gastric Banding:  Continue vitamin supplementation and diet
   restrictions.
   .
   # OSA:  Will use home CPAP settings, pressure of 10, while inpatient
   .
   # FEN: 2gm NA diet, will monitor electrolytes
   .
   # ACCESS: R IJ placed at [**Hospital1 97**], confirm placement with CXR, if
   requires multi lumen catheter as of tomorrow, will consider resiting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW (Wolf Parkinson White), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has evidence of stasis dermatitis, obesity, and 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. He also has leukocytosis, an elevated white blood cell count, and fever, which may indicate an infection. 

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has a history of WPW, which increases the risk of developing atrial fibrillation. The rapid ventricular response needs to be controlled to prevent hemodynamic instability.
2. Possible CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia): The patient has symptoms of a respiratory illness, including cough, malaise, and general body weakness. He also has leukocytosis, fever, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray.
3. Possible UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient's urine analysis shows signs of a possible urinary tract infection.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, but antihypertensive medications are currently held due to the presence of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
5. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: The patient has a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but his thyroid hormone levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  As the patient has a history of WPW with wide
   complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**], will refrain from AV nodal blockade,
   especially verapamil, and digoxin as can induce conduction down the
   accessory pathway.  Also, as the patient has evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2186**]
   on [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] had to refrain from DC cardioversion and chemical
   cardioversion with procainamide, unless the patient becomes
   hemodynamically unstable.  Likely febrile illness and over treatment
   with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's contributing to patient's a fib with
   rapid ventricular rate.
   - Continue Amiodarone drip at increased rate, with some boluses for
   attempt at rhythm/rate control
   - Continue to use metoprolol for rate control-> will start PO
   metoprolol and give another bolus IV metoprolol.
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   - Will use lasix as needed for signs of heart failure, as the patient
   has been in a tachyarrhythmia for at least the last 24 hours and is at
   risk for tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.
   - Will need cardioversion in future after coumadin therapeutic X3 weeks
   and then potentially an anti-arrhythmic to keep him in sinus rhythm
   - If pt has stable VT we will give lidocaine, if has AF with aberrancy
   will start procainimide. If unstable will DCCV.
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:
   - Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing [**Last Name (STitle) 1163**] from [**Hospital1 97**]
   - Continue Heparin drip
   -Start coumadin today
   .
   # Febrile Illness:  Fever, leukocytosis and productive cough likely
   secondary to respiratory illness.  As the patient has had cough,
   malaise and general body weakness flu is on differential, as well as
   other viral illness or CAP.
   - CXR showed evidence of questionable RLL and LLL pneumonia
   - Restarted Ceftriaxone (initially started at OSH) and doxycycline
   because initial concern about azithromycin and levofloxacin can prolong
   the QT interval although should not be a risk in this patient given
   normal QT on previous EKGs.
   - Continue doxy/ctx
   - UA shows possible UTI, antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone
   - F/U  Blood, sputum and urine cultures, nasal aspirate
   - continue droplet precautions until flu ruled out
   - If pt develops diarrhea, would consider C diff given recent
   antibiotic course, although unlikely.
   - Tylenol PRN
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue to hold antihypertensives in the setting of A fib with RVR
   with episode of hypotension at OSH.  Will reevaluate and add back home
   antihypertensives, starting with the ACE as tolerated.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Unclear why the patient is not on a statin
   - F/U lipid studies
   .
   # Hashimoto's Thyroiditis:  Pt's TSH at OSH was 0.07, however free T4
   and T3 within normal limits.
   - TSH here 0.08, free T 4 wnl
   - continue to hold levothyroxine
   - consider endocrine cls

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A fib with RVR). The patient has been treated with amiodarone, metoprolol, heparin, and lasix. He is also on a 2gm sodium diet and monitored for electrolyte imbalances. The patient has a confirmed presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and prophylaxis is being given. His code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient has been in a tachyarrhythmia for at least 24 hours, which can lead to cardiomyopathy.
2. Stroke: With atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response, there is an increased risk of blood clots forming in the heart, which can potentially travel to the brain and cause a stroke.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray, which may require antibiotic treatment.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a possible UTI, and antibiotic coverage is being provided.
5. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has recently received antibiotics, which increases the risk of developing C"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old obese male with a medical history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A fib with RVR). The patient has been treated with various medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, heparin, and lasix. He also has evidence of stasis dermatitis, 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities, and a history of gastric banding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's prolonged period of tachycardia may lead to cardiomyopathy, which can compromise cardiac function.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and obesity put him at risk for developing DVT. Prophylactic heparin drip has been initiated.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of possible right lower lobe and left lower lobe pneumonia. This could be due to a respiratory illness or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), for which antibiotics have been restarted.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipid levels are not well controlled, increasing the risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Hashimoto's thyroiditis: The patient is likely over-treated with levothyroxine, leading to subclinical hyperthyroidism"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  As the patient has a history of WPW with wide
   complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**], will refrain from AV nodal blockade,
   especially verapamil, and digoxin as can induce conduction down the
   accessory pathway.  Also, as the patient has evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2186**]
   on [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] refrain from DC cardioversion and chemical cardioversion
   with procainamide, unless the patient becomes hemodynamically
   unstable.  Likely febrile illness and over treatment with levothyroxine
   for Hashimoto's contributing to patient's a fib with rapid ventricular
   rate.
   - Continue Amiodarone drip at increased rate, with some boluses for
   attempt at rhythm/rate control
   - Continue to use metoprolol for rate control, pt tolerated 10mg bolus
   IV yesterday, for rate control
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   - Will use lasix as needed for signs of heart failure, as the patient
   has been in a tachyarrhythmia for at least the last 24 hours and is at
   risk for tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.
   - Consider EP consult for possible EP study to attempt to determine if
   the A fib is dependent on the accessory pathway
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:
   - Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing [**Last Name (STitle) 1163**] from [**Hospital1 97**]
   - Continue Heparin drip
   .
   # Febrile Illness:  Fever, leukocytosis and productive cough likely
   secondary to respiratory illness.  As the patient has had cough,
   malaise and general body weakness flu is on differential, as well as
   other viral illness or CAP.
   - CXR showed evidence of questionable RLL and LLL pneumonia
   - Restarted Ceftriaxone (initially started at OSH) and doxycycline
   (azithromycin and levofloxacin can prolong the QT interval) for
   presumed CAP.
   - UA shows possible UTI, antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone
   - F/U  Blood, sputum and urine cultures, nasal aspirate
   - continue droplet precautions until flu ruled out
   - If pt develops diarrhea, would consider C diff given recent
   antibiotic course, although unlikely.
   - Tylenol PRN
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue to hold antihypertensives in the setting of A fib with RVR
   with episode of hypotension at OSH.  Will reevaluate and add back home
   antihypertensives, starting with the ACE as tolerated.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Unclear why the patient is not on a statin
   - F/U lipid studies

   # Hashimoto's Thyroiditis:  Pt's TSH at OSH was 0.07, however free T4
   and T3 within normal limits.
   - TSH here 0.08, free T 4 wnl
   - continue to hold levothyroxine
   .
   # Depression:  Will hold sertraline for now as may prolong QT

   # S/P Gastric Banding:  Continue vitamin supplementation and diet
   restrictions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old obese male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A fib with RVR). The patient's current medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, and heparin. He is also on a sodium-restricted diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's prolonged tachyarrhythmia may lead to a decline in cardiac function, resulting in cardiomyopathy.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia on chest X-ray. This could potentially worsen if not treated appropriately.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine analysis shows possible UTI, which should be treated with appropriate antibiotics.
4. Hyperthyroidism: The patient has a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are low, indicating possible hyperthyroidism.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and antihypertensive medications may need to be adjusted once the A fib with RVR is controlled.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipid profile should be further evaluated, and management should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A fib with RVR). The patient has been treated with amiodarone, metoprolol, heparin, and Lasix. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C, heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure of 120/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's sustained tachyarrhythmia for at least 24 hours puts him at risk for developing tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. This condition can lead to decreased left ventricular function and heart failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. This indicates a potential respiratory infection that may require further treatment and monitoring.

   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  As the patient has a history of WPW with wide
   complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**], will refrain from AV nodal blockade,
   especially verapamil, and digoxin as can induce conduction down the
   accessory pathway.  Also, as the patient has evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2186**]
   on [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] refrain from DC cardioversion and chemical cardioversion
   with procainamide, unless the patient becomes hemodynamically
   unstable.  Likely febrile illness and over treatment with levothyroxine
   for Hashimoto's contributing to patient's a fib with rapid ventricular
   rate.
   - Continue Amiodarone drip at increased rate, with some boluses for
   attempt at rhythm/rate control
   - Continue to use metoprolol for rate control, pt tolerated 10mg bolus
   IV yesterday and this am, for rate control
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   - Will use lasix as needed for signs of heart failure, as the patient
   has been in a tachyarrhythmia for at least the last 24 hours and is at
   risk for tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.
   - Consider EP consult for possible EP study to attempt to determine if
   the A fib is dependent on the accessory pathway
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:
   - Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing [**Last Name (STitle) 1163**] from [**Hospital1 97**]
   - Continue Heparin drip
   .
   # Febrile Illness:  Fever, leukocytosis and productive cough likely
   secondary to respiratory illness.  As the patient has had cough,
   malaise and general body weakness flu is on differential, as well as
   other viral illness or CAP.
   - CXR showed evidence of questionable RLL and LLL pneumonia
   - Restarted Ceftriaxone (initially started at OSH) and doxycycline
   because initial concern about azithromycin and levofloxacin can prolong
   the QT interval however should not be a risk in this patient given
   normal QT on previous EKGs. Do will restart azithro and d/c doxy today
   - UA shows possible UTI, antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone
   - F/U  Blood, sputum and urine cultures, nasal aspirate
   - continue droplet precautions until flu ruled out
   - If pt develops diarrhea, would consider C diff given recent
   antibiotic course, although unlikely.
   - Tylenol PRN
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue to hold antihypertensives in the setting of A fib with RVR
   with episode of hypotension at OSH.  Will reevaluate and add back home
   antihypertensives, starting with the ACE as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old obese male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A fib with RVR). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and increased temperature. Physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, diaphoresis, flushed skin, and irregularly irregular rhythm. The patient has a prolonged QT interval on EKG and evidence of stasis dermatitis. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated troponin I, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including possible Hashimoto's thyroiditis and depression. He underwent gastric banding surgery and has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient is currently on several medications and has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
   - Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to prolonged tachyarrhythmia.
   - Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation if not controlled.
   - Potential risk of thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation.

2. Respiratory Complications:
   - Respiratory distress due to pneumonia or other respiratory illness.

   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  As the patient has a history of WPW with wide
   complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**], will refrain verapamil, and digoxin as
   can induce conduction down the accessory pathway.  Also, the patient
   has evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2186**] on [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] had to refrain from DC
   cardioversion and chemical cardioversion with procainamide, unless the
   patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.  Likely febrile illness and
   over treatment with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's contributing to
   patient's a fib with rapid ventricular rate.
   - Continue Amiodarone drip at increased rate, with some boluses for
   attempt at rhythm/rate control
   - Continue to use metoprolol for rate control as BP allows
currently
   150mg TID with some lower pressures so cannot increase at this time.
   Consider slight amount of fluids, given fevers and low PO intake with
   illness, to inc BP a little and then might be able to inc metoprolol.
   - D/W endocrine re switch to propanolol
   - c/s esmolol drip or diltiazem ggt if rate still elevated
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   - Will need cardioversion in future after coumadin therapeutic X3 weeks
   and then potentially an anti-arrhythmic to keep him in sinus rhythm
   - Pt has h/o VT. If pt has stable VT we will give lidocaine, if has AF
   with aberrancy will start procainimide. If unstable will DCCV.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), a heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/77 to 160/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has been started on oral metoprolol 150 mg three times a day, but the dose cannot be increased due to low blood pressure. He is also receiving an amiodarone drip with some boluses for rhythm and rate control. The patient has evidence of stasis dermatitis on his lower extremities and has a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), for which he is receiving heparin therapy. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but his lipids are slightly elevated. The patient has a history of viral illness and may have been overtreated with levothyroxine for his Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Further evaluation and management are planned, including a thyroid ultrasound, thyroid function tests, and an endocrine consultation.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  As the patient has a history of WPW with wide
   complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**], will refrain verapamil, and digoxin as
   can induce conduction down the accessory pathway.  Also, the patient
   has evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2186**] on [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] had to refrain from DC
   cardioversion and chemical cardioversion with procainamide, unless the
   patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.  Likely febrile illness and
   over treatment with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's contributing to
   patient's a fib with rapid ventricular rate.
   - Continue Amiodarone drip at increased rate, with some boluses for
   attempt at rhythm/rate control
   - Continue to use metoprolol for rate control as BP allows
currently
   150mg TID with some lower pressures so cannot increase at this time.
   Consider slight amount of fluids, given fevers and low PO intake with
   illness, to inc BP a little and then might be able to inc metoprolol.
   - D/W endocrine re switch to propanolol
   - c/s esmolol drip or diltiazem ggt if rate still elevated
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   - Will need cardioversion in future after coumadin therapeutic X3 weeks
   and then potentially an anti-arrhythmic to keep him in sinus rhythm
   - Pt has h/o VT. If pt has stable VT we will give lidocaine, if has AF
   with aberrancy will start procainimide. If unstable will DCCV.
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:
   - Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing [**Last Name (STitle) 1163**] from [**Hospital1 97**]
   - Continue Heparin drip with coumadin bridge until INR therapeutic
   # Febrile Illness: Presentation and CXR consistent with CAP.
   - Continue doxy/ctx (first dose [**2108-3-10**])
   - UA shows possible UTI, antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone
   - F/U  Blood, sputum and urine cultures, nasal aspirate culture all
   pending. Nasal aspirate antigen test negative so flu precautions d/c
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Consider IVF as above.
   # Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: overtreatment with levoxyl. Following TFTs
   - continue to hold levothyroxine
   - Appreciate endocrine recs
   - Will have thyroid u/s today
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Unclear why the patient is not on a statin
   - Lipid studies with lipids at goal so no need for statin at this time
   given no h/o CAD or DM
   # FEN: 2gm NA diet, will monitor electrolytes
   # ACCESS: R IJ placed at [**Hospital1 97**], confirm placement with CXR, if
   requires multi lumen catheter as of tomorrow, will consider resiting.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has evidence of atrial fibrillation with a history of WPW, so certain medications like verapamil and digoxin are contraindicated. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure of 101/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving amiodarone infusion for rhythm and rate control, as well as metoprolol for rate control. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly high potassium levels, and normal glucose levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but normal international normalized ratio (INR). 

The assessment and plan include continued amiodarone infusion, adjustment of metoprolol dose as tolerated, consideration of esmolol or diltiazem for additional rate control if needed, continuation of heparin drip for anticoagulation, and plans for cardioversion after therapeutic INR levels are achieved."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has been treated with various medications including lopressor, Zoloft, levoxyl, amiodarone, heparin, metoprolol, and ceftriaxone. He has also been evaluated for several conditions including febrile illness, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, depression, OSA, gastric banding, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's prolonged tachyarrhythmia may lead to the development of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, which can result in impaired cardiac function.
2. Stroke: Given the patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR, there is an increased risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of questionable right lower lobe and left lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray, indicating a potential respiratory infection.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urine analysis shows possible signs of a urinary tract infection, requiring further evaluation and treatment.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to the patient's immobilization in the ICU and risk factors, there is a potential risk for developing DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  As the patient has a history of WPW with wide
   complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**], will refrain verapamil, and digoxin as
   can induce conduction down the accessory pathway.  Also, the patient
   has evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2186**] on [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] had to refrain from DC
   cardioversion and chemical cardioversion with procainamide, unless the
   patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.  Likely febrile illness and
   over treatment with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's contributing to
   patient's a fib with rapid ventricular rate.
   - Continue Amiodarone drip at increased rate, with some boluses for
   attempt at rhythm/rate control
   - Continue to use metoprolol for rate control as BP allows
currently
   150mg TID with some lower pressures so cannot increase at this time.
   Consider slight amount of fluids, given fevers and low PO intake with
   illness, to inc BP a little and then might be able to inc metoprolol.
   - D/W endocrine re switch to propanolol
   - c/s esmolol drip or diltiazem ggt if rate still elevated
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   - Will need cardioversion in future after coumadin therapeutic X3 weeks
   and then potentially an anti-arrhythmic to keep him in sinus rhythm
   - Pt has h/o VT. If pt has stable VT we will give lidocaine, if has AF
   with aberrancy will start procainimide. If unstable will DCCV.
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:
   - Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing [**Last Name (STitle) 1163**] from [**Hospital1 97**]
   - Continue Heparin drip with coumadin bridge until INR therapeutic
   # Febrile Illness: Presentation and CXR consistent with CAP.
   - Continue doxy/ctx (first dose [**2108-3-10**])
   - UA shows possible UTI, antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone
   - F/U  Blood, sputum and urine cultures, nasal aspirate culture all
   pending. Nasal aspirate antigen test negative so flu precautions d/c
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Consider IVF as above.
   # Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: overtreatment with levoxyl. Following TFTs
   - continue to hold levothyroxine
   - Appreciate endocrine recs
   - Will have thyroid u/s today
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Unclear why the patient is not on a statin
   - Lipid studies with lipids at goal so no need for statin at this time
   given no h/o CAD or DM
   # FEN: 2gm NA diet, will monitor electrolytes
   # ACCESS: R IJ placed at [**Hospital1 97**], confirm placement with CXR, if
   requires multi lumen catheter as of tomorrow, will consider resiting.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Heparin drip + coumadin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). The patient has been treated with various medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, and levothyroxine. He also has evidence of stasis dermatitis and a central venous line placed in the right internal jugular vein.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): The patient's AFib/RVR is likely due to an over-treated condition of Hashimoto's thyroiditis with levothyroxine. There is a risk of further complications if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, requiring cardioversion with procainamide.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of VT. If the patient experiences stable VT, lidocaine may be given. If the patient has AFib with aberrancy, procainamide will be started. In case of unstable VT, defibrillation cardioversion (DCCV) will be performed.

3. Febrile Illness and Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP): The patient presents with signs of a febrile illness and possible CAP. Antibiotic coverage with doxycycline and c"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient is currently receiving amiodarone drip for rhythm and rate control, diltiazem for rate control, heparin for anticoagulation, and levothyroxine for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. He is also being treated for a febrile illness consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hyperlipidemia, and a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he is in mild respiratory distress and diaphoretic. Physical examination reveals no chest wall deformities, unlabored respirations, no crackles or wheezes, and 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels. The patient's thyroid function tests are abnormal, indicating overtreatment with levothyroxine. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's AF with RVR may lead to hemodynamic instability, decreased cardiac output, and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Ventricular"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently on digoxin and propranolol, but the rate control is not satisfactory. He is also on a heparin drip for anticoagulation. The plan is to transition to oral diltiazem and if rate control is still not achieved, add digoxin. The patient needs to be converted to sinus rhythm after three weeks of therapeutic INR on Coumadin, and an antiarrhythmic may be used to maintain sinus rhythm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation leading to hemodynamic instability.
2. Thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation and the patient's history of hyperlipidemia.
3. Potential side effects of digoxin and propranolol.
4. Poor glycemic control in the ICU setting.
5. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Risk of stress ulcers.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy.
8. Possible need for cardioversion, which carries a risk of complications such as stroke or arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown origin fever. They have been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and are currently on various medications, including diltiazem and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a CPAP mask. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but within normal range for creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient has been receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of an infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation and immobilization. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis is in place, but close monitoring for signs of thromboembolism is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating potential hypotension. This could be due to sepsis secondary to an infection or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old obese male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation (AF) and an unknown origin fever (FUO). The patient has been receiving various medications, including propanolol, diltiazem, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 bpm and slightly low blood pressure ranging from 99/72 to 145/102 mmHg. The patient is on CPAP mask for respiratory support with an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, diaphoresis, flushed skin, and an irregularly irregular rhythm consistent with AF.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Blood cultures and other test results are pending. The patient has a history of obesity, stasis dermatitis, and peripheral edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and peripheral edema increase the risk of developing DVT.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the potential presence of a clot in the atrial appendage seen on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), there is a risk of a clot dislodging and causing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are below normal"

   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   # Tachycardia:  most likely AVRT or A Fib with RVR and variable
   conduction. A possibility for concealed bypass tract exists.  On dig
   ggt and propanolo at total of 600 mg daily. Rate improved with more
   pauses notable on tele.
   - transition to oral diltiazem
   - if no rate control will add digoxin
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation.
   - Will need cardioversion in future after coumadin therapeutic X3 weeks
   and then potentially an anti-arrhythmic to keep him in sinus rhythm
   - Pt has h/o VT. If pt has stable VT we will give lidocaine, if has AF
   with aberrancy will start procainimide. If unstable will DCCV.
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]: Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing TEE
   from [**Hospital1 97**]
   - Continue Heparin drip with coumadin bridge until INR therapeutic
   # Febrile Illness: Presentation and CXR consistent with CAP.
   - Continue doxy/ctx (first dose [**2108-3-10**])
   - Urine cultures negative
   - F/U  Blood and sputum cultures
   # Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: overtreatment with levoxyl. Following TFTs
   - resolved per endocrine, who also suggests restarting levothyroxine
   - care with propanolol as it prevents conversion of T4 to T3.
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Lipid studies with lipids at goal so no need for statin at this time
   given no h/o CAD or DM

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), HTN (hypertension), and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). The patient is currently receiving digoxin and propranolol for rate control, and heparin drip for anticoagulation. The plan is to transition to oral diltiazem and potentially add digoxin if rate control is not achieved. The patient will need cardioversion in the future after achieving therapeutic INR on coumadin for three weeks, followed by an anti-arrhythmic to maintain sinus rhythm. The patient has a history of VT (ventricular tachycardia), and if he experiences stable VT, he will be given lidocaine; if he has AF with aberrancy, he will start procainimide; and if he is unstable, defibrillation will be performed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a probable clot, as indicated by the TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) interpretation. This increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient is currently experiencing AF with RVR, and there is a history of VT. The patient's underlying conditions"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  As the patient has a history of WPW with wide
   complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**], will refrain verapamil, and digoxin as
   can induce conduction down the accessory pathway.  Also, the patient
   has evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2186**] on [**Last Name (LF) 1163**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] had to refrain from DC
   cardioversion and chemical cardioversion with procainamide, unless the
   patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.  Likely febrile illness and
   over treatment with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's contributing to
   patient's a fib with rapid ventricular rate.
   - Continue Amiodarone drip at increased rate, with some boluses for
   attempt at rhythm/rate control
   - Continue to use metoprolol for rate control as BP allows
currently
   150mg TID with some lower pressures so cannot increase at this time.
   Consider slight amount of fluids, given fevers and low PO intake with
   illness, to inc BP a little and then might be able to inc metoprolol.
   - D/W endocrine re switch to propanolol
   - c/s esmolol drip or diltiazem ggt if rate still elevated
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   - Will need cardioversion in future after coumadin therapeutic X3 weeks
   and then potentially an anti-arrhythmic to keep him in sinus rhythm
   - Pt has h/o VT. If pt has stable VT we will give lidocaine, if has AF
   with aberrancy will start procainimide. If unstable will DCCV.
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:
   - Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing [**Last Name (STitle) 1163**] from [**Hospital1 97**]
   - Continue Heparin drip with coumadin bridge until INR therapeutic
   # Febrile Illness: Presentation and CXR consistent with CAP.
   - Continue doxy/ctx (first dose [**2108-3-10**])
   - UA shows possible UTI, antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone
   - F/U  Blood, sputum and urine cultures, nasal aspirate culture all
   pending. Nasal aspirate antigen test negative so flu precautions d/c
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Consider IVF as above.
   # Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: overtreatment with levoxyl. Following TFTs
   - continue to hold levothyroxine
   - Appreciate endocrine recs
   - Will have thyroid u/s today
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Unclear why the patient is not on a statin
   - Lipid studies with lipids at goal so no need for statin at this time
   given no h/o CAD or DM
   # FEN: 2gm NA diet, will monitor electrolytes
   # ACCESS: R IJ placed at [**Hospital1 97**], confirm placement with CXR, if
   requires multi lumen catheter as of tomorrow, will consider resiting.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), HTN (hypertension), and hyperlipidemia. The patient presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). 

The patient has been started on amiodarone drip for rhythm and rate control, with some boluses attempted. Metoprolol is being used for rate control as well, but the dosage cannot be increased at the moment due to low blood pressure. Propanolol is planned to be switched after endocrine consultation. Esmolol or diltiazem will be considered if the rate is still elevated. Heparin drip is being continued for anticoagulation. The patient will require cardioversion in the future after three weeks of therapeutic Coumadin and potentially an anti-arrhythmic to maintain sinus rhythm. 

The patient has a history of VT (ventricular tachycardia). If stable VT occurs, lidocaine will be given, while procainamide will be started if AFib with aberrancy is present. If the patient becomes unstable, defibrillation cardioversion (DCCV) will be performed.

There is also confirmation of the presence of [Last Name (Prefixes)] [Last Name (Prefixes)] from [Hospital1 97]. Heparin drip will continue with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   # Tachycardia:  most likely AVRT or A Fib with RVR and variable
   conduction. A possibility for concealed bypass tract exists.  On dig
   ggt and propanolo at total of 600 mg daily. Rate improved with more
   pauses notable on tele.
   - transition to oral diltiazem
   - if no rate control will add digoxin
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation.
   - Will need cardioversion in future after coumadin therapeutic X3 weeks
   and then potentially an anti-arrhythmic to keep him in sinus rhythm
   - Pt has h/o VT. If pt has stable VT we will give lidocaine, if has AF
   with aberrancy will start procainimide. If unstable will DCCV.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient is currently on digoxin and propranolol for rate control, but his heart rate is still uncontrolled. He is also receiving heparin for anticoagulation. The plan is to transition to oral diltiazem and continue heparin drip. Cardioversion is planned after achieving therapeutic INR for three weeks and then potentially starting an anti-arrhythmic to maintain sinus rhythm. The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT), and if it occurs, lidocaine will be given for stable VT, procainamide for AFib with aberrancy, or defibrillation for unstable VT. 

The patient also has confirmed presence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, overtreatment with levoxyl, and will be restarted on levothyroxine. He has a history of febrile illness consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and doxycycline/levofloxacin will be continued. Blood and sputum cultures are being followed up. The patient's lipid studies are within goal, so no statin is needed at this time. Contact information for the sister and healthcare provider is provided. The patient's"

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation and fluctuations in blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or thromboembolic events.
2. Infection: The patient's persistent fever of unknown origin suggests a possible infection. The patient may be at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock if an underlying infection is not identified and appropriately treated.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's fluctuating creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient is receiving Heparin Sodium, which increases the risk of bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and appropriate management are crucial to prevent hemorrhagic complications.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's use of CPAP mask for respiratory support increases the risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of respiratory status and adherence"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   # Tachycardia:  Some episodes of Aflutter on tele last night but no
   confirmatory EKG. With this rates into 120s. Otherwise rhythm most
   likely AVRT or A Fib with RVR and variable conduction. A possibility
   for concealed bypass tract exists.  Rate has improved with more pauses
   notable on tele over last several days.
   - On dilt ggt and propanolol at total of 660 mg daily.
   - transition to oral diltiazem
   - if not able to wean dilt and keep rate controlled will add digoxin
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation and continue bridge to
   coumadin
   - Will need cardioversion in future after coumadin therapeutic X3 weeks
   and then potentially an anti-arrhythmic to keep him in sinus rhythm
   - As has evidence of possible Aflutter may also benefit from ablation
   in the future
   - Pt has h/o VT. If pt has stable VT we will give lidocaine, if has AF
   with aberrancy will start procainimide. If unstable will DCCV.
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]: Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing TEE
   from [**Hospital1 97**]
   -          Continue Heparin drip with coumadin bridge until INR
   therapeutic
   -          Will inc dose of coumadin today as has been 1.3 for INR for
   several days on the 5mg and given body habitus likely needs higher

   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   # Tachycardia:  Some episodes of Aflutter on tele last night but no
   confirmatory EKG. With this rates into 120s. Otherwise rhythm most
   likely AVRT or A Fib with RVR and variable conduction. A possibility
   for concealed bypass tract exists.  Rate has improved with more pauses
   notable on tele over last several days.
   - transition to oral diltiazem.
   - decrease propanolol dose if does well with po dilt
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation and continue bridge to
   coumadin
   - Will need cardioversion in future after coumadin therapeutic X3 weeks
   and then potentially an anti-arrhythmic to keep him in sinus rhythm
   - Pt has h/o VT. If pt has stable VT we will give lidocaine, if has AF
   with aberrancy will start procainimide. If unstable will DCCV.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old obese male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation (AF) and rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's rhythm has improved with pauses noted on telemetry. He was started on diltiazem and his propranolol dose may be decreased if he tolerates the oral medication well. The patient is also on heparin for anticoagulation and will be bridged to warfarin. Cardioversion is planned after three weeks of therapeutic INR and potentially an anti-arrhythmic to maintain sinus rhythm. The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT). If he has stable VT, lidocaine will be given; if he has AF with aberrancy, procainamide will be started; and if unstable, defibrillation will be performed. The patient's presence of WPW was confirmed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5195**] after reviewing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) from [**Hospital1 97**]. The patient's Heparin drip will continue with a bridge to therapeutic INR on coumadin. The dose of coumadin will be increased due to the patient's body habitus. The patient is being treated for community-acquired pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's tachycardia has resolved, and he converted into sinus rhythm on his own. There are concerns about the presence of a thrombus, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be repeated to confirm this. The patient is currently on heparin drip for anticoagulation and will continue with a bridge to coumadin. An electrophysiology (EP) study for ablation of the WPW bypass tract has been planned as an outpatient procedure. The patient also has febrile illness consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which is being treated with doxycycline and azithromycin. Additionally, the patient has overtreatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis with levoxyl, and levothyroxine will be restarted. The patient's sister, HCP, can be contacted at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5190**]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombus formation: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of blood clot formation, which could lead to complications such as stroke or pulmonary embolism if not appropriately managed with anticoagulation therapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW (Wolf Parkinson White), HTN (hypertension), and hyperlipidemia. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). There are episodes of atrial flutter observed on telemetry, but no confirmatory EKG. The patient has been receiving heparin drip for anticoagulation and will continue bridging to Coumadin. Cardioversion may be needed in the future after three weeks of therapeutic Coumadin levels, and an anti-arrhythmic medication may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm. The patient has a history of VT (ventricular tachycardia), and if he experiences stable VT, lidocaine will be given; if he has AFib with aberrancy, procainamide will be started; and if unstable, defibrillation will be performed.

Additionally, the patient has confirmed presence of an atrial clot by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) from Hospital1. The dose of Coumadin will be increased today as the INR has been 1.3 for several days on the 5mg dose, and the patient's body habitus likely requires a higher dose.

The patient also has a febrile illness presentation and chest X-ray consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Doxycycline and azithromycin have been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's condition has progressed as follows: he initially had atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 40-50s and clear signs of WPW, posterior right septal bypass tract. He then converted into atrial flutter and subsequently into sinus rhythm on his own. The sinus rhythm was initially in the 40-50s but decreased to the 50s-60s after receiving propranolol. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 65 bpm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thromboembolism: The patient has been confirmed to have a thrombus in the [specific location] based on the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). This increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin and bridging to Coumadin is being continued until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic. Repeat TEE will be done today to confirm the presence of thrombus.
2. Infection: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Antibiotic therapy with doxycycline and azithromycin has been initiated, but there is some"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A fib with RVR). The patient's initial vital signs included a heart rate in the 40-50s, blood pressure ranging from 108/51 mmHg to 151/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP mask. The patient's ECG showed signs of WPW with a posterior right septal bypass tract, but later converted to a narrow complex rhythm.

The patient has been treated with various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, and Coumadin (warfarin). His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The patient's creatinine levels are within normal range, but his glucose levels have fluctuated between 95 and 133 mg/dL. Other lab results include prolonged PT/PTT/inr, low calcium levels, normal magnesium levels, and slightly elevated phosphate levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Tachycardia: The patient's initial tachycardia resolved, and he was admitted with A fib with RVR. His heart rate has been maintained in the 40-50s"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has been in sinus rhythm in the 40-50s, initially with clear signs of WPW, posterior right septal bypass tract, but now has a narrow complex. The patient received diltiazem and propranolol for rate control, with a decrease in propranolol dose due to significant bradycardia. He continues to be in sinus rhythm. The patient also has a febrile illness consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), for which he will be discharged on cefpodoxime and doxycycline. His Hashimoto's thyroiditis is being managed with levothyroxine, and he has overtreatment with levoxyl. The patient's sister and fiancé have been contacted as his healthcare power of attorney holders.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thromboembolism: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of forming blood clots that can travel to other parts of the body, leading to complications such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.
2. Arrhythmias: WPW syndrome increases the risk of developing life-threatening arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and ventricular t"

   # Tachycardia:  Resolved,  The patient went into A flutter from a fib
   two nights ago, then converted into sinus rhythm on his own.  The sinus
   rhythm was in the 40-50s initially with very clear signs of WPW,
   posterior right septal bypass tract.
   - Turned off dilt drip, continues to be in sinus, but now narrow
   - decreased propanolol dose to 80 TID yesterday tolerating well
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation and continue bridge to
   coumadin
   - Will require EP study for ablation of WPW bypass tract as an
   outpatient

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, WPW (Wolf Parkinson White), HTN (hypertension), and hyperlipidemia. He presented with A fib with RVR (atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response). The patient's tachycardia resolved, and he converted into sinus rhythm on his own. He continues to be in sinus rhythm but with signs of WPW, posterior right septal bypass tract. The patient is on a heparin drip for anticoagulation and will require an EP study for ablation of WPW bypass tract as an outpatient.

The patient also has a febrile illness consistent with CAP (community-acquired pneumonia). He is currently on doxy/ctx (first dose 03/10), day 5 of 7. His urine cultures are negative, but he had some hematuria during Foley catheterization. Blood and sputum cultures are negative to date. Foley catheter has been discontinued.

Additionally, the patient has Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and is being overtreated with levoxyl. His TFTs will be followed, and he will restart levothyroxine today. Care will be taken with propanolol as it prevents the conversion of T4 to T3.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of WPW and is currently on antico"
