","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently in the ICU for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) due to multiple myeloma. He has been experiencing recent fevers and increased sputum production, with sputum growing ESBL, which is sensitive only to meropenem. The patient has a history of prior ESBL bacteremia and his blood cultures and recently removed line are negative or pending. The BMT wishes to avoid nausea associated with tigecycline, so they plan to continue vancomycin and micafungin. They will discontinue aztreonam once meropenem is at full dose and start meropenem desensitization protocol per pharmacy with ICU monitoring. Daily blood cultures will be taken, and a CT scan will be done tonight to look for infection in the lungs. Rechecking sputum for infection is also planned.

The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of prolonged hospitalization, medications, and infection. He is delirious, and an MRI and LP have been done without evidence of infection. Psych and neuro recommendations are appreciated. Haldol will be given standing and PRN, with EKG monitoring if the dose is changed. Avoiding further psychotropic medications is recommended, and restraints and mittens may be used to prevent lines from being removed.

The patient had a prolonged intubation and required a tracheostomy,"

   # Fevers: Hx of recent fevers and increased sputum production. Sputum
   growing ESBL, only sensitive to meropenem. Has hx of piror ESBL
   bacterermia. Current blood cx and recent removed line so far negative
   or pending. BMT would like to avoid nausea assoiciated with tigecycline
   since pt has tolearted meropeneum desensitization before. Did not start
   last night due to concern about timing of other medications via PICC
   line. CT scan shows lung infiltrates.
   - for now continue vanco and micafungin
   - will discontinue aztreonam once meropenem at full dose
   - will start meropenem desensitization protocol per pharmacy with ICU
   monitoring

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently on day +49 of an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has been transferred to the ICU for meropenem desensitization due to an ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient's medical history includes multiple complications such as altered mental status, tracheostomy, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, renal failure, myeloma, hyponatremia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy and pain, GERD, and familial endometrial neoplasia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of recent fevers and increased sputum production with sputum growing ESBL, which is sensitive only to meropenem. He is already on vancomycin and micafungin, and meropenem desensitization is being initiated. Daily blood cultures are planned to monitor for any new or persistent infections.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospital course, medications, and infection. Delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients and can be managed with haloperidol, restraints, and mittens to prevent line removal.

3. Tracheostomy: The patient had prolonged intub"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently in the ICU on day +51 of an allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. He was transferred to the ICU for meropenem desensitization due to ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient tolerated the desensitization overnight, and his blood cultures have been negative so far. He is still febrile with increased sputum production, and sputum is growing ESBL, which is sensitive only to meropenem.

He has a tracheostomy, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, renal failure requiring dialysis, myeloma, hyponatremia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy and pain, and GERD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to the stem cell transplant and ongoing bacteremia increases the risk of infections.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can be challenging to manage in the ICU setting.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs close monitoring and management.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) 49 days ago. He was transferred to the ICU for meropenem desensitization due to an infection caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli. The patient tolerated the desensitization overnight and his recent blood cultures and line so far are negative. Current medications include vancomycin, micafungin, and meropenem.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fevers: The patient has been febrile with increased sputum production. Sputum cultures are growing ESBL E. coli, which is sensitive only to meropenem. The plan is to continue vancomycin, micafungin, and monitor for 24 hours following desensitization. Daily and f/cu sputum and blood cultures are also planned.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has delirium, likely caused by a combination of factors including prolonged hospitalization, medications, and infection. An MRI showed no evidence of infection. The plan includes Haldol standing and PRN, EKG monitoring if Haldol dose is changed, avoiding further psychotropic medications, and restraints/mittens as needed to prevent line removal.
3. Tracheostomy: The patient required a tracheostomy due to prolonged intubation. The plan is to decrease tracheostomy size from 8mm to 6mm next week and work towards removing the tracheostomy.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is currently on IV metoprolol due to frequent removal of NGT for oral medications. The plan includes monitoring on tele, continuing metoprolol 20mg IV Q4H, and digoxin 0.125 every other day with levels Q48H.
5. Renal Failure: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) and had acute renal failure (ARF) during admission, thought to be caused by contrast and/or medications including gentamicin. The plan includes HD on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, renal dosing of medications as needed, and monitoring electrolytes.
6. Myeloma: The patient is now day +49 for SCT for multiple myeloma. The plan includes continuing acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis, holding ursodiol due to not being on PO meds, tapering mycophenolate mofetil today per BMT, and daily cyclosporine levels.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient had hyponatremia during a previous ICU stay from syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently day +51 post allogeneic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma. He was transferred to the ICU for meropenem desensitization due to ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient tolerated the desensitization overnight, and his blood cultures so far have been negative. The plan is to continue vancomycin and micafungin, start meropenum, and monitor for 24 hours following desensitization. Cultures will be checked in the morning, and feedback from the ID team is appreciated.

The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including prolonged hospitalization, medications, and infection. He is believed to be experiencing delirium, and an LP and MRI did not show evidence of infection. Haloperidol will be given as needed for agitation, and restraints and mittens will be used to prevent lines from being removed.

The patient has a tracheostomy, which was performed due to prolonged intubation. He is currently on a mask with stable oxygen requirements, and plans are to decrease the tracheostomy size from 8mm to 6mm next week with input from the pulmonary team. The concern is the risk of infection with tracheostomy removal.

   Disposition: Transfer to BMT following desensitization
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently in the ICU. He has been admitted for meropenem desensitization due to ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient is a day +52 post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma.

The patient continues to have fevers, and there is concern for a pulmonary source or Clostridium difficile infection. Sputum cultures have grown ESBL, which is only sensitive to meropenem. The patient has been pan-cultured, and blood cultures and recently removed line so far negative. It is recommended to continue vancomycin, meropenem (HD dosing), and micafungin. The possibility of stopping vancomycin is being considered. Aztreonam has been discontinued. Repeat cultures will be followed, and the patient will be started on cyclosporine.

The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, related to his prolonged hospital course, medications, and infection. He is believed to be delirious. An MRI and lumbar puncture did not show evidence of infection. Haloperidol will be given standing and as needed for agitation. Electrocardiogram monitoring will be implemented if the haloperidol dose is changed. Further psychotropic medications will be avoided. Restraints and mittens will be used as needed to prevent lines from being removed.
