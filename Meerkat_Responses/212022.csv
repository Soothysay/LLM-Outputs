   Assessment and Plan
   61F w/ ongoing Crohn's flare refractory to steroids, undergoing Humira
   induction, with RUE DVT and persistent bloody diarrhea draining through
   rectovaginal fistula, EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] w/ TI disease w/o source of GIB,
   bleeding scan pos at ileo-cecal area but angio procedure negative with
   repeat c-scope which did not show any active sites of bleeding
   # Acute blood loss anemiaCrohn's disease wtih intermittant
   melena/hematochezia.  EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] unrevealing, tagged red scan positive
   for bleed at ileo-cecal junction but angiogram negative for active
   bleed.
   - repeated c-scope on [**3-24**] without any active source of bleeding
   found.  no melena since procedure.  Gi recommended sending the stools
   for mycobacteria as that can cause diarrhea/melena
   - Q6 HCT drawn; slowly trending down still.  Patient is still
   hemodynamically stable, actually is hypertensive despite slow HCT drop
   - cont Q6 HCT check for now; d/w GI whether any other studies
   necessary; seems to be a fairly slow bleed.  may need capsule study to
   evaluate for small bowel AVMs or other source of bleeding
   - Will transfuse to a goal of >28 or HD instability
   # Crohn's disease: Patient is currently on Solumedrol 20 IV Q8H
   - not getting any PO meds right now; may consider restarting POs today-
   since likely no other imaging studies right now.
   - given a dose of MTX yesterday per GI.  Also recently started on
   Humira- got 2 doses.
   - Continue TPN given short gut
   # DVT: Patient found to have RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC
   line. Unable to anticoagulate patient at this time given her active GI
   bleed.
   - Heat packs to site, elevation of arm
   - Continue to monitor
   - Will discuss anticoagulation after resolution of bleed, though this
   will likely be an ongoing problem for the patient given her severe IBD.
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient is on levothyroxine 112mcg daily as an
   outpatient.
   - on IV levothyroxine until able to take POs.  will change once
   tolerating POs
   # Hypertension: On Moexipril and Atenolol as outpatient. Will hold
   anti-hypertensives for now in the setting of large GI bleed. Continues
   to be very hypertensive
   - titrated up on Hydral to 30 mg IV Q6H with prn labetaolol IV
   - will restart PO medications this AM- atenolol and moexipril
   # Osteoporosis: On Alendronate q Sunday and vitamin D/Calcium
   supplementation.
   - Continue outpatient regimen
   # Access: Currently has left sided PICC in place with dual lumen.
   # FEN: Patient is on TPN as an outpatient due to her malnutrition.
   - Continue TPN as per nutrition recs
   - Clear liquid diet
   - ISS given TPN and steroids
   - Follow amylase, lipase and LFTs on TPN
   # PPX: Pneumoboots, no heparin given GI bleed, not on ppi as outpatient
   but given duodenitis on EGD, will start protonix q24H

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with chronic Crohn's disease, anemia, and melena. She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed ulcers consistent with Crohn's disease but no active sites of bleeding. The patient has been started on ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and methotrexate as recommended by the GI team. She is also hypertensive with systolic blood pressure ranging from 150-190 mmHg and has been increased on hydralazine to 30 mg IV Q6H with PRN labetalol 10 mg IV x 1 as needed.

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on 03/24/2141 at 06:16 PM, and metronidazole on 03/25/2141 at 12:49 AM. She is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) at 10:00 AM on 03/24/2141, midazolam (Versed) at 04:36 PM on 03/24/2141, fentanyl at 04:36 PM on 03/24/2141, and hydralazine at 02:00 AM on 03/25/2141.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with chronic Crohn's disease and anemia presenting with melena. She underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed ulcers consistent with Crohn's disease but no active bleeding sites. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole by the GI team. She is also receiving methotrexate per GI recommendation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is hypertensive with a blood pressure ranging from 150-190 mmHg. Her hemoglobin level is low at 8.8 g/dL, and her hematocrit is 35.8%. The patient has a history of refractory Crohn's flare, RUE deep vein thrombosis (DVT), persistent bloody diarrhea, and rectovaginal fistula. She is undergoing induction therapy with Humira. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's ongoing melena and hematochezia indicate ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which has resulted in acute blood loss anemia. This condition requires close monitoring, and the patient may require blood transfusions to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
2. Crohn's Disease Flare: The patient's chronic Crohn's disease is currently flaring, as evidenced by the presence of ulcers during colonoscopy. This flare-up can cause intestinal inflammation, diarrhea, and malabsorption, leading"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female admit with ""blood diarrhea"" in the setting of difficult to
   control Crohn's disease.  She has had continued bleeding with
   evaluation showing source at IC junction with bleeding scan but
   negative angio and colonscopy to try to identify treatable new acute
   source of bleeding.  She has had diffuse ulcerative disease as perhaps
   most likely explanation--encouraging is the she has had no further
   acute bleeding but does retain continued slow blood loss.
   GI Bleed-
   -Patient without bowel movements since colonscopy
   -Will follow HCT q 6 hours today to assure stability

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She was admitted with ""blood diarrhea"" and continued bleeding from the ileo-colonic junction. Despite negative angiogram and colonoscopy, the patient still has slow ongoing blood loss. She has not had any further acute bleeding episodes since the colonoscopy.

The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids, along with regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has a prophylactic stress ulcer regimen consisting of pantoprazole (Protonix) and is also on antibiotics for the acute course.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122-155/61-65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no abnormalities noted on the cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal examinations. However, peripheral pulses in both upper extremities are absent.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 13.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 90 K/uL. Renal"

   bleed.
   - Heat packs to site, elevation of arm
   - Continue to monitor
   - Will discuss anticoagulation after resolution of bleed, though this
   will likely be an ongoing problem for the patient given her severe IBD.

   - Restarted on PO levothyroxine yesterday as patient is tolerating POs.
   # Hypertension: On Moexipril and Atenolol as outpatient.  Were holding
   anti-hypertensives in the setting of large GI bleed. Restarted
   antihypertensives yesterday morning as patient was persistently
   hypertensive.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Can uptitrate PO meds today if necessary

   Assessment and Plan
   61F w/ ongoing Crohn's flare refractory to steroids, undergoing Humira
   induction, with RUE DVT and persistent bloody diarrhea draining through
   rectovaginal fistula, EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] w/ TI disease w/o source of GIB,
   bleeding scan pos at ileo-cecal area but angio procedure negative with
   repeat c-scope which did not show any active sites of bleeding
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Crohn's disease wtih intermittant
   melena/hematochezia.  EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] unrevealing, tagged red scan positive
   for bleed at ileo-cecal junction but angiogram negative for active
   bleed.
   - Repeated c-scope on [**3-24**] without any active source of bleeding
   found.  No melena since procedure.  Gi recommended sending the stools
   for mycobacteria as that can cause diarrhea/melena
   - Q6 HCT drawn; stable at this time.  Patient is still hemodynamically
   stable, actually is hypertensive despite slow HCT drop
   - Repeat HCT this PM; d/w GI whether any other studies necessary; seems
   to be a fairly slow bleed.  may need capsule study to evaluate for
   small bowel AVMs or other source of bleeding
   - Will transfuse to a goal of >28 or HD instability
   # Crohn's disease: Patient is currently on Solumedrol 20 IV Q8H. No
   further imaging studies for now per GI.
   - Patient restarted on home PO meds including supplements.
   - Given a dose of MTX per GI.  Also recently started on Humira- got 2
   doses.
   - Continue TPN given short gut
   # DVT: Patient found to have RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC
   line. Unable to anticoagulate patient at this time given her active GI
   bleed.
   - Heat packs to site, elevation of arm
   - Continue to monitor
   - Will discuss anticoagulation after resolution of bleed, though this
   will likely be an ongoing problem for the patient given her severe IBD.
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient is on levothyroxine 112mcg daily as an
   outpatient.
   - Restarted on PO levothyroxine yesterday as patient is tolerating POs.
   # Hypertension: On Moexipril and Atenolol as outpatient.  Were holding
   anti-hypertensives in the setting of large GI bleed. Restarted
   antihypertensives yesterday morning as patient was persistently
   hypertensive.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Can uptitrate PO meds today if necessary
   # Osteoporosis: On Alendronate q Sunday and vitamin D/Calcium
   supplementation.
   - Continue outpatient regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with refractory Crohn's disease presenting with acute blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding. She has a history of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypothyroidism, hypertension, and osteoporosis. The patient is currently undergoing induction therapy with Humira for Crohn's disease and has previously received infliximab with allergic reactions. She is also being treated with Solumedrol, methotrexate, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to short gut syndrome.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 174/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 63 bpm. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down but stabilized at 35.5% this morning. She has received multiple blood transfusions.

The patient's physical examination reveals pale conjunctivae, normocephalic head, and normal heart sounds. Her respiratory and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. There are scars from prior surgeries present on her abdomen. Her extremities show trace edema on the right side and the left side. Neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 35.5%. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 14.1, platelet count is slightly low at 90, and creat"
