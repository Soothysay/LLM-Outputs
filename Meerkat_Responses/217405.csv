   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ a h/o CKD presents with ACS in setting of severe anemia
   likely secondary to UGI bleed.
   .
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI given lack of ST elevations on EKG, did have pain
   and positive troponins.  He is high risk and ideally would undergo
   maximal medical therapy and undergo cardiac catheterization however he
   has a high risk given large GI bleed.  In addition his symptoms began
   48 hours ago and are likely secondary to his bleed rather than plaque
   rupture.  Given bleed will need to medically manage.
   -high dose statin
   -low dose beta blocker, up titrate as tolerated
   -transfuse for hct < 30
   -start ACEi eventually when Cr stabilized and out of acute setting
   -aspirin 325mg daily
   -EKG in a.m.
   .
   # PUMP: obtain echo to evaluate EF as well as for valvular disease or
   possible complications of missed infarction.  The patient is in acute
   heart failure with signs of both L and R heart failure.  Lasix drip
   with goal diuresis 1 liter negative today.
   -continue BiPAP, with blood transfusions may need intubation if
   oxygenation worsens
   -BP currently normal, hold antihypertensives for now and start as
   needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, monitor on tele
   .
   # GI bleed: Melena with a hct drop.  Likely bleeding source, given ACS
   will have to transfuse to goal HCT of 30.
   -maintain active type and screen
   -GI consult- f/u recs
   -protonix drip at 8mg / hr
   -2 large bore IVs (has 4 PIV now)
   -other causes for anemia would be chronic or possibly hemolysis
   -having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   -? cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any further characterization,
   since then has cut down his drinking.  will send albumin.  No other
   stigmata of liver disease.  Varicies are another possible source but
   cirrhosis / portal hypertension seems unlikely
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Given GI bleed and MI / CHF likely a
   result of pre-renal causes. (bleed vs. poor forward flow from CHF)
   FENA 23.9
   -send u/a and urine lytes
   -if not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   -baseline cr from 1 year ago was 1.6
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap is 18.  Given CHF and bleed this is
   possibly due to a lactic acidosis.
   -send lactate and trend
   -glucose is 242, patient is possibly a diabetic but given this degree
   of hyperglycemia his gap is unlikely related to DKA.  F/u U/a
   -another possibility would be uremia although lactic acidosis is still
   more likely.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: possibly related to acute renal failure.
   -send p.m. hct, likely will come down with lasix drip
   -recheck p.m. potassium
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: likely as a result of acute MI however will need to
   rule out other causes.
   -f/u final read on CXR
   -send urine culture, u/a.  Blood cultures, f/u final read of CXR
   -re-culture if [**Last Name (LF) 2180**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off on antibiotics for now but did
   recieve broad spectrum abx upon initial presentation.
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   -qid finger stick glucose
   -hold oral hypoglycemics

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presents with acute coronary syndrome in the setting of severe anemia likely secondary to an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and requires maximal medical therapy and cardiac catheterization; however, the large GI bleed poses a high risk for the procedure. Therefore, the patient will be medically managed.

The assessment includes:
- Coronaries: NSTEMI due to lack of ST elevations on EKG, pain, and positive troponins. The patient is at high risk and would ideally undergo cardiac catheterization but has a large GI bleed. Medical management will be implemented.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 8L
   negative for LOS.  He has not had elevations in Cr or hypotension.
   ECHO showed no WMA or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.
   Tachycardia has generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with lasix drip with a goal of 1-2L
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.
   - Will check PA and lateral today to eval for brewing PNA that may have
   been masked by volume
   - Consider CT if worsening.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes, consider antibiotics based on CXR findings from
   today.
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 30 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Has was tachycardic since coming off BiPAP.
   Originally this was refractory to increasing doses of metoprolol from
   12.5mg TID to 75mg TID, that was done to allow for diastolic filling
   time.   His tachycardia has since improved with improving respiratory
   status, suggesting tachycardia was secondary to resp discomfort.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Given ACS transfuse to goal HCT
   of 30 with symptoms.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any
   further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Type and screen, IVs, guaiac stool
   - GI following
   - protonix PO BID
   - having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap continues to be elevated at 16 with
   normal albumin.
   - Lactate normal, no sign of ketoacidosis
   - Possibly uremia
   - ? check tox screen or osmolar gap to eval for ingestions. IE:
   Ethylene glycol -> cardiopulm failure, renal failure, AG acidosis.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, will increase to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PPI given GI bleed

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome. He likely experienced gastrointestinal bleeding leading to anemia, which then caused cardiac ischemia and tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 124/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. He is currently receiving furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 5 mg/hour and pantoprazole (Protonix) at [**2181-12-6**] 09:00 PM. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 13.3 to 15.2 thousand/mm3. His hemoglobin levels have been stable after transfusion, but his creatinine levels have increased from 2.2 to 3.0 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are elevated at 1.41. Other lab values show elevated liver enzymes, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered rales in the lungs, moderate distension of the abdomen with a palpable liver edge, and trace bilateral"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to chest pain and difficulty breathing. He has been receiving treatment with Furosemide and Pantoprazole. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/53 to 148/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for improved breathing. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,816 mL since 12 AM. The physical examination reveals scattered rales in the lungs, moderate abdominal distension with a palpable liver edge, and trace bilateral pedal edema. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, troponin T, and lactate, while other values are within normal range. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating, with the highest level at 15.2 K/uL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications due to the presence of scattered rales in the lungs, which may indicate pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac complications, given the presence of a systolic murmur and elevated troponin T levels, suggesting possible myocardial injury or heart failure.
3. Renal complications indicated by elevated creatinine levels, which may be due to acute kidney"

   24 Hour Events:
   Called out but then called back in.  Overnight developed irregular SVT,
   likely atrial tachycardia with intermittent conduction.  Received
   lopressor and dilt IV and then increased PO doses of both meds.
   Returned to NSR around midnight.  Had some leg pain, LENIs ordered.
   CXR showed no new consolidation.  PM labs repleated.  Daughter raised
   possibility of transferring back to be closer to family but agreed that
   it might be safer to keep him here.
   This morning he complains of leg pain but no chest pain, dyspnea, or

   BCX NGTD;  Chest PA/Lat: stable pulm edema, no consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 9L
   negative for LOS.  Cr is mildly elevated today but still seems to have
   fluid overload, as he stil has an O2 requirement.  ECHO showed no WMA
   or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.  Tachycardia has
   generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with decreased lasix drip rate (2.5 mg/hr)
   with a goal of -500 cc.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, DVT, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.  CXR with no evidence of new infiltrate.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes
   .
   # LEG PAIN:  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to compression from pneuomboots.  No
   swelling, but must r/o DVT.  Also possibly related to gout in setting
   of diuresis, but no evidence of joint symptoms on exam.
   - vascular ultrasound today
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 25 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had A-fib/A-flutter last night that broke with
   iincreased nodal blocking.  Will continue on increased doses of
   metoprolol 100 TID and dilt 60 mg QID, as diastolic HF not tolerant of
   A-fib.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable, although Hct is somewhat down this
   morning.  Stools remain guiac positive.  Given chest pain free, ok to
   allow Hct to drift to 25.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had
   any further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Will recheck Hct in PM
   - GI following, scope planned for monday but may need to be earlier if
   bleeding picks up.
   - protonix PO BID
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap was elevated on admission without
   significant lactare or ketones and modestly elevated BUN.  This has
   since resolved, with a gap today of 12.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, so lantus increased to 10U

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presents with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome. The patient's presentation is consistent with acute on chronic CHF, with no evidence of new infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient has been significantly diuresed, with a goal of negative 500 cc fluid balance, and continues to wean off oxygen as tolerated.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which could be due to acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, or a slowly brewing infection. Blood cultures are pending, and no antibiotics have been started yet. A vascular ultrasound has been ordered to rule out DVT.

The patient's leg pain could be secondary to compression from pneuomboots or possibly related to gout. No swelling is present, and a vascular ultrasound has been scheduled to rule out DVT.

The patient has non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, with positive troponins but no ST or T wave changes on EKG. The patient remains pain-free, and medical management with ASA, BB, and statin has been initiated. Further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT will be considered once the patient is stable.

The patient also has sinus tachycardia, which has resolved after increasing doses of metoprolol and diltiazem. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed has"

   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 30 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Has was tachycardic since coming off BiPAP.
   Originally this was refractory to increasing doses of metoprolol from
   12.5mg TID to 75mg TID, that was done to allow for diastolic filling
   time.   His tachycardia has since improved with improving respiratory
   status, suggesting tachycardia was secondary to resp discomfort.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Given ACS transfuse to goal HCT
   of 30 with symptoms.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any
   further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome. The patient's presentation is consistent with acute on chronic CHF, and he has been significantly diuresed. The ECHO showed no wall motion abnormalities or valvular disease, but impaired relaxation was noted. Tachycardia has generally resolved.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which could be a result of acute MI or a brewing infection. Blood cultures are pending, and a PA and lateral chest x-ray will be evaluated for signs of pneumonia. No antibiotics have been given yet.

Additionally, the patient experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with positive troponins but no ST or T wave changes on EKG. The patient remains pain-free, and medical management with ASA, BB, and statin has been initiated. Further diagnostic workup may be considered once stable.

Other medical complications include sinus tachycardia, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute on chronic renal failure, anion gap acidosis, hyperkalemia, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation
2. Acute coronary syndrome
3. Leukocytosis potentially due to acute MI or infection
4. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (N"
