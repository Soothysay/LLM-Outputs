   CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF
   ========================
   Ability to get patient off labetalol complicated by appearance of
   amphetamines in his toxic screen (although this may be a ""false
   positive"" from his labetalol). Will add HCTZ today. Try to wean
   labetalol. Patient had renal artery dopplers, which were negative for
   stenosis during previous admission.
   Heart rate has been well controlled in Afib.
   No evidence of CHF at this time.
   Delirium of unclear etiology. A bit better on Haldol this AM.
   Reportedly has had similar episodes in the past in hospital. Cultures
   being assessed for infection.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (afib). The patient experienced labile pressures last night, and a head CT was performed, revealing no acute changes. The patient also had two episodes of transient bradycardia, with one episode reaching the 30s.

This morning, the patient became agitated, and a toxic screen showed the presence of amphetamines. The patient has a history of allergies to lisinopril and unknown medications. They have been receiving various infusions and medications, including lorazepam, heparin sodium, and haloperidol.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted episodes of labile pressure and transient bradycardia. The flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, with a temperature range of 35.6-36.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 63-89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/51 mmHg to 223/186 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. Their eyes, head, ears, nose, and throat are all normal. The cardiovascular examination shows no murmurs, and the"

   # Hypertensive Emergency:  Did not meet goal of lowering BP by 25% over
   first 24hrs yesterday as BP very labile throughout night with
   agitation.  Cardiac enzymes neg x 3 with numerous EKGs showing a fib.
   Plan for today is transition to po meds while continuing to use the
   labetalol drip as needed.  Two episodes of bradycardia down to the 30s
   with spontaneous resolution.  Pheo workup pending.
   - check UA for proteinuria
   - serial neuro exams

   # Altered Mental Status: Very agitated overnight requiring total of
   24mg Haldol and 3mg Ativan. Psych consulted and thought this was [**2-21**]
   delirium, recommended Haldol 5mg q30min as needed to control behavior.
   Urine tox taken while inpt came back positive for amphetamines which
   was negative on ED screen.  Question possible use while inpatient or

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS), diastolic heart failure (HF), and poorly controlled hypertension. He presented with a hypertensive emergency due to non-compliance with blood pressure medications. The patient's blood pressure remains labile and has had episodes of bradycardia. He is currently agitated and requires sedation. There is a positive urine toxicology for amphetamines, which could be a false positive result or drug use while inpatient. The patient has known CAD with recent stenting, chronic diastolic HF, a seizure disorder, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and anxiety. His diabetes is currently being managed with a hold on metformin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite treatment, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This could lead to organ damage if not managed appropriately.
2. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may increase the risk of falls, self-injury, or development of pressure ulcers. Monitoring for neurologic changes and providing appropriate sedation is crucial.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia, which can be a side effect of certain medications (e.g., labetalol) used to manage hypertension. Continuous monitoring of heart rate is"

   Started CIWA with valium 5mg IV q2 as needed with 5mg Haldol PRN CIWA
   <10.  Urine tox taken while inpt came back positive for amphetamines
   which was negative on ED screen.  Question possible use while inpatient
   or false positive result (which has been documented from labetalol).
   Seems to be clearer and more comfortable this AM- wonder if this is
   resolution of possible amphetamine intox or improving delirium.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS), diastolic heart failure (HF), and poorly controlled hypertension. He presented with a hypertensive emergency after being non-compliant with his blood pressure medications for the last 24-48 hours. The patient's current condition includes agitation, labile blood pressure, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and an altered mental status with possible amphetamine intoxication or improving delirium. He has several ongoing medical issues such as CAD, chronic diastolic HF, seizure disorder, anxiety, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains labile, indicating a continued risk of hypertensive emergency. Close monitoring and management with antihypertensive medications are essential to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.

2. Pheochromocytoma (Pheo) Workup: The patient's presentation raises suspicion for pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor that can cause episodic hypertension. It is crucial to complete the pheo workup to rule out this condition and guide further management.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's agitation and altered mental status may be attributed to delirium, amphetamine intoxication, or a combination of both. Close observation and ongoing psychiatric evaluation are"

","The patient is a hypertensive, delirious, and agitated individual admitted to the ICU. They have a history of hypertension and are currently being treated with various medications including valium, haldol, hydralazine, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 163/71 mmHg to 216/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, overweight/obese, and normal pupils and sclera. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal PMI, S1, S2, and no murmurs. Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds with good air movement bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Musculoskeletal examination is unremarkable. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented but unable to assess language, purposeful movement, and no muscle wasting or paralysis.

Laboratory results indicate a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 263 K/uL, platelet count of 326 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose levels of 187 and 128 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels below 0.01. Other labs including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are also provided.

The assessment and plan include delirium/confusion, hypertension (malignant), atrial fibrillation, and the patient's blood pressure is gradually improving. Mental status has improved, and the patient is able to take oral medications and ambulate. Renal function is normal, heart rate is well-controlled in atrial fibrillation, and diuresis is being maintained. ICU care includes oral nutrition, insulin infusion for glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer, and the patient's code status is full code."
