","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and vasculopathy. She was initially admitted to the vascular service for lower extremity ulcers and developed altered mental status, respiratory failure, and persistent elevated white blood cell count. She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing blood clots below her stomach with stable blood pressure in the 90s.

The patient has multiple ongoing problems including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), vasculopathy, and chronic renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and has been hemodynamically stable. A nasogastric (NG) lavage was negative for blood, and she started on bowel prep for a colonoscopy in the ICU.

The patient has allergies to Darvon and experiences nausea/vomiting. She is currently receiving various medications including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, remeron, cipro, vancomycin, flagyl, colace, calcium acetate, nephrocaps, lipitor, insulin lantus, sliding scale insulin, zofran, and dilaudid.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/55 mmHg to 168/137 mmHg, respiratory rate of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and vasculopathy.
- She was initially admitted to the vascular service for lower extremity ulcers and developed altered mental status and respiratory failure, which improved after thoracentesis of a pleural effusion.
- She also has persistent elevated white blood cell count and was transferred to the ICU due to passing blood clots from below with stable blood pressure in the 90s.
- The patient has multiple ongoing issues including gastrointestinal bleeding (likely lower), vasculopathy, and chronic renal failure on hemodialysis.
- Overnight, the patient had persistent oozing and a cordis placement was attempted but unsuccessful in the internal jugular vein. She currently has a double-lumen PICC line and a hemodialysis line for access. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and her subcutaneous heparin was held.
- The patient has negative nasogastric lavage and started on bowel prep for colonoscopy in the ICU.
- She has allergies to Darvon (oral), nausea/vomiting, and received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/55-168/137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- She has poor dentition and peripheral pulses are absent in both upper and lower extremities, along with necrotic toes distally.
- Neurologic examination is not assessed.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactic acid levels.
- The patient is on multiple medications including remeron, cipro, vancomycin, flagyl, colace, calcium acetate, nephrocaps, lipitor, insulin, zofran, and others.
- The assessment and plan include ongoing management of gastrointestinal bleeding, leukocytosis, end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, and pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, despite receiving packed red blood cells and having a negative nasogastric lavage. Further evaluation through colonoscopy is planned.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a possible infection source. Surveillance cultures are recommended.
3. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure on hemodialysis and requires ongoing management of electrolyte imbalances and fluid balance.
4. Vasculopathy: The patient's history of vasculopathy and absent peripheral pulses suggest compromised blood flow, which can lead to further complications such as ischemia or gangrene.
5. Diabetes mellitus type 1: The patient's diabetes management is complicated by her critical illness and requires close monitoring of glucose levels.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information and may not cover all potential medical complications."

   52 yo female with PVD, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG admitted [**1-16**] to
   Vascular Surgery for bilateral lower extremity ischemia. Course
   complicated by AMS, acute respiratory failure resolved after
   thoracentesis of a pleural effusion, persistent leukocytosis.

   since this afternoon, in the setting of SVT/beta blocker. Cause likely
   multifactorial from meds/cardiac/volume depletion. Could also be septic
   given leukocytosis with concerns for infection, though timing would be
   coincidental. Plan volume resuscitation with consideration of vigileo
   to gauge fluid status, neo for MAP>65, re-trend hct

   enzymes
   2.       Junctional tachycardia/ECG changes- likely [**1-14**] demand
   ischemia. Hold B-blocker as pt
s BP didn

   consider amiodaone if tachycardia persists despite fluids
   3.       GI bleed, presumed lower source- currently without active
   bleeding
   4.       PVD- ASA/plavix/SQ heparin held during acute bleed, will
   re-start agents singly (ASA first)
   5.       Acute respiratory distress: pt previously with n
l oxygen sats
   on RA, requiring up to NRB after fluid resuscitation but weaned to
   n.c.  later this afternoon. Presumably from fluid overload. As pt is
   [**Name (NI) 329**] and has ESRD, do need to be cautious abt fluids but can continue so
   far as oxygen requirement is not too high and BP is fluid responsive.
   6.       Leukocytosis: On broad abx for \HAP, colitis, skin as
   suspected sources with ID following.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 80 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for lower extremity ulcers and developed altered mental status, respiratory failure, and persistent leukocytosis. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to rectal bleeding. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including gastrointestinal bleeding (likely lower source), vasculopathy, renal failure on chronic hemodialysis, and diabetes mellitus type 1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she experienced a significant drop after receiving metoprolol. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate volume resuscitation should be continued.
2. Junctional tachycardia/ECG changes: The patient's heart rhythm has been unstable, and there have been concerns about demand ischemia. It is important to avoid beta-blockers if they cause hypotension and consider alternative antiarrhythmic medication if necessary.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed, presumed lower source: Although the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and her hemoglobin level is stable, ongoing monitoring is required. Colonoscopy has been recommended, but the patient is refusing it.
4. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's peripheral pulses are absent in both lower extremities, indicating"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. 

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced a significant drop in blood pressure, which required urgent fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. The patient's blood pressure has been stabilized, but it remains tenuous.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The note mentions impaired skin integrity, indicating potential pressure ulcers or other skin breakdown issues. This could be due to prolonged immobility or poor tissue perfusion.

3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by hematochezia, BRBPR (blood-tinged stools), and confirmed GI bleed. The patient may require ongoing monitoring and management for this condition.

4. Junctional tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of junctional tachycardia, which is characterized by rapid heart rate originating from the junction between the atria and ventricles. This could be a response to hypotension or another underlying condition.

5. Renal impairment: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and possible interventions such as dialysis may be necessary.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged PT and PTT, suggesting a possible coagulopathy. This could increase the risk of bleeding complications.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by the presence of hematochezia, BRBPR (blood-tinged red blood cells in the urine), and negative NG lavage for blood. This could indicate ongoing bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has multiple petechiae on their upper extremities and necrotic, black, and amputated fingers and toes. These findings suggest compromised blood flow and potential tissue damage.

4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels (3.0-3.3 mg/dL) and decreased urine output indicate impaired kidney function.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PT/INR of 18.3/1.7, indicating a deficiency in blood clotting factors.

6. Infection/sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and elevated lactate level suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection and sepsis.

7. Respiratory issues: The patient has decreased lung sounds at the bases and poor inspiratory effort, which may indicate respiratory distress or pneumonia.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including gastrointestinal bleeding, type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease with previous CABG, and peripheral arterial disease. She was transferred to the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding and now presents with arrhythmia and shock.

The patient continues to have traces of blood per rectum but her hemoglobin levels are stable, making it unlikely that the bleeding is causing her unstable hemodynamic status. She has an ASA restarted yesterday but is still holding Plavix. A PICC line has been maintained, and a HD line is in place for emergencies. She requires transfusion while actively bleeding, with q6 Hcts and lactate monitoring. A GI consult has been prepared for colonoscopy while stable, to be performed in the morning. IV PPI has been initiated, and unnecessary PO medications have been held. She is NPO. Coagulation studies should be monitored, and any underlying coagulopathy should be corrected. ASA and Plavix should be held until the morning.

The patient's primary medical problem prior to transfer to the ICU was leukocytosis, with an uncertain source and no clear pattern to the white blood cell count. If she has infarcted bowel, translocation becomes a serious concern. A skin source from wounds/necrotic digits is also possible. ID recommendations should be followed, including stopping all antibiotics given no evidence of infection."

   .
   # Arrhythma and shock:  She is intermittently flipping into SVT with
   unstable BP.  In general she is quite responsive to IVF boluses (8.5L
   net in yesterday), but it remains unclear why she requires so much
   fluids.  Vasopressin seems to be working better than neosynephrine as a
   pressor.  Amiodarone loaded this morning, and she just flipped back
   into NSR.
   - wean vasopressin
   - discuss with cardiology antiarrhythmic tx
   - likely will need to start PO amiodarone later today
   - support BP with IVF and vasopressin PRN

   pressors, etc

   hypotension.  Per patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old lady with multiple medical problems, including gastrointestinal bleeding, type 1 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis, and a history of failed renal transplant. She was transferred to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding and is now experiencing arrhythmias and hypotension. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Arrhythmias: The patient is intermittently flipping into supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with unstable blood pressure. This can lead to inadequate cardiac output and organ perfusion.
2. Shock: The patient's hypotension indicates possible shock, which can compromise tissue perfusion and lead to organ dysfunction.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can cause anemia and further compromise tissue perfusion.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has multiple necrotic, black, and amputated fingers and toes, indicating compromised skin integrity. This increases the risk of infection.
5. Chronic kidney disease: The patient requires hemodialysis due to chronic kidney disease, indicating impaired kidney function. This may require careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance.
6. Type 1 diabetes mellitus: The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus, which requires careful monitoring and management of blood glucose levels.
7. Failed renal transplant: The patient's history of failed renal transplant indicates a compromised immune system, making her more susceptible to infections.
