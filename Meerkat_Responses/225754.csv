","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for the initiation of Flolan therapy. He has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, GERD, and a history of fenfluramine use. The patient is currently on various medications such as home Tracleer and sildenafil, metformin, ASA, and PPI. His vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 111/56 mmHg, heart rate of 62 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on BiPAP. The patient's lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and blood glucose levels, but are otherwise within normal limits. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient is at a higher risk of developing flash pulmonary edema due to his pre-existing COPD and diastolic dysfunction. Close monitoring of the patient's lungs is crucial when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan.
2. Overdose symptoms: Symptoms of Flolan overdose include dyspnea (shortness of breath) and palpitations. These should be monitored for closely.
3. Side effects of Flolan: Common side effects of Flolan include jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, and rash. These should also be monitored for.
4. Diarrhea: The patient already"

The patient has comorbidities including COPD, diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, GERD, and FEN.

Potential medical complications that can arise include flash pulmonary edema, which is a catastrophic event and the patient should be closely monitored when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan. The patient's existing conditions like COPD and diastolic dysfunction put him at a higher risk for this complication. Additionally, the patient's hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, GERD, and FEN require ongoing management and monitoring during his ICU stay."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension who was admitted to initiate Flolan therapy. He has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, GERD, and is also obese. The patient has been on home oxygen therapy at a rate of 3L at rest and 4L with exertion. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/56 to 133/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92% on Bipap mask. The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, but reports baseline diarrhea with three bowel movements per day. His laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, increased creatinine level, and abnormal potassium and sodium levels. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium, lisinopril, lasix, aspirin, metformin, and proton pump inhibitors. He has been instructed to continue his home regimen of Tracleer and Sildenafil, as well as his home lasix. The patient requires a surgery consult for possible Hickman placement tomorrow and will be closely monitored for any adverse effects or overdose symptoms when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan."

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension admitted to initiate Flolan therapy. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, GERD, and FEN (presumably referring to a specific condition or medication). 

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including Tracleer and Sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension, home lasix for hypertension, metformin for diabetes, insulin sliding scale, CPAP machine for sleep apnea, home oxygen therapy, PPI for GERD, and a bowel regimen as needed. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/56 mmHg to 133/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on BiPAP. 

The patient has a history of significant medical conditions, including severe pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease with known stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending artery, proximal circumflex artery, and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2-10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 38.1-39.2 g/dL, platelet count of 269-297 K/uL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, glucose of 99-118 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. 

The patient's fluid balance is negative by 710 mL, indicating net fluid loss over the past 24 hours. The patient's urine output is 950 mL, with an input of 240 mL orally and 240 mL through total fluids. 

The patient is at high risk for flash pulmonary edema, particularly given his underlying COPD and diastolic dysfunction. Close monitoring of the patient's lungs every 20 minutes when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan is recommended to watch for signs of this complication. 

The patient will be receiving education from Accredo regarding the use of Flolan, including potential side effects such as jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, rash, and symptoms of overdose related to positive inotropic effects like dyspnea and palpitations. 

The patient's code status is full code. The patient's contact information is provided for communication and notification purposes."

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension who is admitted to the ICU for the initiation of Flolan therapy. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, GERD, and FEN. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 124/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on auto CPAP. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, normal heart sounds with no murmurs, distal pulses present and palpable bilaterally, and warm skin with no rash or jaundice. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 38.1 g/dL, platelet count of 297 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and glucose level of 99 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been placed on a PA catheter, and a swan ganz catheter was placed yesterday. Insurance approval for Flolan is still pending, and the patient's daughter has requested to be present prior to starting the medication. The patient is currently on heparin prophylaxis and will continue with home medications including Tracleer, Sildenafil, lasix, lisinopril, metformin, and inhalers for COPD. The patient also has a surgery consult for a possible Hickman line placement tomorrow.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include flash pulmonary edema, which is a known risk due to the patient's COPD and diastolic dysfunction. Overdose symptoms of Flolan include dyspnea and palpitations. Common side effects of Flolan include jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, and rash. The patient will be closely monitored for any adverse effects or symptoms of overdose when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension who was admitted to initiate Flolan therapy. A right internal jugular (IJ) Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed, and the patient is awaiting insurance approval for Flolan. The most common side effects of Flolan include jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, and rash. The patient will be closely monitored for symptoms of overdose, which may include dyspnea and palpitations. Due to the patient's history of COPD and diastolic dysfunction, he is at higher risk for flash pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a higher risk of developing flash pulmonary edema due to his underlying COPD and diastolic dysfunction. This condition can be catastrophic and requires close monitoring when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan.

2. Overdose Effects: Overdose effects of Flolan can include dyspnea (shortness of breath) and palpitations. The patient will need to be monitored closely for these symptoms when initiating or increasing the dose of Flolan.

3. Hypotension: Flolan can cause hypotension (low blood pressure), which may require adjustment of the dose or additional interventions.

4. Arrhythmias: Flolan may cause arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter. The patient's heart rhythm should be monitored regularly.

5. Diarrhea and Gastrointestinal Disturbances: Fl"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of being started on a PA catheter, with records faxed to the insurance company but without approval for flolan (pulmonary team aware, spoke with patient and daughter). The patient's daughter requests her presence prior to starting the medication. The patient has no known drug allergies.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, with a maximum temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F) and a current temperature of 37°C (98.6°F). The patient's heart rate is stable at 71 bpm (with a normal range of 63-84 bpm). The blood pressure readings show a range of 124/67 mmHg to 95/51 mmHg, which falls within the normal range. The respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 11-23 breaths per minute), and the oxygen saturation is consistently above 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 107.2 kg, which is slightly lower than the admission weight of 108.7 kg. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg (with a normal range of 2-14 mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) are 54/32 mmH"

   artery
   system beyond the confines of the mediastinum. No evidence of
   pneumothorax.
   No acute focal pneumonia.

   #  Pulmonary Hypertension - admitted for initiation of Flolan. Swan
   ganz placed yesterday.  Still awaiting insurance approval for Flolan.
   Had CXR after line placement per Flolan protocol which confirmed PA
   catheter in main PA. Most common side effects with flolan are: jaw
   pain, flushing, diarrhea, rash. The overdose sxs have to do with the
   positive inotropic effects: dyspnea, palpitations. HE WILL BE AT HIGHER
   RISK OF FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA because he has COPD and some diastolic
   dysfunction.  This can be catastrophic and he should be followed very
   closely when flolan is started or dose increased.
   - continue home Tracleer and Sildenafil
   - starting dose of Flolan 2ng/kg/min, uptitrate by 2ng/kg/min every
   hour until he develops either adverse effects from the drug or symptoms
   of overdose
   - Listen to his lungs every 20 min or so when flolan is started and
   when dose is increased.
   - Teaching will be provided by Accredo: 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 7349**] or with any

   everything about epoprostenol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension admitted for the initiation of Flolan therapy. A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter was placed yesterday, and the patient is awaiting insurance approval for Flolan. Common side effects of Flolan include jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, and rash. Overdose symptoms involve positive inotropic effects such as dyspnea and palpitations. The patient has a higher risk of flash pulmonary edema due to COPD and some diastolic dysfunction. He will be closely monitored when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's history of COPD and diastolic dysfunction increases the risk of flash pulmonary edema when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan. Close monitoring is necessary.
2. Overdose Symptoms: If the patient experiences symptoms such as dyspnea and palpitations, it may indicate an overdose of Flolan.
3. Side Effects: The patient may experience common side effects like jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, and rash while taking Flolan.
4. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is currently well-controlled, it is important to continue monitoring blood pressure levels.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has known coronary artery disease with significant stenosis. Monitoring for any cardiac complications is essential.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient is on metformin at home, and insulin sliding scale"

   CXR [**2197-4-26**]
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-23**], there has been placement
   of a
   right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter that extends well into the right pulmonary
   artery
   system beyond the confines of the mediastinum. No evidence of
   pneumothorax.
   No acute focal pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   A&P:  65M with severe pulmonary hypertension electively admitted to
   initiate Flolan therapy.
   .
   #  Pulmonary Hypertension - admitted for initiation of Flolan. Swan
   ganz placed yesterday.  Still awaiting insurance approval for Flolan.
   Had CXR after line placement per Flolan protocol which confirmed PA
   catheter in main PA. Most common side effects with flolan are: jaw
   pain, flushing, diarrhea, rash. The overdose sxs have to do with the
   positive inotropic effects: dyspnea, palpitations. HE WILL BE AT HIGHER
   RISK OF FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA because he has COPD and some diastolic
   dysfunction.  This can be catastrophic and he should be followed very
   closely when flolan is started or dose increased.
   - continue home Tracleer and Sildenafil
   - starting dose of Flolan 2ng/kg/min, uptitrate by 2ng/kg/min every
   hour until he develops either adverse effects from the drug or symptoms
   of overdose
   - Listen to his lungs every 20 min or so when flolan is started and
   when dose is increased.
   - Teaching will be provided by Accredo: 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 7349**] or with any
   questions you can call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 670**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7350**], RN [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7351**]. She is a
   nurse who works for Accredo on PAH. She is very knowledgeable about
   everything about epoprostenol.
   - He does not need to be on heparin while in house because he is only
   on coumadin for PAH prophylaxis.
   - continue home lasix
   - surgery consult for possible Hickman after flolan is initiated.
   .
   #  Hypertension
 Well-controlled currently
   - Continue home regimen of lisinopril and lasix.
   .
   #  Coronary Artery Disease - Known 75% mid LAD stenosis, mild diagonal
   disease 40% proximal circumflex stenosis and a 40-50% PDA stenosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension who has been admitted to initiate Flolan therapy. A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter was placed yesterday and confirmed to be in the main pulmonary artery on chest X-ray. The patient is still awaiting insurance approval for Flolan. Common side effects of Flolan include jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, and rash. Overdose symptoms involve positive inotropic effects such as dyspnea and palpitations. The patient will be at a higher risk of flash pulmonary edema due to his COPD and diastolic dysfunction. Close monitoring is advised when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: Due to the patient's underlying COPD and diastolic dysfunction, there is a risk of developing flash pulmonary edema when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan. Close monitoring is required to promptly identify and manage this complication.

2. Overdose effects: Flolan overdose can lead to dyspnea and palpitations due to its positive inotropic effects. Regular monitoring of the patient's symptoms is necessary to detect any signs of overdose.

3. Diabetic diet and glycemic control: The patient has diabetes mellitus and is advised to start a diabetic diet. It is important to monitor his blood glucose levels and adjust the insulin sliding scale accordingly while in the hospital.

4. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension who was admitted for the initiation of Flolan therapy. He tolerated the therapy well initially but developed respiratory distress and other side effects at a dose of 6ng/kg/min, which is suggestive of flash pulmonary edema. The patient's symptoms included flushing, nausea, headache, and lightheadedness. The plan is to continue with Flolan therapy and gradually uptitrate the dose to achieve a target range of 8-12ng/kg/min. Close monitoring of lung exam and oxygenation is required. The patient will also receive teaching from Accredo regarding his medication management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient experienced respiratory distress and signs of fluid overload when the Flolan dose was increased to 6ng/kg/min. This could indicate an adverse reaction to the medication, which should be closely monitored and managed promptly.

2. Bleeding Risks: The patient is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and will require coagulation studies and platelet monitoring due to the increased bleeding risks associated with downsizing the catheter.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within the normal range, but there is a risk of hypotension with the initiation or adjustment of Flolan therapy. Close monitoring of vital signs is essential to detect and manage any changes in blood pressure.

4. Hypersensitivity Reaction: Although the patient has"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension who was admitted for the initiation of Flolan therapy. He tolerated the treatment well until reaching a dose of 6 ng/kg/min, at which point he developed respiratory distress likely due to flash pulmonary edema. He also experienced flushing, nausea, mild headache, and lightheadedness. The plan is to continue home Tracleer and Sildenafil, and continue Flolan at a reduced dose while monitoring lung exam and oxygenation closely. The patient will receive teaching from Accredo regarding epoprostenol use. He does not need to be on heparin while in the house, as he is only on Coumadin for PAH prophylaxis. The patient should continue taking home lasix, be up and chair-ambulated to monitor for symptom improvement, and if tolerating Flolan, proceed with a Hickman placement today after Flolan initiation.

   Had CXR after line placement per Flolan protocol which confirmed PA

   pain, flushing, diarrhea, rash. The overdose sxs have to do with the
   positive inotropic effects: dyspnea, palpitations. HE WILL BE AT HIGHER

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension who was admitted for the initiation of Flolan therapy. He is currently awaiting insurance approval for Flolan and has been placed on a Swan ganz catheter. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, GERD, and is currently being treated for a femoral neck fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: Due to the patient's pre-existing conditions of COPD and diastolic dysfunction, there is a risk of developing flash pulmonary edema when starting or increasing the dose of Flolan. Close monitoring is required.
2. Overdose symptoms: Overdose of Flolan can cause dyspnea and palpitations due to its positive inotropic effects. Regular monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and heart rate is necessary.
3. Side effects of Flolan: Common side effects of Flolan include jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, and rash. These side effects should be monitored and reported if they occur.
4. Hypotension: Flolan can cause hypotension, especially when initiating therapy. Close monitoring of blood pressure is required to manage this potential complication.
5. Bleeding risks: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, which carries a risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary to minimize this risk. Additionally, the downsizing of the"

   #  Pulmonary Hypertension - admitted for initiation of Flolan. Swan
   ganz placed yesterday.  Still awaiting insurance approval for Flolan.
   Had CXR after line placement per Flolan protocol which confirmed PA
   catheter in main PA. Most common side effects with flolan are: jaw
   pain, flushing, diarrhea, rash. The overdose sxs have to do with the
   positive inotropic effects: dyspnea, palpitations. HE WILL BE AT HIGHER
   RISK OF FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA because he has COPD and some diastolic
   dysfunction.  This can be catastrophic and he should be followed very
   closely when flolan is started or dose increased.
   - continue home Tracleer and Sildenafil
   - starting dose of Flolan 2ng/kg/min, uptitrate by 2ng/kg/min every
   hour until he develops either adverse effects from the drug or symptoms
   of overdose
   - Listen to his lungs every 20 min or so when flolan is started and
   when dose is increased.
   - Teaching will be provided by Accredo: 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 7349**] or with any
   questions you can call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 670**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7350**], RN [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7351**]. She is a
   nurse who works for Accredo on PAH. She is very knowledgeable about
   everything about epoprostenol.
   - He does not need to be on heparin while in house because he is only
   on coumadin for PAH prophylaxis.
   - continue home lasix
   - surgery consult for possible Hickman after flolan is initiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He was admitted for the initiation of Flolan therapy. The patient experienced side effects such as flash pulmonary edema, flushing, nausea, headache, and lightheadedness at a Flolan dose of 6ng/kg/min, which improved with diuresis and lowering of the dose. He is currently tolerating a dose of 4 ng/kg/min and will be uptitrated by 0.5 ng/kg/min every 12 hours, monitoring for adverse effects. He is also on Tracleer and sildenafil.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's condition is severe, and there is a risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension during Flolan therapy. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and hemodynamics is necessary.
2. Flolan-related Side Effects: The patient has already experienced side effects like flash pulmonary edema, flushing, nausea, headache, and lightheadedness at higher doses of Flolan. These side effects should be carefully monitored and managed during the uptitration process.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently well-controlled, but fluctuations in blood pressure may occur due to changes in medication or stress response during Flolan therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has known coronary artery"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension. He was admitted for the initiation of Flolan therapy. The patient experienced adverse effects such as flash pulmonary edema, flushing, nausea, headache, and lightheadedness at a dose of 6ng/kg/min, which improved with diuresis and lowering of the dose. He is currently tolerating a dose of 4 ng/kg/min. The plan is to uptitrate by 1 ng/kg/min every 12 hours, monitoring for any adverse effects. If the patient tolerates a higher dose with symptomatic improvement, a Hickman placement will be considered. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled and will continue with the home regimen of lisinopril and lasix. He has known coronary artery disease with 75% mid left anterior descending stenosis, mild diagonal disease, 40% proximal circumflex stenosis, and a 40-50% patent ductus arteriosus stenosis. His diabetes mellitus is well-controlled, and he will continue with the insulin secretagogue (ISS). The patient has obstructive sleep apnea and will continue with home CPAP settings. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and will continue with oxygen therapy to maintain saturation levels above 90%. The patient also has gastroesophageal reflux disease and will continue with proton pump inhibitor (P"

During the 24-hour period, the patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 88% with activity, and his Flolan dose was decreased to 4 ng/kg/min due to symptoms. The plan is to uptitrate the Flolan by 1 ng/kg/min every 12 hours and reassess for symptomatic improvement at around 8 ng/kg/min.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He is currently receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 36.9 to 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 82 and 103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 139/66 to 146/114 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12 and 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on 5 liters of oxygen. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight has decreased from 108.7 kg at admission to 107.2 kg currently. His fluid balance shows an intake of 678 mL and output of 1,730 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished male with a chief complaint of pulmonary hypertension. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 88% during activity and increased to 5 liters per minute. The patient's flolan dosage was decreased to 4 ng/kg/min, and it is planned to titrate up by 1 ng/kg/min every 12 hours. The pulmonologist reported that they cannot assess for improvement in symptoms until the patient reaches a dosage of 8 ng/kg/min, possibly by Sunday. The Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued as the numbers were not helpful.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's weight is currently 107.2 kg, down from 108.7 kg at admission. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 60/25 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 10 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 678 mL total in, with 600 mL given orally and 78 mL through intravenous fluids."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension admitted to initiate Flolan therapy. He tolerated the treatment well until reaching a dose of 6ng/kg/min, at which point he developed respiratory distress likely due to flash pulmonary edema. He also experienced flushing, nausea, and mild headache.

The plan is to continue home Tracleer and Sildenafil medications. Flolan therapy will be uptitrated by 0.5 ng/kg/min every 2-4 hours with a goal of 8-12ng/kg/min. The current dose is 7ng/kg/min. The patient's lung exam and oxygenation should be closely monitored.

The patient does not need to be on heparin while in the hospital since he is only on coumadin for PAH prophylaxis. He should continue taking home lasix and be encouraged to get up to a chair and ambulate to monitor for symptom improvement. If the patient tolerates Flolan, a Hickman placement will be arranged today after initiating Flolan.

The patient has several other medical conditions, including well-controlled hypertension, coronary artery disease with known stenosis, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, and GERD. These conditions will be managed accordingly with their respective medications.

The patient is expected to be NPO today for possible Hickman placement and possibly have the swan catheter discontinued. Fluids will be given as needed, and electrolyte repletion will be done as necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He was admitted for the initiation of Flolan therapy. However, the patient developed flash pulmonary edema with worsening oxygen requirement, leading to the decision to discontinue Flolan and downtitrate medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's severe pulmonary hypertension could lead to complications such as right heart failure, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The known 75% mid LAD stenosis, mild diagonal disease, 40% proximal circumflex stenosis, and 40-50% PDA stenosis increase the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and chest pain.
3. Diabetes Mellitus: Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to complications like diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, and long-term complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient's COPD exacerbations can lead to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and increased risk of mortality.
5. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension may result in complications like stroke, heart failure, and renal dysfunction.
6. Other Medical Conditions: The patient also has ongoing management for obstructive sleep ap"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. He was admitted for the initiation of Flolan therapy. However, the patient developed flash pulmonary edema with worsening oxygen requirement yesterday, leading to the decision to discontinue Flolan trial and downtitrate medication. Flolan is currently off, but the patient continues on Tracleer and sildenafil.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/62 mmHg to 129/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP mask. The patient appears well and shows no signs of facial flushing. 

Laboratory results indicate normal levels for hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient developed flash pulmonary edema with worsening oxygen requirement yesterday, so the decision was made to discontinue Flolan trial and downtitrate medication. Flolan is currently off, but the patient will continue on Tracleer and sildenafil. Outpatient pulmonary follow-up is planned.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with systolic blood pressure in the"

   and I agree with the documentation of the events over the past 24
   hours.  I also concur with the noted physical examination and was
   present during the assessment of its components.  The assessment and
   treatment plan as outlined above accurately reflect our plans for
   therapy over the next 24 hours.   Mr. [**Known lastname 7348**] was not able to tolerate
   Flolan therapy due to the development of pulmonary edema and systemic
   sides effects.  He has complained of a mild tingling in his fingers
   this morning but no additional associated symptoms.  He is otherwise
   back at his baseline.   We will move toward hospital discharge today
   and followup with our pulmonary consultants.  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1914**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7145**], MD

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and obesity. He was admitted for the initiation of Flolan therapy. However, he developed flash pulmonary edema with worsening oxygen requirement, leading to the decision to discontinue Flolan and downtitrate medication. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 83/62 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP. His physical examination is unremarkable, and his laboratory results show no significant abnormalities. The patient's medical conditions are well-controlled, and he is being managed with various medications and therapies for his multiple comorbidities. The plan is to continue tracleer and sildenafil, continue outpatient pulmonary follow-up, and discharge the patient home today after Cordis removal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation: The patient's worsening dyspnea and oxygen requirement suggest that he may be experiencing an exacerbation of his pulmonary hypertension. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's development of flash pulmonary edema indicates that he may be at risk for recurrent episodes, especially if his pulmonary hypertension is not adequately controlled. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and adjusting his treatment accordingly is important."
