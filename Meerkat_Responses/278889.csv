   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII,
   hypertension, AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who worsening SOB, now
   with hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   #SOB: Likely multifactorial given his extensive history. Current
   exacerbation may be due to worsening diastolic heart failure from
   possible dietary indiscretion and rapid AF decreasing diastolic filling
   time. Likely took cocaine which caused worsening AF. BNP elevated,
   weight up, and worsening CHF clinical symptoms.  OSA/OHS and pulmonary
   HTN likely also contributing to poor oxygenation and ventilation. No
   signs of infection so PNA less likely. PE a possibility with
   tachycardia and SOB. LENIS negative. However, unable to CTA given
   current respiratory status.
   -BIPAP for now for ventilation but low threshold for intubation given
   hypercarbia.
   -Check frequent ABGs, consider A-Line
   -Nitro gtt, titrate to SPB 110-140
   -IV and PO metoprolol for rate control to increase filling time
   -IV Lasix and Diuril for diuresis as he has not responded much to Lasix
   given in ED
   -Con't heparin gtt until PE evaluated and INR therapeutic
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation:
   -Heparin gtt
   -IV and PO metoprolol for rate control
   .
   #DM: Con't home lantus dose with HISS
   .
   #HTN:  Con't metoprolol and nitro gtt
   .
   #Hypercholesterolemia:  Con't statin
   .
   #Gout: no flares recently. Con't allopurinol
   .
   FEN: NPO while on mask, lytes repleted as needed, DM/low salt
   .
   PPX: Heparin gtt until patient reached therepeutic
   INR on coumadin, no PPI, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with shortness of breath and hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient experienced a code blue at 9pm due to agitation and hypercarbia. He has allergies to Capoten (Captopril) and has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, haloperidol, metoprolol, and Lasix.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/60 mmHg to 198/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 530-600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 34 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 29 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 70%.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 57 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 87 mmHg, oxygen consumption (VO2) of 40 mL/kg/min, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of 0.83.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 8.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, glucose level of 185 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and sodium level of 139 mEq/L. The patient's troponin T level is 0.03 ng/mL, lactic acid level is 2.3 mmol/L, calcium level is 9.2 mg/dL, magnesium level is 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphate level is 3.0 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals an irregular heartbeat and decreased breath sounds in the right lung base.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and decreased breath sounds in the right lung base may increase the risk of developing pneumonia.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.
   - Pt is better ventilated artificially than he normally would without
   assistance due to his chronic hypoventilation.  In order to move closer
   to ventilatory settings that he will be able to maintain unassisted, we
   will hypoventilate him Vt of 430 x ~14, while maintaining a PEEP of 26.
   - Esophageal balloon monitoring
   - Continue Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decrease compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily RSBI, SBT as able
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal again today -1 to 1.5L as BP tolerates: seemingly
   responds to Lasix 120mg IV with Diurel 500mg IV
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation.  Will
   manage as above.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.
   - Cont. to hold BB for hypotension, restart as able
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic change [**1-14**] edema and venous insufficiency.
   Would also consider cellulitis given warmth and erythema.
   - Stop Unasyn IV due to potential nephrotoxic effects and ARF.
   - Monitor for interval change.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.  Is on Warfarin for Afib, with no overt signs of

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including ischemic cardiomyopathy, respiratory acidosis, normocytic anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gout, and morbid obesity.

The patient's current condition shows that he is sedated and not responding to loud voice, intubated with an endotracheal tube, and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 120/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. He is in atrial fibrillation with a regular rapid ventricular response.

The patient has undergone several interventions including placement of an esophageal balloon for monitoring, increase in PEEP to 26 cmH2O, titration down of FiO2, administration of medications such as furosemide, heparin, pantoprazole, and midazolam, and insertion of arterial and peripheral IV lines. His laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII,
   hypertension, AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.
   - Esophageal balloon
   - Continue Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decrease compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily RSBI, SBT as able
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal -1 to 1.5L daily as BP tolerates: seemingly responds to
   Lasix 120mg IV with Diurel 500mg IV
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation.  Will
   manage as above.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.
   - Hold BB for hypotension, restart as able
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   # Anemia:  Normocytic.  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.  Is on Warfarin for Afib, with no overt signs of
   bleeding.
   - Send iron studies, B12, folate
   - Send RI
   - Send Haptoglobin, LDH
   - Guaiac stools x 3
   - Holding warfarin for potential line placement
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Metoprolol initially continued given hypertension, then discontinued
   [**1-14**] hypotension.  Warfarin also intitially continued, but held [**1-14**]
   concern for CVL placement.
   - Hold Metoprolol, monitor for rebound tachycardia on tele
   - Hold Warfarin, restart once more clinically stable
   - Would consider Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 1.6.  Could be [**1-14**]
   diuresis vs poor forward flow insetting of peri-intubation transient
   hypotension.
   - Send urine lytes/osms
   - Trend
   .
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
   - ISS
   - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Hold BB as above
   - Continue diuresis as able
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic change [**1-14**] edema and venous insufficiency.
   Would also consider cellulitis given warmth and erythema.
   - Unasyn IV
   - Monitor for interval change.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. This indicates difficulty in breathing and inadequate oxygenation.

2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, suggesting a weakened ability of the heart to pump blood efficiently.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is suffering from acute renal failure, also known as acute kidney injury (AKI). This can be inferred from the elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the lab results.

4. Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN): The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which is characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, indicating potential pressure ulcers or other skin breakdown issues.

6. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus.

7. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm.

8. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient also has chronic respiratory failure, indicating long-term difficulties in breathing.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.
   - Pt is better ventilated artificially than he normally would without
   assistance due to his chronic hypoventilation.  In order to move closer
   to ventilatory settings that he will be able to maintain unassisted, we
   will hypoventilate him Vt of 430 x ~14, while maintaining a PEEP of 26.
   - Continue Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decrease compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Trying to wean peep
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal again today -1 to 1.5L as BP tolerates: seemingly
   responds to Lasix 120mg IV with Diurel 500mg IV.  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP as serum Cr. Is increasing, which may be an effect
   of cardiac stretch beyond appropriate starling curve dynamics.
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation.  Will
   manage as above.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.
   - Cont. to hold BB for hypotension, restart as able
   - Continue aspirin

   # LE erythema: c/w chronic change [**1-14**] edema and venous insufficiency.
   Would also consider cellulitis given warmth and erythema.
   - Monitor for interval change.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.  Is on Warfarin for Afib, with no overt signs of
   bleeding.
   - Follow up iron studies, haptoglobin, RI, Haptoglobin, LDH
   - Consider obtaining a reticulocyte count.
   - Guaiac stools x 3
   - Holding warfarin for potential line placement
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Metoprolol initially continued given hypertension, then discontinued
   [**1-14**] hypotension.
   - Hold warfarin while manipulating CVL..
   - Would consider Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 1.6.  Could be [**1-14**]
   diuresis vs poor forward flow insetting of peri-intubation transient
   hypotension.
   - Send urine lytes/osms [**Hospital1 **].

   # ?Sinusitis
   - Following cultures
 if possible consider unasyn.
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, which was likely due to a combination of factors including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. The patient required mechanical ventilation and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hypotension. He has been sedated with fentanyl and midazolam for comfort. Oxygenation has been challenging, and the ventilator settings have been adjusted to provide adequate ventilation while preparing the patient for weaning off the ventilator. 

Laboratory results show anemia, elevated creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient also has evidence of chronic venous insufficiency and possible cellulitis in his lower extremities. He has been on warfarin for atrial fibrillation but will need to hold it temporarily for the central venous line placement.

The patient's renal function has worsened, and there are concerns about acute renal failure. He is being closely monitored, and diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance. Cultures have been obtained from nasal secretions due to suspected sinusitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.
   - Pt is better ventilated artificially than he normally would without
   assistance due to his chronic hypoventilation.  In order to move closer
   to ventilatory settings that he will be able to maintain unassisted, we
   will hypoventilate him Vt of 430 x ~14, while maintaining a PEEP of 26.
   - Esophageal balloon monitoring
   - Continue Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decrease compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily RSBI, SBT as able
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal again today -1 to 1.5L as BP tolerates: seemingly
   responds to Lasix 120mg IV with Diurel 500mg IV
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation.  Will
   manage as above.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.
   - Cont. to hold BB for hypotension, restart as able
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic change [**1-14**] edema and venous insufficiency.
   Would also consider cellulitis given warmth and erythema.
   - Stop Unasyn IV due to potential nephrotoxic effects and ARF.
   - Monitor for interval change.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.  Is on Warfarin for Afib, with no overt signs of
   bleeding.
   - Follow up iron studies, haptoglobin, RI, Haptoglobin, LDH
   - Consider obtaining a reticulocyte count.
   - Guaiac stools x 3
   - Holding warfarin for potential line placement
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Metoprolol initially continued given hypertension, then discontinued
   [**1-14**] hypotension.
   - Hold Warfarin [**1-14**] concern for CVL placement to be placed today
 and
   restart once he is more stable.
   - Hold Metoprolol, monitor for rebound tachycardia on tele
   - Would consider Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 1.6.  Could be [**1-14**]
   diuresis vs poor forward flow insetting of peri-intubation transient
   hypotension.
   - Send urine lytes/osms
   - Trend
   .
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS

 to tighten regimen.
   - DM TF while intubated

   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Hold BB as above
   - Continue diuresis as able
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and transferred to the MICU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. It is likely that the initial presentation was decompensated heart failure due to dietary noncompliance and beta-adrenergic stimuli from cocaine use. This could have led to pulmonary edema and hypercarbia. Acute decompensation may have occurred due to agitation, rapid breathing, and body positioning (leaning forward with decreased chest wall compliance). Oxygenation has been difficult, and the patient is currently being ventilated artificially.

2. Normocytic anemia: The patient has a chronic issue of normocytic anemia, with a slight downward trend since admission. He is on warfarin for atrial fibrillation, but there are no overt signs of bleeding. Further evaluation is needed, including iron studies, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count, and monitoring for interval change.

3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of prior myocardial infarction and is now presenting"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with severe obesity, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show an increased heart rate and blood pressure, with a slightly elevated temperature. He is on multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and others. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. To prevent this, the healthcare team should ensure proper head-of-bed elevation and follow appropriate ventilation strategies.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prolonged immobilization and obesity increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued to prevent clot formation.
3. Pressure injuries: The patient's distended abdomen and firm skin may predispose him to pressure injuries, especially if he is in the same position for an extended period. Regular repositioning and appropriate skin care are crucial to prevent skin breakdown.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned in the note, the patient has diabetes mellitus type II. It is important to monitor his blood glucose levels closely and manage"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.   Pt
   is better ventilated artificially than he normally would without
   assistance due to his chronic hypoventilation.   Was previously on
   settings of Vt 430x~ 14/min, with PEEP of 26, weaned down, now
   oxygenating at 90% with PEEP of 18, suggesting he is at threshold for
   tolerable PEEP.
   - Changed to pressure support 12, with 18 of PEEP.
   - Continue Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decrease compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Trying to wean peep
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 1L, as BP tolerates:  Decrease Lasix drip
   to 4 mg /hour.  NOTE will need to closely follow UOP.
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 1.6.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Will need gentle diuresis for respiratory issues.
   - Decrease furosemide to 4 mg/hour, continu to monitor fluid status
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 125/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Physical examination reveals sedation, symmetric pupils, distant heart sounds without murmurs, and 2-3+ edema in the lower extremities. The patient is also noted to have chronic venous stasis changes with erythema bilaterally. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, and troponin T levels. Other notable lab values include elevated blood glucose, potassium, and magnesium levels.

Assessment and plan:
The patient is being transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care. Respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.
   - Pt is better ventilated artificially than he normally would without
   assistance due to his chronic hypoventilation.   Was previously on
   settings of Vt 430x~ 14/min, with PEEP of 26, weaned down, now
   oxygenating at 90% with PEEP of 18, suggesting he is  Was changed to
   pressure support 12, with 18 of PEEP.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.
   - Pt is better ventilated artificially than he normally would without
   assistance due to his chronic hypoventilation.   Was previously on
   settings of Vt 430x~ 14/min, with PEEP of 26.  Was changed to pressure
   control with
   - Continue Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decrease compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Trying to wean peep
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal again today -1 to 1.5L as BP tolerates: seemingly
   responds to Lasix 120mg IV with Diurel 500mg IV.  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP as serum Cr. Is increasing, which may be an effect
   of cardiac stretch beyond appropriate starling curve dynamics.
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation.  Will
   manage as above.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.
   - Cont. to hold BB for hypotension, restart as able
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic change [**1-14**] edema and venous insufficiency.
   Would also consider cellulitis given warmth and erythema.
   - Monitor for interval change.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.  Is on Warfarin for Afib, with no overt signs of
   bleeding.
   - Follow up iron studies, haptoglobin, RI, Haptoglobin, LDH
   - Consider obtaining a reticulocyte count.
   - Guaiac stools x 3
   - Holding warfarin for potential line placement
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Metoprolol initially continued given hypertension, then discontinued
   [**1-14**] hypotension.
   - Hold warfarin while manipulating CVL..
   - Would consider Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 1.6.  Could be [**1-14**]
   diuresis vs poor forward flow insetting of peri-intubation transient
   hypotension.
   - Send urine lytes/osms [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # ?Sinusitis
   - Following cultures
 if possible consider unasyn.
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS

   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Hold BB as above
   - Continue diuresis as able
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.

","The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with acute shortness of breath, leading to respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for further care.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 53 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 134 mmHg.

The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with prior myocardial infarction and recent cocaine use. He is currently on beta-blockers and aspirin for his cardiovascular condition.

The patient also has leg edema with chronic venous stasis changes and erythema bilaterally, which may indicate chronic venous insufficiency. Additionally, there is a concern for cellulitis given the warmth and erythema.

The patient has normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL and a slight downward trend since admission. He is on warfarin for atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.   Pt
   is better ventilated artificially than he normally would without
   assistance due to his chronic hypoventilation.   Did not tolerate
   pressure support, with 18 of PEEP, desaturating to 80s, switched to AC
   and has tolerated well.
   - Continue Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Trying to wean peep
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 1L, as BP tolerates:  Continue Lasix drip
   to 4 mg /hour.  NOTE will need to closely follow UOP.
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Will need gentle diuresis for respiratory issues.   Diuresed
   1.3L yesterday
   - Continue furosemide to 4 mg/hour, monitor fluid status
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   -Guiaic x2
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol
   -Decrease labetalol from 7500 to 5000
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   .
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns
   - Following cultures, using Afrin and saline.
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s
   - ISS
 regimen appropriate.  Consider increasing if continues to
   increase
   - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   -Confirm nutrition plan.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.   Pt
   is better ventilated artificially than he normally would without
   assistance due to his chronic hypoventilation.   Was previously on
   settings of Vt 430x~ 14/min, with PEEP of 26, weaned down, now
   oxygenating at 90% with PEEP of 18, suggesting he is at threshold for
   tolerable PEEP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old man with morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction.
- He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial due to heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity.
- The patient's initial presentation may have been decompensated heart failure from dietary noncompliance and beta-adrenergic stimuli.
- He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation with settings of Vt 400 mL, RR 14/min, PEEP 22 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, and PS 12 cmH2O.
- The patient has been sedated with midazolam and fentanyl, and bronchodilators ipratropium and albuterol have been administered.
- Positioning has been upright to decrease chest wall and abdominal compliance.
- Daily sedation holidays have been attempted.
- Diuretics have been given to manage fluid overload, and close monitoring of urine output is necessary.
- The patient's respiratory acidosis is likely chronic hypoventilation with evidence of metabolic compensation.
- Acute renal failure has developed, with worsening renal function from 1.2 to 1.6.
- Ischemic cardiomyopathy with prior MI is present, and the patient is now also positive"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation has been difficult.   Pt
   is better ventilated artificially than he normally would without
   assistance due to his chronic hypoventilation.   Did not tolerate
   pressure support, with 18 of PEEP, desaturating to 80s, switched to AC
   and has tolerated well.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation and ventilation both
   improving with diuresis, and creatinine decreasing, suggesting patient
   has improved cardiac output due to moving on Starling curve.  Weaned
   from AC, now on PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 2L, as BP tolerates:  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Continue aspirin
   -As diuresis continues, can consider amlodipine for afterload reduction
   if pressures can tolerate it.
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol
   -Heparin has been decreased.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns.
   -Continue oxymetazoline and packing if necessary
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s
   - ISS
 regimen appropriate.  Consider increasing if continues to
   increase
   - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation and ventilation both
   improving with diuresis, and creatinine decreasing, suggesting patient
   has improved cardiac output due to moving on Starling curve.  Weaned
   from AC, now on PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 2L, as BP tolerates:  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Continue aspirin
   -As diuresis continues, can consider amlodipine for afterload reduction
   if pressures can tolerate it.
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol
   -Heparin has been decreased.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns.
   -Continue oxymetazoline and packing if necessary
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s

   - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese man with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction.
- He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity.
- Initial presentation may have been decompensated heart failure caused by dietary noncompliance and beta-adrenergic stimuli from cocaine use.
- The patient developed pulmonary edema and fluid retention, leading to hypercarbia.
- Acute decompensation may have occurred due to agitation, rapid breathing, and body positioning (leaning forward with decreased chest wall compliance).
- Oxygenation and ventilation have been improving with diuresis and decreasing creatinine levels, indicating improved cardiac output.
- The patient was initially on assisted control ventilation (AC) but has been weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- The plan is to continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
- The patient also has a respiratory acidosis, likely chronic hypoventilation with evidence of metabolic compensation.
- There is acute renal failure with an unclear baseline creatinine level, which has worsened to 2.3. Urine electrolytes and calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation may have been decompensated heart failure due to dietary noncompliance and cocaine use. This led to pulmonary edema and fluid retention, resulting in hypercarbia. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, involving heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and morbid obesity. Oxygenation and ventilation have been improving with diuresis and decreasing creatinine levels, indicating improved cardiac output.

2. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient likely has chronic hypoventilation with evidence of metabolic compensation. Management will involve continuing with the current treatment plan.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear, but it worsened from 1.2 to 2.3. Urine electrolytes and calculated FE urea suggest a pre-renal etiology. The decrease in creatinine with further diuresis is an encouraging sign, indicating improving cardiac output.

4. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and cocaine use. ACE allergy precludes the use of ACE inhibitors. Labetalol is being tolerated, and aspirin should be continued. Afterload reduction with amlodipine may be considered as diuresis continues.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with obesity hypoventilation, chronic heart failure, and type II diabetes mellitus. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 104/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 656 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 250, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished radial pulses on the right and left sides, clear breath sounds with diminished sounds at the bases, and no assessment of skin or neurologic status. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid, along with decreased levels of hemoglobin, platelets, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Oxygenation and ventilation both improving with
   diuresis, and creatinine decreasing, suggesting patient has improved
   cardiac output due to moving on Starling curve.  Weaned from AC, now on
   PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 2L, as BP tolerates:  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Fever: Possible etiologies are VAP, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  CXR without clear infiltrate; however lungs
   are better visualized due to increased lung volumes.  Significant
   pulmonary edema.
   - f/u cultures of sputum, blood, urine
   - Tylenol PRN
   - continue to trend fever curve
 will hold off on abx for now unless
   clinical picture worsens or fevers persist
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  No systemic anticoagulation; however INR is 1.7 from
   prior Coumadin use.  Pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis. No
   elevation in PTT.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.  Currently creatinine 1.8.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%.
   -Tolerating labetalol, will titrate up.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Will use Losartan, starting tomorrow.  Pt received Amlodipine today
   already but would not continue this medication as problem is diastolic,
   not systolic dysfunction and would not benefit from afterload
   reduction.
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns.  Sinusitis appears
   improved.
   -Continue oxymetazoline and packing if necessary
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s
   - ISS
 regimen appropriate.  Consider increasing if continues to
   increase
   - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, for which he was intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving with diuresis and decreasing creatinine levels, indicating improved cardiac output. The plan is to continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be due to various causes such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection, or blood infection. Further evaluation with cultures and ongoing monitoring is recommended.
3. Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing nosebleeds and hematuria. Since the patient is on heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, it is important to closely monitor for any signs of bleeding.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened since admission, but there are encouraging signs of improvement with ongoing diuresis. The creatinine level is currently 1.8.
5. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and is now showing signs of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The plan includes titrating labetalol"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial in the setting of heart
   failure, pulmonary HTN, OSA and morbid obesity.  Initial presentation
   may have been [**1-14**] decompensated heart failure from dietery
   noncompliance (sardines) and beta adrenergic stimuli [**1-14**] cocaine use.
   This likely led to pulmonary edema [**1-14**] fluid retention with resultant
   hypercarbia.  Acute decompensation may have occured [**1-14**] agitation,
   rapid breathing and then body positioning (leaning forward with
   decreased chest wall compliance).  Oxygenation and ventilation both
   improving with diuresis, and creatinine decreasing, suggesting patient
   has improved cardiac output due to moving on Starling curve.  Weaned
   from AC, now on PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 2L, as BP tolerates:  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Continue aspirin
   -As diuresis continues, can consider amlodipine for afterload reduction
   if pressures can tolerate it.
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol
   -Heparin has been decreased.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns.
   -Continue oxymetazoline and packing if necessary
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s
   - ISS
 regimen appropriate.  Consider increasing if continues to
   increase
   - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction.
- He presented with acute shortness of breath, leading to respiratory failure.
- Initial presentation may have been decompensated heart failure due to dietary noncompliance and beta adrenergic stimuli (cocaine use).
- Acute decompensation may have occurred due to agitation, rapid breathing, and body positioning (leaning forward with decreased chest wall compliance).
- Oxygenation and ventilation have been improving with diuresis, suggesting improved cardiac output.
- The patient was weaned from assisted ventilation to partial support ventilation and is gradually decreasing PEEP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial in the setting of heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity.
2. Respiratory Acidosis: There is evidence of chronic hypoventilation with metabolic compensation. Management should focus on improving ventilation and oxygenation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened from baseline, suggesting pre-renal etiology. Close monitoring of urine output and further diuresis is recommended.
4. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Likely due to morbid obesity and diastolic heart
   failure, patient positive many liters. Oxygenation and ventilation both
   improving with diuresis, creatinine increased briefly but has again
   decreased, likely due to improvement in cardiac hemodynamics.  Weaned
   from AC, now on PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.  Patient likely
   suffers from respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation on
   chronic basis.
   - Continue weaning PEEP by 1 mm Hg as diuresis continues.
   -Diurese 1.5-2 L as tolerated.  Likely transition to Lasix boluses
   tomorrow.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   -wean PEEP by 1
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   # Fever:  Today is febrile with white count.  Possible etiologies are
   VAP, sinusitis, line infections, with urinary tract infection, skin
   infection at penile tip, and drug effect less likely.  CXR appears to
   be improving, but imaging is poor and significant edema remains
   - f/u cultures of sputum, blood, urine
   -C. diff toxin
   - Tylenol PRN
   - continue to trend WBC, fever curve
   -vancomycin/Unasyn
 vancomycin for prolonged hospitalization and
   potential line infection/ventilator associated pneumonia.  Unasyn to
   cover sinusitis and some GNRs.  If patient worsens, new infiltrate on
   CXR, or positive sputum cx, consider switching to Zosyn.
   #Sinusitis-improving, Unasyn as above
   -Continue oxymetazoline and packing if necessary
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM, likely due to Foley trauma.  No systemic
   anticoagulation; however INR is 1.5 from prior Coumadin use.  Pt is
   getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  [**Month (only) 60**] need lines replaced and
   new lines placed [**1-14**] infection, so will not be heparinized at this time
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding
   - hold on heparinization for now
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.  Currently creatinine 1.8.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%.  Afterload reduction less important in this patient, as most of
   patient
s failure is diastolic dysfunction.
   -Tolerating labetalol, will titrate up.
   - Continue aspirin
   -Given slight increase in creatinine and continuing aggressive
   diuresis, hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**].
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Bacterial cellulitis very unlikely, as legs are
   improving, symmetric, and edema improving.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s
   - ISS
 regimen appropriate.  Consider increasing if continues to
   increase
   - DM TF while intubated
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   -Nutrition consult post-ventilation
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.  [**Month (only) 60**]

","The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. He was intubated and transferred to the MICU for further care.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. His oxygenation and ventilation are improving with diuresis, suggesting that his cardiac hemodynamics are improving. The plan is to continue weaning PEEP by 1 mm Hg as diuresis continues, diurese 1.5-2 L as tolerated, transition to Lasix boluses tomorrow, and continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component.

2. Fever: The patient is febrile with a white blood cell count. Possible etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, line infections, urinary tract infection, skin infection at the penile tip, and drug effect. The plan is to follow cultures of sputum, blood, and urine, trend WBC, fever curve, and administer Tylenol PRN. Vancomycin and Unasyn have been started for coverage against potential line infection and VAP.

3. Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing nosebleeds and hematuria. The hematuria"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Oxygenation and ventilation both improving with
   diuresis, creatinine increased briefly but has again decreased, likely
   due to improvement in cardiac hemodynamics.  Weaned from AC, now on
   PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.
   - Continue weaning PEEP by 1 mm Hg as diuresis continues.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   -wean PEEP by 1
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 2L, as BP tolerates:  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Fever: Possible etiologies are VAP, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  CXR without clear infiltrate; however lungs
   are better visualized due to increased lung volumes.  Significant
   pulmonary edema.
   - f/u cultures of sputum, blood, urine
   - Tylenol PRN
   - continue to trend fever curve
 will hold off on abx for now unless
   clinical picture worsens or fevers persist
   .-stool C. diff toxin
   -vancomycin/Unasyn
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  No systemic anticoagulation; however INR is 1.7 from
   prior Coumadin use.  Pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis. No
   elevation in PTT.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.  Currently creatinine 1.8.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%.
   -Tolerating labetalol, will titrate up.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Will use Losartan, starting tomorrow.  Pt received Amlodipine today
   already but would not continue this medication as problem is diastolic,
   not systolic dysfunction and would not benefit from afterload
   reduction.
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns.  Sinusitis appears
   improved.
   -Continue oxymetazoline and packing if necessary
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s
   - ISS
 regimen appropriate.  Consider increasing if continues to
   increase
   - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

   Q
","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure. The progress note indicates that the patient's oxygenation and ventilation are improving with diuresis, and they have been weaned from assisted ventilation to CPAP/PSV mode. However, continuous monitoring is necessary to prevent any further deterioration.

2. Fever: The patient has been febrile during the day, with a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Possible etiologies for the fever include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection, or blood infection. The absence of clear infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggests that VAP might be less likely, but it cannot be ruled out completely. Cultures of sputum, blood, and urine have been obtained to identify the source of infection.

3. Bleeding: The patient has experienced nosebleeds and hematuria. Although no systemic anticoagulation is currently being administered, the patient's INR is elevated due to prior Coumadin use. The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, but the bleeding needs to be closely monitored.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear, but it has increased from 1.2 to 2.3. The urine electrolytes and calculated"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, for which he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient has shown improvement in oxygenation and ventilation, with decreasing PEEP and weaning from assisted ventilation. His cardiac output seems to be improving as well, as indicated by the decreasing creatinine level. The plan is to continue weaning the patient off ventilation and diurese him to maintain a goal output of -2 liters per day.

The patient also has a fever, which could be due to various causes such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection. The chest X-ray does not show clear infiltrates, but the lungs appear better visualized due to increased lung volumes. There is significant pulmonary edema present. Further cultures have been obtained, and Tylenol has been given as needed. The decision to initiate antibiotics will depend on the clinical picture and persistence of fevers.

The patient has been experiencing nosebleeds and hematuria, but the hematuria has resolved. He is not on systemic anticoagulation, but his INR is 1.7 from prior Coumadin use. He is receiving subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. There is no elevation in PTT.

The patient has chronic hypoventilation with evidence of metabolic compensation, and his respiratory acidosis is being managed accordingly. His renal function has worsened from a baseline of approximately 1.2 to 2.3, but it is improving with further diuresis. This suggests improving cardiac output. The plan is to continue Lasix as above to achieve a goal output of -2 liters per day.

The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, with a prior myocardial infarction and positive cocaine on the toxin screen. He is intolerant to ACE inhibitors and is being titrated up on labetalol. He will also receive aspirin and start on losartan tomorrow. Amlodipine was already administered but will not be continued as the problem is diastolic dysfunction, not systolic dysfunction.

The patient has chronic stasis dermatitis with erythema and edema in the lower extremities, which is improving. Cellulitis is less likely, but should be considered if the patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever, or white blood cell count.

The patient has normocytic anemia, which appears to be a chronic issue with a downward trend since admission. Iron studies are inconclusive, with low reticulocyte count suggesting a mild production problem. The ferritin level is elevated as an acute-phase reactant, and the patient is not hemolyzing"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Oxygenation and ventilation both improving with
   diuresis, and creatinine decreasing, suggesting patient has improved
   cardiac output due to moving on Starling curve.  Weaned from AC, now on
   PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   -wean PEEP by 1
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 2L, as BP tolerates:  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Fever: Possible etiologies are VAP, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  CXR without clear infiltrate; however lungs
   are better visualized due to increased lung volumes.  Significant
   pulmonary edema.
   - f/u cultures of sputum, blood, urine
   - Tylenol PRN
   - continue to trend fever curve
 will hold off on abx for now unless
   clinical picture worsens or fevers persist
   .-stool C. diff toxin
   -vancomycin/Unasyn
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  No systemic anticoagulation; however INR is 1.7 from
   prior Coumadin use.  Pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis. No
   elevation in PTT.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.  Currently creatinine 1.8.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%.
   -Tolerating labetalol, will titrate up.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Will use Losartan, starting tomorrow.  Pt received Amlodipine today
   already but would not continue this medication as problem is diastolic,
   not systolic dysfunction and would not benefit from afterload
   reduction.
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns.  Sinusitis appears
   improved.
   -Continue oxymetazoline and packing if necessary
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Oxygenation and ventilation both improving with
   diuresis, creatinine increased briefly but has again decreased, likely
   due to improvement in cardiac hemodynamics.  Weaned from AC, now on
   PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.
   - Continue weaning PEEP by 1 mm Hg as diuresis continues.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   -wean PEEP by 1
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 2L, as BP tolerates:  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Fever: Possible etiologies are VAP, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  CXR without clear infiltrate; however lungs
   are better visualized due to increased lung volumes.  Significant
   pulmonary edema.
   - f/u cultures of sputum, blood, urine
   - Tylenol PRN
   - continue to trend fever curve
 will hold off on abx for now unless
   clinical picture worsens or fevers persist
   .-stool C. diff toxin
   -vancomycin/Unasyn
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  No systemic anticoagulation; however INR is 1.7 from
   prior Coumadin use.  Pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis. No
   elevation in PTT.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.  Currently creatinine 1.8.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%.
   -Tolerating labetalol, will titrate up.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Will use Losartan, starting tomorrow.  Pt received Amlodipine today
   already but would not continue this medication as problem is diastolic,
   not systolic dysfunction and would not benefit from afterload
   reduction.
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns.  Sinusitis appears
   improved.
   -Continue oxymetazoline and packing if necessary
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s
   - ISS
 regimen appropriate.  Consider increasing if continues to
   increase
   - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, heart failure (diastolic), chronic respiratory failure, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a pressure support of 16 cmH2O, PEEP of 18 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on 10/16/2141 at 11:52 AM and 10/17/2141 at 02:30 AM. Stool and urine cultures were also obtained on 10/16/2141 at 11:52 AM. The patient is receiving IV antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn). The patient is being weaned off the ventilator but experiences desaturation with PEEP of 13, requiring an increase to PEEP of 14 and then 16. The patient's oxygen saturation drops to mid-80s when rolled to the right side, but stabilizes after recruiting maneuvers with PSV of 16/18. The patient has a history of nosebleeds, and a significant amount of blood was swallowed. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,991 mL and a total output of 3,470 mL since 12 AM. The patient's blood products, urine output, and NG output are all within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, ranging from 158 to 172 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 12.1 K/uL, with a range of 13.7 K/uL. Other lab results show abnormalities in potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 64 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 166. The patient's chest X-ray from 10/15/2141 shows evidence of bilateral infiltrates. The patient's clinical problems include fever of unknown origin, obesity, respiratory failure, heart failure, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Patient had mild setback yesterday, with
   worsening oxygenation.  Patient improved with increase in PEEP, but
   should continue weaning.  Continued diuresis also important.  Weaned
   from AC to PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.  Pt not eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   -Goal of 2L per day
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 2L, as BP tolerates:  NOTE will need to
   closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   Possible etiologies are VAP, urinary tract infection, blood infection,
   drug effect.  CXR without clear infiltrate; however lungs are better
   visualized due to increased lung volumes.  Significant pulmonary edema.
   - f/u cultures of sputum, blood, urine
   - Tylenol PRN
   - continue to trend fever curve
 will hold off on abx for now unless
   clinical picture worsens or fevers persist
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  No systemic anticoagulation; however INR is 1.7 from
   prior Coumadin use.  Pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis. No
   elevation in PTT.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis: Likely [**1-14**] chronic hypoventilation, with
   evidence of metabolic compensation.  Will manage as above.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.  Currently creatinine 1.8.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%.
   -Tolerating labetalol, will titrate up.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Will use Losartan, starting tomorrow.  Pt received Amlodipine today
   already but would not continue this medication as problem is diastolic,
   not systolic dysfunction and would not benefit from afterload
   reduction.
   .
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Seemingly a chronic issue, with slight downward
   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase
   reactant.  Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns.  Sinusitis appears
   improved.
   -Continue oxymetazoline and packing if necessary
   - Trending fever curve and WBCs.
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s
   - ISS
 regimen appropriate.  Consider increasing if continues to
   increase
   - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensiven then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, for which he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient's recent events include desaturation with PEEP of 13, requiring an increase in PEEP to 14 and then 16. He also experienced a drop in oxygen saturation when rolled to his right side, but stabilized after recruiting maneuvers with pressure support ventilation (PSV) set at 16/18. 

Cultures were obtained, including blood cultures at 11:52 AM on 10/16 and 2:30 AM on 10/17, as well as stool and urine cultures at 11:52 AM on 10/16. The patient was re-cultured at 4:00 AM on 10/17.

The patient has allergies to Capoten and experiences cough as an adverse effect. He was receiving Vancomycin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn), both discontinued as per the note.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F (39.1°C), heart rate of 91 bpm (with atrial fibrillation), blood pressure ranging from 110/65 mmHg to 163/92 mmHg,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Patient had mild setback yesterday, with
   worsening oxygenation.  Patient improved with increase in PEEP, but
   should continue weaning.  Continued diuresis also important.  Weaned
   from AC to PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.  Pt not eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   -Goal of 1.5-2L per day
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 1.5-2L, as BP and creatinine tolerate:
   NOTE will need to closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Started PO Flagyl.  Bowel involvement and ileus may be
   responsible for regurgitation.  Other possible etiologies are VAP,
   urinary tract infection, blood infection, drug effect.
   - f/u cultures of sputum, blood, urine.  If cx are negative, d/c
   vanc/Unasyn
   - Tylenol PRN
   - continue to trend fever curve
 will hold off on abx for now unless
   clinical picture worsens or fevers persist
   -may need an enema today
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by  acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue free water tube feeds
   -re-check sodium in PM.  If 155 or greater, begin D5W drips.
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
   No elevation in PTT.
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   ..
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.  Currently creatinine 1.9.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.
   -Tolerating labetalol, will titrate up.  Reasonably well-controlled
   currently.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.  If patient requires D5W, will make
   glycemic control more complicated.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s.
   - ISS
 Increased Lantus - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation not
   indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Patient had mild setback yesterday, with
   worsening oxygenation.  Patient improved with increase in PEEP, but
   should continue weaning.  Continued diuresis also important.  Weaned
   from AC to PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.  Pt not eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   -Goal of 1.5-2L per day
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 1.5-2L, as BP and creatinine tolerate:
   NOTE will need to closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Started PO Flagyl.  Bowel involvement and ileus may be
   responsible for regurgitation.  Other possible etiologies are VAP,
   urinary tract infection, blood infection, drug effect.
   - f/u cultures of sputum, blood, urine.  If cx are negative, d/c
   vanc/Unasyn
   - Tylenol PRN
   - continue to trend fever curve
 will hold off on abx for now unless
   clinical picture worsens or fevers persist
   -may need an enema today
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by  acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue free water tube feeds
   -re-check sodium in PM.  If 155 or greater, begin D5W drips.
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
   No elevation in PTT.
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   ..
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.  Currently creatinine 1.9.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.
   -Tolerating labetalol, will titrate up.  Reasonably well-controlled
   currently.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.  If patient requires D5W, will make
   glycemic control more complicated.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s.
   - ISS
 Increased Lantus - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation not
   indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. He presents with acute shortness of breath, resulting in respiratory failure and subsequent transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient has been experiencing various complications during his ICU stay, including worsening oxygenation, fever, hypernatremia, bleeding, normocytic anemia, acute renal failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, lower extremity erythema, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gout, and morbid obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had mild setbacks with worsening oxygenation, but improved with increased PEEP. Continued diuresis and weaning of ventilation are important to prevent further respiratory issues.
2. Fever: The patient has been febrile, with positive C. diff toxin, indicating a potential source of infection. Bowel involvement and ileus may be responsible for regurgitation. Other possible etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection, blood infection, or drug effect.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia due to free water loss caused by Lasix, which impairs kidney concentrating ability. Free water tube feeds will be continued, and sodium levels will be"

   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count

   trend since admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low
   reticulocyte count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild
   iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase

   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # ?Sinusitis- held Unasyn for renal concerns.  Sinusitis appears
   improved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with acute shortness of breath, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation and ventilation are improving with diuresis, suggesting an improvement in cardiac output. However, continuous monitoring and weaning of PEEP and ventilation should be done as diuresis continues.
2. Fever: Possible etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection, blood infection, or drug effect. Further evaluation of cultures and close monitoring of the fever curve are necessary.
3. Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing nosebleeds and hematuria. Despite no systemic anticoagulation, the INR is elevated from prior Coumadin use. The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Regular monitoring of hematocrit and bleeding should be done.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline renal function is unclear, but it appears to have worsened from 1.2 to 2.3. Urine electrolytes and calculated FE urea suggest a pre-renal etiology. Decreasing creatinine levels with further diuresis indicate improving cardiac output."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Switched to IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin, PR vancomycin.
   Patient at risk for severe infection.   CT imaging is indicated to
   evaluate degree of disease and other intra-abdominal pathology, but
   patient may not be candidate for CT given size, and portable xray
   machine does not have radiation necessary to penetrate patient
   abdomen sufficiently for KUB.  Other possible etiologies are less
   likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.
   -ID approval for PR vanco
   -d/c vancomycin/Unasyn
   -CT contrast with PO but no IV contrast, ask CT services to measure his
   abdominal girth to see if he can fit inside machine.
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning
   down again. Although continued diuresis is important, given infection
   and creatinine bump, should hold Lasix for now.  Pt not eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   -Hold Lasix drip for now, consider restarting after PM lytes and
   improving renal function
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able.
   -PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Has bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue D5W drip, check PM lytes, and if Na less than or equal to
   140, d/c free water.
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
   -Continue packing sinuses with oxymetazoline soaked gauze..
   -d/c ASA [**1-14**] bleeding
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - d/c ASA [**1-14**] bleeding
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient. Requiring D5W
   -Insulin drip
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   .
   #Respiratory failure:  Patient had mild setback yesterday, with
   worsening oxygenation.  Patient improved with increase in PEEP, but
   should continue weaning.  Continued diuresis also important.  Weaned
   from AC to PSV, with gradually decreasing PEEP.  Pt not eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   -Goal of 1.5-2L per day
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able
   - Diurese, goal today max of 1.5-2L, as BP and creatinine tolerate:
   NOTE will need to closely follow UOP.
   -PM lytes
   .
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Started PO Flagyl.  Bowel involvement and ileus may be
   responsible for regurgitation.  Other possible etiologies are VAP,
   urinary tract infection, blood infection, drug effect.
   - f/u cultures of sputum, blood, urine.  If cx are negative, d/c
   vanc/Unasyn
   - Tylenol PRN
   - continue to trend fever curve
 will hold off on abx for now unless
   clinical picture worsens or fevers persist
   -may need an enema today
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by  acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue free water tube feeds
   -re-check sodium in PM.  If 155 or greater, begin D5W drips.
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
   No elevation in PTT.
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   ..
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Decrease in creatinine with further diuresis encouraging sign,
   suggesting improving cardiac output.  Currently creatinine 1.9.
   - Continue Lasix as above to goal of -2L/day
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.
   -Tolerating labetalol, will titrate up.  Reasonably well-controlled
   currently.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient.  If patient requires D5W, will make
   glycemic control more complicated.
   - QID FS
 which have been moderately elevated in 130s to 150s.
   - ISS
 Increased Lantus - DM TF while intubated
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation not
   indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. He presents with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, for which he has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 50%, and PEEP 17 cmH2O. His oxygenation has improved, but there is a concern for worsening oxygenation. The plan is to continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues. He should be positioned upright to minimize chest wall and abdominal compliance.

2. Fever: The patient has a fever of 103.0 F and has tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin. This suggests an infection as the source of the fever. The patient has started receiving oral Flagyl to treat C. diff-associated diarrhea. Other potential causes of fever include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection, blood infection, or drug effects. Further cultures should be obtained, and if the chest X-ray is negative, the antibiotics can be discontinued.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to the diuretic Lasix, which impairs kidney"

   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Switched to IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin, PR vancomycin.
   Patient at risk for severe infection.   CT imaging is indicated to
   evaluate degree of disease and other intra-abdominal pathology, but
   patient may not be candidate for CT given size, and portable xray
   machine does not have radiation necessary to penetrate patient
   abdomen sufficiently for KUB.  Other possible etiologies are less
   likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.
   -ID approval for PR vanco
   -d/c vancomycin/Unasyn
   -CT contrast with PO but no IV contrast, ask CT services to measure his
   abdominal girth to see if he can fit inside machine.
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning
   down again. Although continued diuresis is important, given infection
   and creatinine bump, should hold Lasix for now.  Pt not eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   -Hold Lasix drip for now, consider restarting after PM lytes and
   improving renal function
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]

   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able.
   -PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Has bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes.

   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   -Tolerating labetalol

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) where he is being treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which has caused fever. 

The patient's respiratory status is of concern as indicated by his low oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels and the need for mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The PEEP has been gradually decreased, but the patient is still dependent on the ventilator. 

The patient also has acute renal failure, as evidenced by an increase in creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). The cause of the renal failure is unclear, but it may be due to sepsis secondary to the C. diff infection or pre-renal causes. 

There is mention of the patient's bleeding issues, including nosebleeds and hematuria. These symptoms could be attributed to his use of aspirin (ASA) or possibly due to his anticoagulation therapy. 

The patient has normocytic anemia, which is a chronic condition. Iron studies show mixed results, suggesting a mild production problem. 

In terms of cardiovascular health, the patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  LFTs significant for mild bump in AST and mild elevation in
   Alk Phos, raising possibility of biliary disease.   Other possible
   etiologies are less likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract
   infection, blood infection, drug effect.
   -Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Given
   improved renal function and yesterday +2L volume status, will resume
   diuresis.   Pt not eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk
   associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient
   to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   -Re-start Lasix drip, with goal to diuresis 1-3L as renal function
   tolerates
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able.
   -PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection, but  has now improved
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue D5W drip, check PM lytes, and if Na less than or equal to
   140, d/c free water drip
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT
   prophylaxis.  ENT cauterized bleeding sites.
   -Continue packing sinuses with oxymetazoline soaked gauze..
   - consider re-starting ASA after 48 hours without re-bleeding
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with acute shortness of breath, leading to respiratory failure and subsequent transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 15 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. He has been diagnosed with Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection and is being treated with oral and rectal vancomycin, as well as intravenous Flagyl. 

The patient has a history of morbid obesity, which is believed to be contributing to his respiratory failure. His renal function has improved, but he remains oliguric with a serum creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 145 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia. He also has a fever, which is likely due to the C. diff infection. 

Other issues include nosebleeds, for which the bleeding sites were cauterized, and a history of hematuria that has since resolved. The patient has normocytic anemia with a slight downward trend since admission. His ischemic cardiomyopathy is well-documented, and he has been started on labetalol for rate control.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  LFTs significant for mild bump in AST and mild elevation in
   Alk Phos, raising possibility of biliary disease.   Other possible
   etiologies are less likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract
   infection, blood infection, drug effect.
   -Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Given
   improved renal function and yesterday +2L volume status, will resume
   diuresis.   Pt not eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk
   associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient
   to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   -Re-start Lasix drip, with goal to diuresis 1-3L as renal function
   tolerates
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able.
   -PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection, but  has now improved
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue D5W drip, check PM lytes, and if Na less than or equal to
   140, d/c free water drip
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT
   prophylaxis.  ENT cauterized bleeding sites.
   -Continue packing sinuses with oxymetazoline soaked gauze..
   - consider re-starting ASA after 48 hours without re-bleeding
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient. Requiring D5W
   -Insulin drip
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation not
   indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequently developed respiratory failure. He is now being transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

The patient has a fever and is being treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection with oral and rectal vancomycin, as well as intravenous Flagyl. He was restarted on tube feeds but they were stopped due to a bleeding issue. He also has a history of nosebleeds, which were chemically cauterized by the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) department. He is recommended to use saline nasal spray and Bactroban ointment.

The patient's PEEP has been decreased from 16 to 15, and his oxygen saturation (O2 sat) is 88-90%. He is still hypernatremic but receiving free water boluses, with the goal of correcting his sodium levels.

His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). He has anemia and a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy. His medications include fentanyl, insulin, midazolam, and various other ICU medications.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a respiratory"

","The patient's chief complaint includes poor stooling, necessitating an increase in PEEP to 18 due to desaturation, fever, and a negative fluid balance. The patient has a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and has been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

The patient's fever is likely due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin, which suggests an infection as the source. Other possible etiologies for the fever include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood infection, or drug effect. The patient is being treated with IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin.

The patient has respiratory failure with underlying causes such as congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and morbid obesity. The PEEP was increased and then weaned down again. The goal is to resume diuresis, but the patient is not eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and the associated risk of gastrostomy tube placement. The plan is to continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues, restart the Lasix drip with a goal to diuresis 1-3 liters as renal function tolerates, continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  LFTs significant for mild bump in AST and mild elevation in
   Alk Phos, raising possibility of biliary disease.   Other possible
   etiologies are less likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract
   infection, blood infection, drug effect.
   -Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Given
   improved renal function and yesterday +2L volume status, will resume
   diuresis.   Pt not eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk
   associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient
   to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   - Continue weaning PEEP and ventilation as diuresis continues.
   -Re-start Lasix drip, with goal to diuresis 1-3L as renal function
   tolerates
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen

   - Daily sedation holidays as able.
   -PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection, but  has now improved
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue D5W drip, check PM lytes, and if Na less than or equal to
   140, d/c free water drip
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT
   prophylaxis.  ENT cauterized bleeding sites.
   -Continue packing sinuses with oxymetazoline soaked gauze..
   - consider re-starting ASA after 48 hours without re-bleeding
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient. Requiring D5W

   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure and is being treated for various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever of 101.6°F and a positive C. diff toxin, suggesting a possible source of infection. The physician has ordered IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin to continue treating the infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to factors such as CHF, fluid overload, and morbid obesity. The physician plans to wean the patient off ventilation and decrease PEEP levels as renal function and volume status improve.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened from a baseline of approximately 1.2 to 2.3. The physician suspects a pre-renal etiology and plans to monitor the patient's electrolytes and consider further diagnostic tests if necessary.

4. Hypernatremia: The use of lasix, which acts on the ascending loop of Henle, has caused the patient to develop hypernatremia due to greater free water loss than sodium loss. The physician has ordered a D5W drip to address this issue.

5. Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing nose"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of poor stooling. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and allergies to Capoten (captopril). The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.6°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 112/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, PEEP of 18 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a respiratory support device. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of -345 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has received multiple infusions of insulin, fentanyl, midazolam, and furosemide. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted fever. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet levels, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. Further investigation is needed through blood cultures and urine cultures.
2. Fluid overload: Despite the net negative fluid balance, the patient's CVP remains high at 17 mmHg, indicating potential fluid overload. Close"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Patient remains febrile, which is somewhat worrisome, but
   white count is trending down.  AST/Alk phos elevation most likely [**1-14**]
   CHF and increased venous pressure.   Other possible etiologies are less
   likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  Given that cultures have not yet been
   fruitful, will hold cultures for QOD.  Finally, diff shows borderline
   eosinophilia.  If worsens, may increase suspicion of drug fever.
   -Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Given
   improved renal function and yesterday +2L volume status, will resume
   diuresis.   Pt not eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk
   associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient
   to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   -Wean PEEP, tolerating O2 sat of 88-89%
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   -Begin using fentanyl patch at 100 and klonopin 1mg tid for sedation .
   -Goal of 1 to 2 L, with negative balance each hour
   -Avoid increasing Lasix above 10 mg IV per hour.
   -Add metolazone for additional diuresis
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able.
   -PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection, but  has now improved.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney

   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT
   prophylaxis.  ENT cauterized bleeding sites.
   -Continue packing sinuses with oxymetazoline soaked gauze..
   - consider re-starting ASA after 48 hours without re-bleeding
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, which has since been complicated by various issues.

24-hour events:
- Restarted lasix drip to achieve a negative fluid balance
- Poor stooling, necessitating an increase in PEEP to 18 due to desaturation
- Fever of 101.6°F
- Fluids: Net intake of -0.15L

The patient has ongoing fevers, and cultures were obtained for blood and urine. His current vital signs include a temperature of 100.4°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 112/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, using an endotracheal tube with a tidal volume of 402 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Physical examination findings include decreased proptosis, mild desquamation of skin around the medial eyebrows, large neck, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, soft and distended abdomen, warm skin with 2+ pitting edema bilaterally, and normal"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 53 yo M  with morbid obesity (BMI>50), DM,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI with acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF transferred
   to MICU with volume overload and respiratory failure. HC c/b c. diff,
   persistent fevers, episodic renal insufficiency. CT without ileus, SBO,
   or perforation. Failed to tolerate PEEP wean, ongoing FW repletion.
   Exam notable for Tm 101.2   BP 115/71 HR 95/AF RR 14-28 with sat 98 on
   PSV 12/16 FiO2 0.5 -> 7.38/58/104. CVP 30. Obese man, NAD on vent.
   distant BS, distant HS RR. Obese, + bowel sounds. + skin blistering,
   decreased edema at LE. Labs notable for WBC 9K, HCT 30, K+ 4.0, Cr 1.8
   (down).
   MICRO [**10-16**] c diff +
   CXR--no new film from today
   Agree with plan for slow wean of PSV 10/16.  Will likely require trach
   once able to tolerate less PEEP, though with morbid obesity may be
   difficult to achieve PEEP 10.  Continue gentle diuresis with metalazone
   and restart lasix gtt for acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure c/b
   massive volume overload.  Continue attempts to wean gtt sedation and
   transition to fentanyl patch and klonopin.  Regarding temps--continue
   treatment for  c. diff with flagyl IV and vanco PO.  Remains febrile
   but no new cx data revelaing. SC line in X  1 week--site clean,
   difficult access and no bacterial growth from blood.  Plan to d/c after
   picc placement.  Will continue labetalol for HTN and cocaine-induced
   cardiac disease. AF is rate-controlled at present with BB, off

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a past cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the ICU for acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure and respiratory failure. The patient has been febrile with positive Clostridium difficile toxin, indicating a likely source of infection. His respiratory status has improved with increased PEEP and diuresis. The patient's renal function has worsened, but there is evidence of pre-renal azotemia. He is experiencing bleeding from the nose and hematuria, possibly due to systemic anticoagulation. The patient has normocytic anemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and erythema on the lower extremities, which is consistent with chronic stasis dermatitis and venous insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's persistent fever could indicate an ongoing infection, such as Clostridium difficile colitis or another source. It is important to continue treatment with antibiotics and monitor for any worsening symptoms.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to his morbid obesity, acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, and fluid overload. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation, ventilation parameters, and daily weaning of sedation and respiratory support is necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure:"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Patient remains febrile, which is somewhat worrisome, but
   white count is trending down.  AST/Alk phos elevation most likely [**1-14**]
   CHF and increased venous pressure.   Other possible etiologies are less
   likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  Given that cultures have not yet been
   fruitful, will hold cultures for QOD.  Finally, diff shows borderline
   eosinophilia.  If worsens, may increase suspicion of drug fever.
   -Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Given
   improved renal function and yesterday +2L volume status, will resume
   diuresis.   Pt not eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk
   associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient
   to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   -Wean PEEP, tolerating O2 sat of 88-89%
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   -Begin using fentanyl patch at 100 and klonopin 1mg tid for sedation .
   -Goal of 1 to 2 L, with negative balance each hour
   -Avoid increasing Lasix above 10 mg IV per hour.
   -Add metolazone for additional diuresis
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able.
   -PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection, but  has now improved.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue 200 cc free water boluses.
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT
   prophylaxis.  ENT cauterized bleeding sites.
   -Continue packing sinuses with oxymetazoline soaked gauze..
   - consider re-starting ASA after 48 hours without re-bleeding
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient. Requiring D5W
   -D/C drip, increase Lantus dose
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation not
   indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.  Next
   week, consider placing PICC line for access.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequently developed respiratory failure. He was intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23400 cells/microliter, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and elevated lactate levels. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's chest X-ray shows diffuse bilateral infiltrates, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 60-70%, indicating reduced left ventricular systolic function.

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and acute kidney injury (AKI). He also has a history of bleeding, including nosebleeds and hematuria, which may be related to his use of aspirin (ASA) and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's treatment plan includes weaning off sedation, adjusting his diuretic dosage, and managing his blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Patient remains febrile, which is somewhat worrisome, but
   white count is trending down.  AST/Alk phos elevation most likely [**1-14**]
   CHF and increased venous pressure.   Other possible etiologies are less
   likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  Given that cultures have not yet been
   fruitful, will hold cultures for QOD.  Finally, diff shows borderline
   eosinophilia.  If worsens, may increase suspicion of drug fever.
   -Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.  PEEP
   has been increased and decreased based on ABGs but improving with
   diuresis.   Pt not eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk
   associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient
   to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   -Wean PEEP, tolerating O2 sat of 88-89%
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   -Fentanyl patch at 100 and klonopin 1mg tid for sedation .
   -Goal of 1 to 2 L, with negative balance each hour
   -Avoid increasing Lasix above 10 mg IV per hour.
   - Metolazone 5mg PO qday
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able.
   -PM lytes
   - discuss with family tracheostomy
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Creatinine in the 1.8-2.0 range.
   - Follow PM lytes and creatinine
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue 200 cc free water boluses.
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT
   prophylaxis.  ENT cauterized bleeding sites.
   -Continue packing sinuses with oxymetazoline soaked gauze.
   - consider re-starting ASA after 48 hours without re-bleeding
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient. Requiring D5W
   - started Lantus dosing and stopped insuin gtt.  Cover with SS insulin.
   - will re-evaluate Lantus dose with sliding scale needs

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure. He is now in the ICU for further care.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has had a fever since admission, which is worrisome. The white blood cell count is trending down, indicating a possible infection. The positive C. diff toxin suggests that the source of infection could be Clostridium difficile. The cultures have not been fruitful so far, so they will be held for further evaluation. Other possible etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood infection, or drug effect. The patient will continue with IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin. If the fever persists and worsens, there may be an increased suspicion of drug fever.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and morbid obesity. The PEEP has been increased and decreased based on ABGs but improving with diuresis. The goal is to wean the patient to levels suitable for tracheostomy. The patient will be weaned off fentanyl and midazolam, and the fentanyl patch will be at 100 mcg/hour, along with Klonopin"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Patient remains febrile, which is somewhat worrisome, but
   white count is trending down.  AST/Alk phos elevation most likely [**1-14**]
   CHF and increased venous pressure.   Other possible etiologies are less
   likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  Given that cultures have not yet been
   fruitful, will hold cultures for QOD.  Finally, diff shows borderline
   eosinophilia.  If worsens, may increase suspicion of drug fever.
   -Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Given
   improved renal function and yesterday +2L volume status, will resume
   diuresis.   Pt not eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk
   associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient
   to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   -Wean PEEP, tolerating O2 sat of 88-89%
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   -Begin using fentanyl patch at 100 and klonopin 1mg tid for sedation .
   -Goal of 1 to 2 L, with negative balance each hour
   -Avoid increasing Lasix above 10 mg IV per hour.
   -Add metolazone for additional diuresis
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily sedation holidays as able.
   -PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection, but  has now improved.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue 200 cc free water boluses.
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt has been having nose bleeds and hematuria.  Hematuria
   resolved this AM.  Mild decrease in Hct, likely [**1-14**] epistaxis.  No
   systemic anticoagulation; pt is getting SC heparin for DVT
   prophylaxis.  ENT cauterized bleeding sites.
   -Continue packing sinuses with oxymetazoline soaked gauze..
   - consider re-starting ASA after 48 hours without re-bleeding
   #Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   -Tolerating labetalol
   - Hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient. Requiring D5W
   -D/C drip, increase Lantus dose
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation not
   indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, central line.  Oozing decreased.  Next
   week, consider placing PICC line for access.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. He presents with acute shortness of breath, leading to respiratory failure, and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever with positive Clostridium difficile toxin, suggesting a possible source of infection. Other possible etiologies such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood infection, or drug effect should also be considered. Cultures have not been fruitful so far, and the patient is being held for quarterly cultures. The patient is being treated with IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and morbid obesity. The patient has been weaned off high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and is now tolerating an oxygen saturation of 88-89%. The goal is to wean the patient to levels suitable for tracheostomy. Sedation will be gradually reduced, and the patient will be positioned upright in bed to decrease chest wall and abdominal compliance.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened from baseline, with a creatinine"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, heart failure (diastolic), renal failure (acute), pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory failure (acute). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/60 mmHg to 128/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 set at 50%, PEEP at 16 cmH2O, and PS of 14 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment. The blood glucose level is within normal range. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 10.8 K/uL. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and liver function tests are within normal limits or show only slight abnormalities.

The patient has been diuresed successfully with more than 2L of fluid output, but the diuresis was stopped due to an increase in creatinine levels. A PICC line has been ordered but not yet placed"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Patient remains febrile, which is somewhat worrisome, but
   white count is trending down.  AST/Alk phos elevation most likely [**1-14**]
   CHF and increased venous pressure.   Other possible etiologies are less
   likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  Given that cultures have not yet been
   fruitful, will hold cultures for QOD.  Finally, diff shows borderline
   eosinophilia.  If worsens, may increase suspicion of drug fever.
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Placed request for a PICC line that will allow us to remove his CVL.
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Given
   improved renal function and yesterday +2L volume status, will resume
   diuresis.   Pt questionably eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP
   and risk associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean
   patient to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   - Wean PEEP, tolerating O2 sat of 88-89%
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Begin using fentanyl patch at 100 and klonopin 1mg tid for sedation .
   - Goal of 1 to 2 L, with negative balance each hour, cont. to use
   Metolazone with lasix to achieve this goal.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately 1.2.
    Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection, but  has now improved.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes
   and slow the rate of diuresis.
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue 200 cc free water boluses as needed.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient. Requiring D5W
   -D/C drip, increase Lantus dose
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation not
   indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, ordered placement of PICC line with the
   intention of discontinuing his central venous line.  Oozing decreased.
   Next week, consider placing PICC line for access.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. He presents with acute shortness of breath, leading to respiratory failure and subsequent transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient's medical history and current condition indicate several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been febrile since admission, with positive C. difficile toxin, suggesting a potential source of infection. Other possible etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood infection, or drug effect. Cultures have not yet been fruitful, so cultures will be held for QOD. If the fever worsens and is accompanied by worsening white blood cell count, suspicion for drug fever may increase.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and morbid obesity. PEEP has been increased and then weaned down again. The goal is to wean the patient to levels suitable for tracheostomy. The patient should be positioned upright as much as possible to decrease compliance of the chest wall and abdomen.

   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Patient remains febrile, which is somewhat worrisome, but
   white count is trending down.  AST/Alk phos elevation most likely [**1-14**]
   CHF and increased venous pressure.   Other possible etiologies are less
   likely, include VAP, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, blood
   infection, drug effect.  Given that cultures have not yet been
   fruitful, will hold cultures for QOD.  Finally, diff shows borderline
   eosinophilia.  If worsens, may increase suspicion of drug fever.
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   - Tylenol PRN
   - Placed request for a PICC line that will allow us to remove his CVL.
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Given
   improved renal function and yesterday +2L volume status, will resume
   diuresis.   Pt questionably eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP
   and risk associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean
   patient to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   - Wean PEEP, tolerating O2 sat of 88-89%
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Begin using fentanyl patch at 100 and klonopin 1mg tid for sedation .
   - Goal of 1 to 2 L, with negative balance each hour, cont. to use
   Metolazone with lasix to achieve this goal.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection, but  has now improved.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continues trending upwards, order urine lytes
   and slow the rate of diuresis.
   .
   Hypernatremia- Lasix, by acting at ascending loop of Henle, impairs
   kidney
s concentrating ability, causing greater free water loss than
   sodium loss and leading to hypernatremia.  Pt is still volume
   overloaded, but needs free water.
   -Continue 200 cc free water boluses as needed.

   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   - Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Cellulitis much less likely.  Erythema is improving.
   - Consider cellulitis if patient develops asymmetric erythema, fever,
   or white count
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Currently on heparin and labetalol.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation as pt has reports of bleeding.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: On Insulin as outpatient. Requiring D5W
   -D/C drip, increase Lantus dose

   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able

   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation not
   indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, ordered placement of PICC line with the
   intention of discontinuing his central venous line.  Oozing decreased.
   Next week, consider placing PICC line for access.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. He presents with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, requiring transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care. The patient's current condition includes fever, possible Clostridium difficile infection, respiratory failure due to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and morbid obesity. He also has acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, lower extremity erythema, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gout, and morbid obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and positive C. diff toxin suggest an ongoing infection. Cultures have not yet been fruitful, so further evaluation is necessary to identify the source of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to CHF, fluid overload, and morbid obesity. Weaning off the ventilator and managing PEEP levels will be crucial in improving his respiratory status.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened, indicating acute renal failure. Monitoring urine output and electrolyte levels will help guide diuretic therapy and fluid management.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, which led to his transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient has several medical complications including fever, acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, lower extremity erythema, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gout, and morbid obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.2 to 2.1, suggesting acute kidney injury. This could be due to pre-renal causes such as dehydration or hypovolemia. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Normocytic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia with a slight downward trend since admission. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause, which may include iron deficiency or an acute phase reactant.
4. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and now presents with evidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy. His ejection fraction"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male admit with respiratory failure and now with prolonged and
   significant ventilatory support requirements.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -PSV to continue
   -Will need substantial diuresis to allow successful extubation but has
   had slight but significant worsening in renal function
   -The role of chest wall restriction in addition to what may well be
   pulmonary hypertension contributing to persistent problems with
   liberation from mechanical ventilation
   -Continue with high PEEP and PSV wean with ABG re-check
   -Will hope to minimize metabolic demand minimal
   2)Fever-
   -Change CVL today
   -U/S for possible DVT
   -CT head of interest with feeding tube in place
if not possible to get
   CT will trial Afrin and nasal irrigation
   -Continue with ABX and expand with cultures positive
   -PICC considered

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the MICU for further care.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which are likely due to Clostridium difficile infection. The presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters suggests a possible source of infection from a two-week-old central line. Sinusitis is another potential source of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and morbid obesity. PEEP has been increased, but weaning will be done cautiously due to the risk of tracheostomy and accompanying gastrostomy tube placement.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened from 1.2 to 2.3, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to over-diuresis, worsening hemodynamics, or infection. Diuretic therapy will be adjusted accordingly.
4. Normocytic Anemia: The patient has a chronic normocytic anemia with a slight downward trend since admission. Iron study labs are inconclusive, suggesting a mild iron deficiency with elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant. Monitoring of HCT"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with significant obestity and severe compromise in
   ventilatory capacities now with prolonged ICU course and new fevers
   likely explained by catheter related blood stream infection and
   sinsusits as most recent insult.
   1)Respiratory Failiure-
   -PSV support reasonable
   -In the absence of severe compromise will move to trial wean of PSV
   -LIkely only modifiable insult will be volume overload and will attempt
   diuresis but in the setting of febrile illness will be difficult to
   effect
   2)Fever-
   -CVL being chagned today
   -Sinusitis should be treated with sinus drainage
   -Vancomycin IV for GPC's
   -Afrin and Nasal Saline Spray
   3)Volume Overload-
   -Trial of diuresis to negative fluid balance today in the setting of
   stable BP
   -Creatinine improved today with limited diuresis over past 24 hours

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  New positive GPCs raise concern for sepsis, with 2 week-old
   line being likely source.  Sinusitis is other likely source.   AST/Alk
   phos elevation most likely [**1-14**] CHF and increased venous pressure.
   Other possible etiologies are less likely, include VAP, urinary tract
   infection, blood infection, drug effect.
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   -Begin Vancomycin IV for GPC bacteremia
   -D/c old central line
   -Draw blood cx, repeat blood cx tomorrow AM
   -Oxymetazoline x3 days followed by nasal saline sprays
   - Tylenol PRN.
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider abd U/S
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient  had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Will hold
   diuresis to -500cc
s, given bacteremia   Pt questionably eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.
   - Wean pressure support 2-3 mm today, given concern for sepsis and
   diuresis.
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Begin using fentanyl patch at 100 and klonopin 1mg tid for sedation .
   - Goal of -500ccs with Lasix and metolazone.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection.
   - Cr decreased again.  Diurese with goal
 500 cc
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   Hypernatremia- Resolving, latest Na was 141
   -Continue 200 cc free water boluses as needed.
   -hypernatremia
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   -          Check fecal occult blood
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # LE erythema: c/w chronic stasis dermatitis [**1-14**] edema and venous
   insufficiency.  Erythema is improving, does not look like cellulitis
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop last week, but is now
   resolving.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - Begin to consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are
   resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   # DM: ISS.  Increase ISS
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable, continue Lipitor
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation not
   indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, Central line is being d/c
d, new one to
   be placed today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He was admitted due to acute shortness of breath resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a fever with positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin, suggesting a source of infection. New positive gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia raises concern for sepsis, with the two-week-old central line being a likely source. Sinusitis is another possible source. AST/Alk phos elevation most likely indicates congestive heart failure (CHF) and increased venous pressure. Other possible etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection, blood infection, and drug effect.
- Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
- Begin Vancomycin IV for GPC bacteremia
- Draw blood culture, repeat blood culture tomorrow AM
- Oxymetazoline x3 days followed by nasal saline sprays
- Tylenol PRN
- If fevers do not resolve, consider abdominal ultrasound (U/S)

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely due to CHF, fluid overload, and morbid obesity. PEEP was increased, and the patient is now we"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Sinusitis is other likely source, with CT showing
   pan-opacification.   New positive GPCs raise concern for bacteremia,
   but coag-negative staph in only 1 bottle likely contamination.  AST/Alk
   phos elevation most likely [**1-14**] CHF and increased venous pressure.
   Other possible etiologies are less likely, include VAP, urinary tract
   infection, blood infection, drug effect.

   Patient had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Diurese to
   -1L.   Pt questionably eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and
   risk associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean
   patient to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   - Decreased PSV to [**11-27**], wean pressure support and PEEP in 1mm
   increments as tolerated.
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Goal of -1000ccs with Lasix and metolazone.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection.
   - Cr decreased again.  Diurese with goal

   very low, increases suspicion for [**Doctor Last Name 598**].
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.

","The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure. He is now being transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Fever: The patient has a temperature of 101.3°F and a positive Clostridium difficile toxin, indicating a possible source of infection. Sinusitis is another likely source, with a CT scan showing pan-opacification. The new positive gram-positive cocci (GPCs) raise concern for bacteremia, but the coag-negative staphylococcus in only one bottle is likely contamination. The patient is being continued on IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin, and blood cultures are being drawn for further investigation.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and morbid obesity. The patient had positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) increased, and he is now weaning down again. Diuresis has been initiated to manage fluid overload. The patient is questionably eligible for a tracheostomy due to high PEEP and the associated risks with accompanying gastrostomy tube placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He was admitted with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, now being transferred to the MICU for further care. The patient has been febrile with positive C. difficile toxin, suggesting an infection as the source. A new positive gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia raises concern for sepsis, with a 2-week-old line being a likely source. Sinusitis is another possible source. AST/alkaline phosphatase elevation suggests possible congestive heart failure (CHF) and increased venous pressure. Other possible etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection, blood infection, and drug effect.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever: Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin. Begin Vancomycin IV for GPC bacteremia. Draw blood culture, repeat blood culture tomorrow AM. Oxymetazoline x3 days followed by nasal saline sprays. Tylenol PRN. If fevers do not resolve, consider abdominal ultrasound (US).
2. Respiratory failure: Wean pressure support 2-3 mm today, given concern for sepsis and diuresis. Wean fentanyl and midazolam. Begin using fentanyl patch at 100 and klonopin 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with history of obesity and now wadmitted wtih respiratory
   failure and with hosptial course complicated by recurrent fever, acute
   renal failure and persistent respiratory failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure
   -Patient with continued diuresis O/N with -500cc in past 24 hours
   -Versed 5mg/Fentayl 75 IV for sedation
   -He has continued high ventilatory requirements for pressure to support
   him but overall his Ve requirement is relatively limited with [**Name (NI) **] 5-7lpm
   -Will wean PSV to [**11-27**] at this time and recheck ABG but overall minute
   ventilation is unchanged
   -Diruesis is the modifiable variable here and will move to continue
   diruesis
   2)Acute Renal Failure
   -Creatinine improved today to 1.5
   -Patient with capacity to maintain negative fluid balance in that
   setting
   -Hope that this may be resolving ATN at this time in the setting of
   functional hypovolemia with aggressive diuresis attempted and with
   existing pulmonary hypertension.
   3)Fever-
   Catheter related blood stream infection suggested--CVL changed and
   antibiotics in place
   Sinusitis--Local therapies in place
   No evidence of DVT
   Continue with current antibiotics
   4)Proptosis-Has been seen on exam leading up to today but does appear
   to be quite prominent
   -Will review CT scans
   -Will evaluate TSH
   -Will need to review outpatient records as well
   -Further diagnostic evaluations based upon those findings

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity who was admitted with respiratory failure. He has been experiencing recurrent fevers, acute renal failure, and persistent respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, and a tidal volume of 425 mL. The patient's blood gases show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 184. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have high ventilatory requirements, indicating persistent respiratory failure. Sedation with Versed and fentanyl is being used to maintain the patient on mechanical ventilation. Weaning of PSV is planned, but close monitoring of ABG and minute ventilation is necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved to 1.5, suggesting resolution of acute renal failure. Continued aggressive diuresis is being attempted to maintain a negative fluid balance.
3. Fever: The patient has recurrent fevers, and a catheter-related blood stream infection is suspected. The central venous line has been changed, and antibiotics are in"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  Sinusitis is other likely source, with CT showing
   pan-opacification.   New positive GPCs raise concern for bacteremia,
   but coag-negative staph in only 1 bottle likely contamination.  AST/Alk
   phos elevation most likely [**1-14**] CHF and increased venous pressure.
   Other possible etiologies are less likely, include VAP, urinary tract
   infection, blood infection, drug effect.
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   -D/c vancomycin IV
   -begin Augmentin for sinusitis
   -Draw blood cx, repeat blood cx tomorrow AM
   -Oxymetazoline x3 days followed by nasal saline sprays
   - Tylenol PRN.
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider abd U/S
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient had PEEP increased, and is now weaning down again. Diurese to
   -1L.   Pt questionably eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and
   risk associated with accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean
   patient to levels suitable for tracheostomy.
   - Decreased PSV to [**11-27**], wean pressure support and PEEP in 1mm
   increments as tolerated.
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Goal of -1000ccs with Lasix and metolazone.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  No evidence of eos or
   casts.  Bumped creatinine again, causing concern for over-diuresis
   versus worsening hemodynamics [**1-14**] infection.
   - Cr decreased again.  Diurese with goal
 1000 cc
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   -          Check fecal occult blood
   # DM: ISS.  Increase ISS basal lantus
   #Proptosis- [**Month (only) 60**] be [**1-14**] [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections (bacterial
   sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic (lymphoma,
   leukemia)
   -TSH.  Will likely be altered due to sick euthyroid syndrome, but if
   very low, increases suspicion for [**Doctor Last Name 598**].
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop last week, but is now
   resolving.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - Begin to consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are
   resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.  See hypernatremia plan above
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation
   not indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, Central line is being d/c

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He was admitted with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. He is currently being cared for in the MICU.

The patient has several medical complications, including fever with a positive Clostridium difficile toxin, likely sinusitis, new positive gram-positive cocci in bottles raising concern for bacteremia, but possibly contamination, and elevated AST and alkaline phosphatase levels suggesting congestive heart failure and increased venous pressure. Other possible etiologies include ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bloodstream infection, and drug effects.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to congestive heart failure, fluid overload, and morbid obesity. He is being weaned off pressure support and PEEP, and diuresis is being continued with a goal of -1000cc.

The patient also has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.2 on admission that worsened to 2.3. Urine electrolytes and calculated FE urea suggest a pre-renal etiology. The patient's normocytic anemia is chronic, with a slight downward trend since admission. Iron study labs are inconclusive, suggesting mild iron deficiency with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, leading to his transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient's current medical conditions include fever, positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin, likely bacteremia, sinusitis, and respiratory failure. He is also experiencing acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, and proptosis. The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, and morbid obesity.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever and positive C. diff toxin: The patient has likely sources of infection, including sinusitis and bacteremia. The source of bacteremia is suspected to be the arterial line, but endocarditis or other endovascular infections should be considered. Decisions include discontinuing the arterial line, starting vancomycin IV for bacteremia, continuing IV Flagyl, and restarting vancomycin.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient had pulmonary edema, fluid overload, and morbid obesity. PEEP was increased, and the patient is now being weaned down. Diuretics have been initiated to achieve a goal of -1000 cc with Lasix and metolazone. The pressure support ventilation (PSV) has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, leading to his transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient has been diagnosed with several issues:
1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and cultures have shown growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC), suggesting a possible source of infection. There is concern for bacteremia or endocarditis, especially given the presence of GPC in multiple cultures and the patient's history of intravenous drug use.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to obesity, congestive heart failure (CHF), and fluid overload. He is currently being weaned off pressure support ventilation (PSV) and receiving oxygen through an endotracheal tube.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened since admission, with an increase in serum creatinine from 1.2 to 2.3. This suggests a pre-renal etiology, possibly due to dehydration or hypovolemia. Diuretics have been initiated to promote diuresis and improve renal function.

4. Normocytic anemia: The patient has chronic normocytic anemia with a slight downward trend since admission. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause,"

   renal failure now with slow to improve respiratory status.  He has had
   persistent issues of ongoing bloodstream infection but with line
   changed has had ability to continue with gentle diuresis as move to
   wean patient from ventilator
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue diuresis
   -Continue PEEP titration with Goal PO2>70mmHg
   -Move to more aggressive weaning with bloodstream infection resolved
   2)Sepsis-
   -Continue with ABX
restart Vanco with GPC
s in blood
   -Will D/C arterial catheter
   -WIll continue to treat sinusitis as possible contributor to ongoing
   fevers
   -Will need to consider ECHO for persistent positive cultures on
   antibiotics
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue with gentle diruesis with creatinine improving and need to
   mobilize fluid as possible.
   -Given ongoing insult will continue full support

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with obesity who was admitted with respiratory failure and acute renal failure. He has had persistent issues with an ongoing bloodstream infection but has had the ability to continue with gentle diuresis as he moves to wean off the ventilator.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's respiratory status is slow to improve, indicating a risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis - The patient has ongoing bloodstream infection despite line changes, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Acute Renal Failure - The patient's acute renal failure needs continued support and close monitoring.
4. Hypokalemia (Low Potassium) - The patient has low potassium levels, which may require correction.
5. Hypernatremia (High Sodium) - The patient has high sodium levels, which may require management.
6. Anxiety - The patient is experiencing anxiety, which may require additional support or treatment.
7. Epiptaxis (Nosebleed) - The patient had a nosebleed, which may require further evaluation or intervention.
8. Alteration in Elimination related to diarrhea - The patient has diarrhea, which may affect his fluid and electrolyte balance.
9. Fever, unknown origin - The patient has persistent fevers, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
10. Obesity - The patient's obesity may complicate his recovery and increase the risk of other medical conditions.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: White count continues to trend down.  Patient was afebrile
   yesterday.  C diff infection- treating with PO vanco IV Flagyl.
   Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia- treating with vancomycin IV,
   pulled arterial line, and placed new a-line.  For his sinusitis per CT,
   we are treating with augmentin PO oxymetazoline course, and
   pseudoephedrine.
   -Continue surveillance blood cultures
   -F/u results for TTE for endocarditis
   -Continue vancomycin IV  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin for C. diff
   -Continue Augmentin for sinusitis
   -d/c oxymetazoline, begin nasal sprays.
   - Tylenol PRN.
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider abd U/S
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient lost volume with weaning trial yesterday.   Pt questionably
   eligible for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with
   accompanying G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels
   suitable for tracheostomy.
   - Check ABG, Increase PEEP to 16-18 today.
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Goal of -1000ccs with Lasix and metolazone.  Maximum of 10 mg
   lasix/hour.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  Creatinine has been
   near baseline at 1.4
   - Cr decreased again.  Diurese with goal
 1000 cc
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend since
   admission.   Iron study labs not conclusive, with low reticulocyte
   count suggesting mild production problem.  [**Name (NI) 60**] be mild iron deficiency
   with superimposed elevated ferritin as an acute phase reactant.
   Patient is not hemolyzing per labs.   First Guiaic negative.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.  If pt begins bleeding
   profusely, ENT consult.
   -          Check fecal occult blood
   # DM: ISS.  Increased ISS
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop last week, but is now
   resolving.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - Begin to consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are
   resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation
   not indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced, New central line placed on [**8-24**].

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient is being treated for various medical conditions including fever (possible C. diff infection), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, and sinusitis.

The patient's respiratory status remains critical with ongoing respiratory failure. Efforts are being made to wean him off mechanical ventilation, but there are concerns about his high PEEP levels and the risk associated with tracheostomy. There is also a mention of possible bronchospastic component for which Ipratropium/Albuterol is being administered.

The patient's renal function has shown improvement with decreasing creatinine levels. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid overload, with the goal of removing 1000 cc of fluid.

There is a mention of normocytic anemia, which is a chronic issue for the patient. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia.

The patient's proptosis has been documented and further evaluation is required to rule out potential causes such as infection, infiltration, or neoplastic conditions.

The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and prior myocardial infarction. He is currently"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

24-hour events include the placement of an arterial line, positive gram-positive cocci in [number] bottles from aline, initiation of Vanco IV, pulling of the arterial line and placing a new one, restarting metolazone, and attempted weaning of PSV to 13 PEEP but desaturation occurred.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.4°C, heart rate 74 bpm, blood pressure 116/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a heart rhythm of AF.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,677 mL and total output of 2,824 mL, resulting in a balance of 853 mL. The patient has received 3,677 mL of fluids, including 841 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 1,606 mL of intravenous fluids, and 841 mL of blood products. The patient has lost 2,824 mL of fluids through urine output of 2,814 mL, NG drainage of 10 mL, and stool output of 853 mL.

Respiratory support includes delivery of oxygen through an endotracheal tube and ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode at a tidal volume of 475 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 62 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 152.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 347 K/uL, hyponatremia with sodium (Na+) levels of 140 mg/dL, hyperkalemia with potassium (K+) levels of 5.0 mEq/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, and elevated troponin-T levels.

The patient's medical complications include electrolyte and fluid disorder, anxiety, hypernatremia, epistaxis, alteration in nutrition, fever of unknown origin, obesity, respiratory failure, heart failure, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes electrolyte and fluid disorder, alteration in nutrition, anxiety, hypernatremia, epistaxis, fever of unknown origin, obesity, respiratory failure, heart failure, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: White count continues to trend down.  Patient was afebrile
   yesterday.  C diff infection- treating with PO vanco IV Flagyl.
   Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia- treating with vancomycin IV,
   pulled arterial line, and placed new a-line.  For his sinusitis per CT,
   we are treating with augmentin PO, oxymetazoline course, and
   pseudoephedrine.
   -Continue surveillance blood cultures
   -F/u results for TTE for endocarditis
   -Continue vancomycin IV  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin for C. diff
   -Continue Augmentin for sinusitis
   -d/c oxymetazoline, begin nasal saline sprays.
   -d/c pseudoephedrine
   - Tylenol PRN.
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider abd U/S
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient lost volume with weaning trial yesterday.   Pt not yet eligible
   for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying
   G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.
   - Check ABG, Increase PEEP to 16-18 today to re-recruit deflated
   alveoli.  Check second ABG, then possibly lower PEEP by 1.
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Goal of -1000ccs with Lasix and metolazone.  Maximum of 10 mg
   lasix/hour.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  Creatinine has been
   near baseline at 1.4
   - Cr decreased again.  Diurese with goal
 1000 cc
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend.  Per
   labs, unclear, probably iron deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had
   bleeding episode, cauterized by ENT.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   -
   # DM: ISS.  Increased ISS
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop last week, but is now
   resolving.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation
   not indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been diagnosed with fever, coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia, sinusitis, and possible endocarditis. He also has normocytic anemia, chronic renal failure, and morbid obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff infection: The patient is being treated with vancomycin IV and Flagyl for a C. diff infection. It is important to continue the treatment as prescribed to prevent worsening of the infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The goal is to wean him off the ventilator and eventually perform a tracheostomy. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci. Treatment with vancomycin IV should continue until the infection is cleared.
4. Endocarditis: Given the presence of bacteremia and the possibility of endocarditis, further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, which led to his transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient is morbidly obese, with a height of 70 inches and an unknown weight. He has been receiving mechanical ventilation support and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 475 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His blood pressure is within normal limits, and his heart rate is slightly elevated.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of glucose, creatinine, and liver enzymes, along with a low white blood cell count. He has a positive glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, indicating poor glycemic control. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with elevated potassium and magnesium levels. Imaging studies reveal proptosis of the eyes, which may be due to an underlying condition such as infection or infiltrative disease.

The patient's medical history includes acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, gout, and morbid obesity"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: With positive C.  diff toxin, patient has likely source for
   infection.  New positive GPC culture in [**1-14**] bottles raise concern for
   bacteremia.  Source likely to be arterial line, as central line
   cultures drawn simultaneously were negative.  However, in hospitalized
   patients with several cultures showing GPC, should consider possibility
   of endocarditis or other endovascular infection.  Sinusitis is other
   likely source, with CT showing pan-opacification.
   -D/c arterial line, insert new arterial line
   -Continue surveillance blood cultures
   -TTE for endocarditis
   -Re-start vancomycin IV  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin
   -Continue Augmentin for sinusitis
   -Oxymetazoline x2 more days followed by nasal saline sprays

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: White count continues to trend down.  Patient was afebrile
   yesterday.  C diff infection- treating with PO vanco IV Flagyl.
   Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia- treating with vancomycin IV,
   pulled arterial line, and placed new a-line.  For his sinusitis per CT,
   we are treating with augmentin PO, oxymetazoline course, and
   pseudoephedrine.
   -Continue surveillance blood cultures
   -F/u results for TTE for endocarditis
   -Continue vancomycin IV  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin for C. diff
   -Continue Augmentin for sinusitis
   -d/c oxymetazoline, begin nasal saline sprays.
   -d/c pseudoephedrine
   - Tylenol PRN.
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider abd U/S
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient lost volume with weaning trial yesterday.   Pt not yet eligible
   for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying
   G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.
   - Check ABG, Increase PEEP to 16-18 today to re-recruit deflated
   alveoli.  Check second ABG, then possibly lower PEEP by 1.
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Goal of -1000ccs with Lasix and metolazone.  Maximum of 10 mg
   lasix/hour.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  Creatinine has been
   near baseline at 1.4
   - Cr decreased again.  Diurese with goal
 1000 cc
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend.  Per
   labs, unclear, probably iron deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had
   bleeding episode, cauterized by ENT.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   -
   # DM: ISS.  Increased ISS
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop last week, but is now
   resolving.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation
   not indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with history of obesity and now with persistent ventilatory
   failure but perhaps more significantly hypoxemia in the setting of
   volume overload, obesity and signficiant chest wall restriction has
   maintained elevated PEEP requirement and only with slow diuresis have
   we been able to decrease PEEP to 14 over time.  In this setting he has
   re-emerged with GPC's--coag negative staph in blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   cultures.
   Respiratory Failure-
   -Patient with PEEP titration completed yesterday and will need
   continued diuresis
   -Lasix gtt to continue
   -PEEP titration limited by abdominal compartment, volume overload and
   will move to diuresis today.
   -Trial increased PEEP to 18 and repeat ABG this afternoon
   -Continue with PSV=10
   -Will need tracheostomy and will work to have safe PEEP for procedure
   and placement
   Volume Overload-
   Creatinine improved
   Continue with Lasix gtt to continue

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity and persistent ventilatory failure. He is currently experiencing hypoxemia and has signs of volume overload, chest wall restriction, and elevated PEEP requirements. The patient has been diagnosed with coag-negative staphylococci in blood cultures, which may indicate a bacterial infection. He is receiving treatment with vancomycin for the infection. The patient's respiratory failure is limiting PEEP titration due to abdominal compartment syndrome and volume overload. Diuresis has been initiated to manage these issues. The patient also has a fever, which is being treated with augmentin and c.difficile precautions. Other medical conditions include electrolyte and fluid disorders, anxiety, hypernatremia, alteration in nutrition, epistaxis, alteration in elimination, fever of unknown origin, obesity, nosebleed, acidosis, acute respiratory failure, chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is the primary concern, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the limitations in PEEP titration due to abdominal compartment syndrome and volume overload.
2. Bacterial infection: The presence of coag-negative staphylococci in blood cultures suggests a bacterial infection, which may lead to sepsis if not appropriately"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: White count continues to trend down.  Patient was afebrile
   yesterday, now with low grade fever.  C diff infection: treating with
   PO vanco and IV Flagyl.  Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia: treating
   with vancomycin IV.  For his sinusitis per CT, we are treating with
   augmentin PO.  CT abdomen showed diverticulosis but no diverticulitis,
   gall bladder and pancreas were unremarkable.
   - Continue surveillance blood cultures, also urine and sputum if he
   spikes a fever or WBC climbs
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 6)  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 11), PO vancomycin (Day 11) for C. diff
   - Continue Augmentin (Day 4) for sinusitis
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient lost volume with weaning trial yesterday.   Pt not yet eligible
   for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying
   G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.  Increased PEEP to 16 yesterday to re-recruit deflated
   alveoli.  Cr increases 1.5 -> 2+ when too aggressively diuresed.
   -  Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Difficulty diuresing b/c of increasing creatinine. Will diurese as
   tolerated.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  Creatinine had been
   near baseline at 1.4, now increasing.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend.  Per
   labs, unclear, probably iron deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had
   bleeding episode, cauterized by ENT.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   # DM: ISS. Blood glucose stable.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop last week, but is now
   resolving.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation
   not indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. The patient presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequently developed respiratory failure. He is currently being treated in the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever. He is being treated for C. diff infection with oral vancomycin and intravenous Flagyl, as well as coagulase-negative Staph bacteremia with intravenous vancomycin. Surveillance blood cultures, urine, and sputum will be monitored if the patient spikes a fever or white blood cell count (WBC) climbs.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and morbid obesity. The goal is to wean the patient to levels suitable for tracheostomy. The patient's peak expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased to 16 cmH2O to re-recruit deflated alveoli. Creatinine increases when the patient is aggressively diuresed, so diuresis will be done as tolerated. Positioning the patient upright in bed may help decrease chest wall and abdominal compliance. Fentanyl and midazolam infusions will be weaned as tolerated. Difficulty in"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: White count continues to trend down.  Patient was afebrile
   yesterday, now with low grade fever.  C diff infection: treating with
   PO vanco and IV Flagyl.  Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia: treating
   with vancomycin IV.  For his sinusitis per CT, we are treating with
   augmentin PO, oxymetazoline course, and pseudoephedrine.
   -Continue surveillance blood cultures
   -F/u results for TTE for endocarditis
   -Continue vancomycin IV  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin for C. diff
   -Continue Augmentin for sinusitis
   -d/c oxymetazoline, begin nasal saline sprays.
   -d/c pseudoephedrine
   - Tylenol PRN.
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider abd U/S
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient lost volume with weaning trial yesterday.   Pt not yet eligible
   for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying
   G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.
   - Check ABG, Increase PEEP to 16-18 today to re-recruit deflated
   alveoli.  Check second ABG, then possibly lower PEEP by 1.
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Goal of -1000ccs with Lasix and metolazone.  Maximum of 10 mg
   lasix/hour.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  Creatinine has been
   near baseline at 1.4
   - Cr decreased again.  Diurese with goal
 1000 cc
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend.  Per
   labs, unclear, probably iron deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had
   bleeding episode, cauterized by ENT.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   # DM: ISS.  Increased ISS
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop last week, but is now
   resolving.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation
   not indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a past cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further care.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including fever, suspected C. difficile infection, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, sinusitis, morbid obesity, fluid overload, congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, diabetes mellitus, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, and morbid obesity.

The assessment and plan section highlights the following:

1. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, and treatments for C. difficile infection and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia are being continued.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to CHF, fluid overload, and morbid obesity. Goals include weaning the patient off respiratory support, increasing PEEP to 16-18 to recruit alveoli, and then possibly lowering it by 1. The patient is also being given ipratropium/albuterol for a possible bronchospastic component and positioned upright to decrease chest wall and abdominal compliance.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a previous cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and is being transferred to the MICU for further care. The patient has multiple medical complications including fever, bacteremia (coagulase-negative Staph), sinusitis, C. difficile infection, congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, morbid obesity, acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, diabetes mellitus, proptosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, and morbid obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to his morbid obesity and potential bronchospastic component.
2. Infection: The patient has fever and multiple infections such as bacteremia (coagulase-negative Staph), sinusitis, and C. difficile infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
3. CHF/Fluid Overload: The patient's respiratory failure may be contributing to volume overload and CHF. Diuretic therapy and fluid restriction should be considered.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and there is evidence of pre-renal etiology. Diuretic therapy"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: White count continues to trend down.  Patient was afebrile
   yesterday, now with low grade fever.  C diff infection: treating with
   PO vanco and IV Flagyl.  Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia: treating
   with vancomycin IV.  For his sinusitis per CT, we are treating with
   augmentin PO.
   - Continue surveillance blood cultures
   - F/u results for TTE for endocarditis
   - Continue vancomycin IV  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO vancomycin for C. diff
   - Continue Augmentin for sinusitis
   - d/c oxymetazoline, begin nasal saline sprays.
   - d/c pseudoephedrine
   - Tylenol PRN.
   -  If fevers do not resolve, consider abd U/S
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient lost volume with weaning trial yesterday.   Pt not yet eligible
   for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying
   G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.
   - Check ABG, Increase PEEP to 16-18 today to re-recruit deflated
   alveoli.  Check second ABG, then possibly lower PEEP by 1.
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam
   - Goal of -1000ccs with Lasix and metolazone.  Maximum of 10 mg
   lasix/hour.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  Creatinine has been
   near baseline at 1.4
   - Cr decreased again.  Diurese with goal
 1000 cc
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend.  Per
   labs, unclear, probably iron deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had
   bleeding episode, cauterized by ENT.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   # DM: ISS.  Increased ISS
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic and normotensive.
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop last week, but is now
   resolving.  CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   -labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.  Systemic anticoagulation
   not indicated given bleeding.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, and was admitted to the medical ICU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Surveillance blood cultures have been ordered to identify the causative organism.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to several factors including CHF, fluid overload, and morbid obesity. The goal is to wean the patient off mechanical ventilation and eventually consider tracheostomy. Increasing PEEP to 16-18 and checking ABG may help in recruiting alveoli.

3. Coagulase Negative Staph Bacteremia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin IV for a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia. It is important to continue surveillance blood cultures and follow up with the results.

4. Clostridium difficile Infection (C. diff): The patient is being treated with PO vancomycin and IV Flagyl for a suspected C. diff infection. Monitoring for resolution of symptoms and continuing antibiotic therapy is essential.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened from a baseline of approximately 1.2 to 2"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, respiratory failure, heart failure, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing ventilatory failure with hypoxemia. The patient has been on diuretics and has had his PEEP requirement reduced to 14. He has developed fevers and bacteremia, with negative blood cultures since October 24th. The patient is also experiencing volume overload, which has led to an increase in creatinine levels. He has been receiving antibiotics and other medications to manage his conditions. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilatory Failure: The patient's persistent ventilatory failure and hypoxemia may lead to further respiratory distress and difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of heart failure and the current signs of volume overload increase the risk of worsening cardiac function, leading to fluid accumulation and pulmonary edema.
3. Renal Failure: The worsening creatinine levels indicate a decline in renal function, which can result in the accumulation of toxic substances in the body and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The presence of fevers and bacteremia suggests an ongoing infection, which could be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or another source. This infection poses a significant risk to the patient's stability and overall prognosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of obesity and chronic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation due to ventilatory failure. The patient has been experiencing fevers, and cultures have shown growth of coag-negative staphylococci in the blood.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has several medical complications, including hypokalemia (low potassium), anxiety, fever of unknown origin, obesity, nosebleed, heart failure (diastolic, acute on chronic), renal failure (acute), pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type II), atrial fibrillation, and chronic respiratory failure.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to obesity and volume overload. The physician plans to continue diuresis and adjust the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) accordingly. A tracheostomy is also planned, and efforts will be made to maintain a safe PEEP level during the procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The physician suspects this possibility and is considering it as a differential diagnosis for the patient's fevers.

2. Central venous line infection: The patient's central venous line is another potential source of infection. The physician is considering this possibility as well.

3. Clostridium difficile infection: Due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including obesity, atrial fibrillation, chronic respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure on chronic, renal failure (acute), pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and anxiety. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F (Tmax), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/66 mmHg to 122/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a CVP of 18 mmHg.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, and blood cultures have been negative since October 24th. Antibiotics have been administered, including vancomycin, augmentin, and flagyl. The patient's creatinine levels have worsened, indicating possible volume overload.

The patient's laboratory results show hypokalemia (low potassium), hypotassium (low magnesium), elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no infiltrates or effusion, but there is evidence of pulmonary hypertension.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current assessments include hypokalemia, anxiety, fever of"

   Sputum Gram stain: 4+ gram positive cocci in pairs, chains.
   CXR: b/l pleural effusions, worse than [**10-24**].
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   # Fever: Patient was febrile yesterday, afebrile so far today.  Started
   Zosyn for G+ cocci in sputum and fevers through current antibiotic
   coverage with PO vanco and IV Flagyl for CDiff and IV vanc for
   Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia.  For his sinusitis per CT, we had
   been treating with augmentin PO but will d/c this b/c of adequate
   coverage with unasyn.  To note, prior CT abdomen 11/5showed
   diverticulosis but no diverticulitis, gall bladder and pancreas were
   unremarkable.
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 6)  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 12), PO vancomycin (Day 12) for C. diff
   - d/c Augmentin (at Day 5) for sinusitis
 re-start if unasyn is d/c
   before 10 day course is not complete.
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient lost volume with weaning trial yesterday.   Pt not yet eligible
   for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying
   G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.  Increased PEEP to 16 yesterday to re-recruit deflated
   alveoli.  Cr increases 1.5 -> 2+ when too aggressively diuresed.
   -  Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Difficulty diuresing b/c of increasing creatinine. Will diurese as
   tolerated.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  Creatinine had been
   near baseline at 1.4, now increasing.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend.  Per
   labs, unclear, probably iron deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with acute shortness of breath, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has been febrile, with persistent fever and chronic sinusitis. He has been treated with various antibiotics for suspected bacterial infections, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving sedation and analgesia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to obesity, congestive heart failure (CHF), and fluid overload. The high PEEP required may contribute to barotrauma and lung injury. Weaning from mechanical ventilation could be challenging due to these factors.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have progressively increased, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to pre-renal causes, such as dehydration or hypovolemia, or intrinsic renal damage. Diuresis should be carefully managed to avoid further deterioration.
3. Normocytic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may be due to iron deficiency or chronic disease. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and evaluating for bleeding episodes is important.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes is well-controlled, but ongoing monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure, now being transferred to the
   MICU for further care.
   # Fever: White count continues to trend down.  Patient was afebrile
   yesterday, now with low grade fever.  C diff infection: treating with
   PO vanco and IV Flagyl.  Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia: treating
   with vancomycin IV.  For his sinusitis per CT, we are treating with
   augmentin PO.  CT abdomen showed diverticulosis but no diverticulitis,
   gall bladder and pancreas were unremarkable.
   - Continue surveillance blood cultures, also urine and sputum if he
   spikes a fever or WBC climbs
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 6)  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 11), PO vancomycin (Day 11) for C. diff
   - Continue Augmentin (Day 4) for sinusitis
   - Tylenol PRN
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient lost volume with weaning trial yesterday.   Pt not yet eligible
   for tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying
   G tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.  Increased PEEP to 16 yesterday to re-recruit deflated
   alveoli.  Cr increases 1.5 -> 2+ when too aggressively diuresed.
   -  Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Difficulty diuresing b/c of increasing creatinine. Will diurese as
   tolerated.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Urine lytes and
   calculated FE urea suggest pre-renal etiology.  Creatinine had been
   near baseline at 1.4, now increasing.
   - Follow PM lytes.  If continue trending upwards, order urine lytes.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue, with slight downward trend.  Per
   labs, unclear, probably iron deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had
   bleeding episode, cauterized by ENT.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   # DM: ISS. Blood glucose stable.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and positive gram stain with 4+ G+ diplococci suggest a possible bacterial infection. Cultures have been sent to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support and has a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 178, indicating some degree of respiratory compromise.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. The echocardiogram shows tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery stenosis.

4. Renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels from 1.4 to 2.1 indicate acute renal failure. Lasix was held due to this.

5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypo potassium (low potassium) and hypernatremia (high sodium) levels.

6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,369 mL and output of 1,740 mL over 24 hours.

7. Impaired skin integrity: There is a mention of impaired skin integrity in the assessment and plan.

8. Obesity: The patient has a history of obesity.

9. Diabetes: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus.

10. Pulmonary hypertension: The echocardiogram shows mild pulmonary artery stenosis, which could be associated with pulmonary hypertension.

11. Nosocomial infections: Given the prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

It is important to note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note and may not be an exhaustive list."

   Sputum Gram stain: 4+ gram positive cocci in pairs, chains.
   CXR: b/l pleural effusions, worse than [**10-24**].
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   # Fever: Patient was febrile yesterday, afebrile so far today.  Started
   Zosyn for G+ cocci in sputum and fevers through current antibiotic
   coverage with PO vanco and IV Flagyl for CDiff and IV vanc for
   Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia.  For his sinusitis per CT, we had
   been treating with augmentin PO but will d/c this b/c of adequate
   coverage with unasyn.  To note, prior CT abdomen 11/5showed
   diverticulosis but no diverticulitis, gall bladder and pancreas were
   unremarkable.
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 6)  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 12), PO vancomycin (Day 12) for C. diff
   - d/c Augmentin (at Day 5) for sinusitis
 re-start if unasyn is d/c
   before 10 day course is not complete.
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Renal failure
   improved when diuresis was held.  Has had similar episode over past 3
   days.   Urine lytes and calculated FE urea again suggest pre-renal
   etiology.  Creatinine had been near baseline at 1.4, now 2.1
   -          Follow PM lytes.
   -          Hold diuretics
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops sat when PEEP weaned.
   Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but no AS, AR, decreased
   LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent, persistent pleural
   effusions/pulmonary edema. Believe that pt is not yet eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.
   - Discuss with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6516**] possibility of trach even with high PEEP
   requirement: what would be the upper limit of pressure support safe on
   trach?
   -  Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Difficulty diuresing b/c of increasing creatinine. Will diurese as
   tolerated.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   # DM: ISS. Blood glucose stable.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. The note indicates that the patient has respiratory failure, persistent fevers, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity. The patient also has a history of obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and anxiety.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.9, heart rate between 76-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/66 mmHg to 127/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 398 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 13 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and a plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), high serum creatinine, low potassium levels, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values including glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

The patient has been started on various medications including antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, metronidazole), sedatives (midazolam, fentanyl), and anticoagulant (heparin). The patient's fluid balance and nutritional support are also being managed in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of renal function. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, electrolytes, and organ function is necessary to prevent these complications and ensure proper management of the patient's critical condition."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity and persistent ventilatory failure. He is currently experiencing fevers and has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by gram-positive diplococci. The patient also has several other medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The presence of fevers and new-onset GPC's in blood cultures from 10/24 suggests a possible infection. Appropriate antibiotics have been started, but further follow-up cultures are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, possibly due to fluid overload. Continued diuresis may be necessary to manage this issue.

3. Tracheostomy: The patient will require a tracheostomy, but safe PEEP levels need to be determined for the procedure and placement. This can be challenging in patients with obesity and chest wall restriction.

4. Coagulation disorder: The patient has coagulation abnormalities (PT/PTT/INR), which may increase the risk of bleeding during procedures.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate hypernatremia, which can be associated with dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.

6. Hypokalemia:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity and several medical complications. The patient is currently experiencing persistent ventilatory failure, hypoxemia, volume overload, and chest wall restriction. The note mentions that the patient has been on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP requirement due to these factors.

The patient's blood cultures from October 24th were negative for coag-negative staphylococci, but they were sensitive to vancomycin. The patient has been started on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole for antibiotic coverage. Sputum cultures are also being followed up, which are concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels. The note suggests that the diuretic therapy may have reached its maximum effect and needs further evaluation.

Other assessments and plans mentioned in the note include electrolyte and fluid disorder, alteration in nutrition, anxiety, hypernatremia, epistaxis, alteration in elimination related to diarrhea, fever of unknown origin, obesity, respiratory failure (acute and chronic), heart failure (diastolic acute on chronic), renal failure (acute), pulmonary hypertension, impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his various medical issues."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity and several medical conditions. The patient is currently experiencing ventilatory failure and hypoxemia, along with volume overload. The patient has also shown signs of fever and positive blood cultures for coag-negative staph, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and presence of fever, there is a risk of developing VAP.

2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's history of diabetes and the presence of high blood glucose levels suggest that DKA could be a potential complication.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia could progress to ARDS if not properly managed.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU.

5. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The presence of multiple central lines increases the risk of CRBSI.

6. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate possible acute kidney injury, which may progress to CKD if not addressed.

7. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and positive sputum culture for gram-positive diplococci suggest"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are experiencing respiratory failure, persistent fevers, and have a history of obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. The patient is also dealing with renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs. This can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or exacerbation of underlying chronic respiratory conditions.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers, indicating an ongoing inflammatory or infectious process. Identifying the source of infection is crucial to initiate appropriate treatment and prevent further complications.

3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has electrolyte imbalances including hypokalemia (low potassium) and hypernatremia (high sodium). These imbalances can affect multiple organ systems and require careful correction to avoid complications like cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is exhibiting signs of acute renal failure, which can be caused by factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or direct kidney injury. Renal failure can result in fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances, and decreased urine output.

5. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which is characterized by increased pressure in"

   # Fever: Patient had low-grade fevers.  Started Zosyn for G+ cocci in
   sputum and fevers in spite of current antibiotic coverage with PO vanco
   and IV Flagyl for CDiff and IV vanc for Coagulase negative Staph
   bacteremia.  For his sinusitis per CT, we had been treating with
   augmentin PO but will d/c this b/c of adequate coverage with unasyn.
   To note, prior CT abdomen [**10-18**] showed diverticulosis but no
   diverticulitis, gall bladder and pancreas were unremarkable.  Patient
   has new lines, decreasing risk of line infections.
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 7)  for bacteremia, switch dose to 1g q
   24hours, checking vanco trough tonight at 6 PM before next dose.
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 13), PO vancomycin (Day 13) for C. diff
   - d/c Augmentin (at Day 5) for sinusitis
 re-start if unasyn is d/c
   before 10 day course is not complete.
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops sat when PEEP weaned.
   Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but no AS, AR, decreased
   LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent, persistent pleural
   effusions/pulmonary edema. Believe that pt is not yet eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement.   Will sit patient upright in order to increase
   compliance and decrease PEEP, as patient may have negative end pleural
   pressures.
   - Discuss with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4834**] possibility of trach even with high PEEP
   requirement: what would be the upper limit of pressure support safe on
   trach?
   - Transition from  bed to chair
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Difficulty diuresing b/c of increasing creatinine. Will diurese 1L as
   tolerated.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Renal failure
   improved when diuresis was held.  Has had similar episode over past 3
   days.   Urine lytes and calculated FE urea again suggest pre-renal
   etiology.  Creatinine had gone up to 2.1, now back down to 1.8
   -          Follow PM lytes.
   -      D/c Lasix drip.  Bolus Lasix 80 mg IV x 1 this AM, recheck in PM
   for creatinine rise
   # DM: ISS. Elevated blood sugars.
   -Increase fixed Lantus dose.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation given potential trach in next few days.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with acute shortness of breath leading to respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU for chronic fever, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications for his conditions. His vital signs are stable, but he continues to have fever, elevated blood sugars, normocytic anemia, and proptosis. The patient's medical history and current conditions pose several potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient has already been started on empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected VAP.
2. Line infections: The patient has multiple lines, including a central line and arterial line, which can increase the risk of line infections. Cultures from these lines should be monitored.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated blood sugars and history of diabetes mellitus put him at risk for DKA. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has fluctuated, indicating a possible AKI. It is important to monitor kidney function closely and adjust diuretic therapy"

The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, for which he was intubated. The patient has been febrile and has had persistent fever, leading to the initiation of antibiotic coverage. He also has chronic sinusitis, diverticulosis, and a history of gout. The patient is morbidly obese and has chronic anemia. He has acute renal failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. The patient's medical team is concerned about potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and nosocomial infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcers: Prolonged critical illness and medications can predispose the patient to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures can increase the risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   # Fever: Patient was febrile yesterday, afebrile so far today.  Started
   Zosyn for G+ cocci in sputum and fevers through current antibiotic
   coverage with PO vanco and IV Flagyl for CDiff and IV vanc for
   Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia.  For his sinusitis per CT, we had
   been treating with augmentin PO but will d/c this b/c of adequate
   coverage with unasyn.  To note, prior CT abdomen 11/5showed
   diverticulosis but no diverticulitis, gall bladder and pancreas were
   unremarkable.
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 6)  for bacteremia
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 12), PO vancomycin (Day 12) for C. diff
   - d/c Augmentin (at Day 5) for sinusitis
 re-start if unasyn is d/c
   before 10 day course is not complete.
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Renal failure
   improved when diuresis was held.  Has had similar episode over past 3
   days.   Urine lytes and calculated FE urea again suggest pre-renal
   etiology.  Creatinine had been near baseline at 1.4, now 2.1
   -          Follow PM lytes.
   -          Hold diuretics
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops sat when PEEP weaned.
   Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but no AS, AR, decreased
   LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent, persistent pleural
   effusions/pulmonary edema. Believe that pt is not yet eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement.   Goal to wean patient to levels suitable for
   tracheostomy.
   - Discuss with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6516**] possibility of trach even with high PEEP
   requirement: what would be the upper limit of pressure support safe on
   trach?
   -  Position as upright as possible in bed for decreased compliance [**1-14**]
   chest wall and abdomen
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Difficulty diuresing b/c of increasing creatinine. Will diurese as
   tolerated.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   # DM: ISS. Blood glucose stable.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a previous cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequently developed respiratory failure. He has been febrile intermittently, and cultures have shown growth of gram-positive cocci in the sputum. He has been treated with various antibiotics including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient also has acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, and morbid obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure despite being on mechanical ventilation. There is concern about the possibility of tracheostomy due to high PEEP requirements.
2. Fever and Bacteremia: The patient has had intermittent fevers, and blood cultures have shown growth of gram-positive cocci, indicating a possible bloodstream infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, and there are signs of pre-renal etiology. Diuretics should be held, and further evaluation of renal function is needed.
4. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and now presents with ischemic cardiomyopathy. There is diastolic dysfunction"

   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   # Fever: Patient had low-grade fevers.  Started Zosyn for G+ cocci in
   sputum and fevers in spite of current antibiotic coverage with PO vanco
   and IV Flagyl for CDiff and IV vanc for Coagulase negative Staph
   bacteremia.  For his sinusitis per CT, we had been treating with

   diverticulitis, gall bladder and pancreas were unremarkable.  Patient
   has new lines, decreasing risk of line infections.
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 7)  for bacteremia, switch dose to 1g q
   24hours, checking vanco trough tonight at 6 PM before next dose.

 re-start if unasyn is d/c
   before 10 day course is not complete.
   - Tylenol PRN

   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops sat when PEEP weaned.
   Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but no AS, AR, decreased
   LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent, persistent pleural
   effusions/pulmonary edema. Believe that pt is not yet eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement.   Will sit patient upright in order to increase
   compliance and decrease PEEP, as patient may have negative end pleural
   pressures.
   - Discuss with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4834**] possibility of trach even with high PEEP
   requirement: what would be the upper limit of pressure support safe on
   trach?
   - Transition from  bed to chair
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Difficulty diuresing b/c of increasing creatinine. Will diurese 1L as
   tolerated.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Renal failure
   improved when diuresis was held.  Has had similar episode over past 3
   days.   Urine lytes and calculated FE urea again suggest pre-renal
   etiology.  Creatinine had been near baseline at 1.4, now 2.1
   -          Follow PM lytes.
   -          Hold diuretics
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   # DM: ISS. Blood glucose stable.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - consider re-starting anti-coagulation as nosebleeds are resolved
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control

   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese man with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure. He has been experiencing persistent respiratory failure and chronic fever. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for suspected infections, including G+ cocci in sputum and fevers. He also has a history of diverticulosis, but no diverticulitis, and his gall bladder and pancreas are unremarkable.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 117/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 305 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 13 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 140, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.6 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.8 mg/dL, blood glucose (Glucose) of 160 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 28.0 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium (K+) of 3.4 mEq/L and magnesium (Mg++) of 2.1 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild crackles bilaterally, decreased distention of the abdomen, and 2+ edema in the extremities. Neurologic examination shows sedation and response to painful stimuli.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever: The patient has had persistent low-grade fevers, and he has been started on Zosyn for G+ cocci in sputum and fevers. Current antibiotic coverage with PO vancomycin and IV Flagyl for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and IV vancomycin for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia is being continued. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending. The plan is to continue IV vancomycin (Day 7) at a dose of 1g q24hours, checking vancomycin trough tonight at 6 PM before the next dose. IV Flagyl (Day 13) and PO vancomycin (Day"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with admission with respiratory failure now with proloned
   course of persistent ventilatory failure and with prolonged hospital
   course patient has now evolved persistent fevers throughout weekend
   despite continued antibiotics Rx with ventilator associated pneumonia
   as most likley explanation for persistent fevers at this time.  His
   requirements for elevated levels of PEEP do remain in the setting of
   obesity and inability to maintain adequate oxygentation in the setting
   PEEP decrease which may be to the point of negative end expiratory
   pressure and end expiration with PEEP <13.  Ppl is likely 15-16 given
   the findings with PEEP titration.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with clear and persistent requirement for
   increased PEEP in the setting of likely very unfavorable chest wall
   mechanics.  We have maintained patient as negative in fluid balance as
   possible in the setting of rising creatinine.  With his recurrent
   fevers will have to continue Rx for VAP.
   -Patient [**Name (NI) 6524**] to recover favorable chest wall mechanics
   -Wean PEEP as possible
   -Continue with PSV
   -Secretions limited
   2)Sepsis-
   -Vanco po for C. Diff and will continue 14 days beyond last antibiotics
   day for VAP
   -Vanco/Zosyn IV for VAP and suspected bacteremia
   -Sinusitis Rx completed
   -Will continue for 14 day period of Zosyn
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Keep I/O even
   -Follow creatinine
   -Renally dose all meds
   -Lasix dosing to even fluid balance.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a prolonged course of persistent ventilatory failure and a hospital course complicated by respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition has not improved despite receiving appropriate antibiotics for VAP. The patient also has a history of obesity, which makes it difficult to maintain adequate oxygenation with decreased levels of PEEP. 

The patient's vital signs show tachypnea, fever, and low blood pressure. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, and lactic acid. The patient's electrolytes show hypokalemia (low potassium) and hypernatremia (high sodium). 

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive fluid balance of 3,408 mL since midnight. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 13 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. 

The patient's physical examination reveals dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds on the chest, as well as 2+ edema in the extremities"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops sat when PEEP weaned.
   Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but no AS, AR, decreased
   LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent, persistent pleural
   effusions/pulmonary edema. Believe that pt is not yet eligible for
   tracheostomy due to high PEEP and risk associated with accompanying G
   tube placement.   Will sit patient upright in order to increase
   compliance and decrease PEEP, as patient may have negative end pleural
   pressures.
   - Trach and PEG today with thoracics
   - Transition from  bed to chair
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Difficulty diuresing b/c of increasing creatinine. Will diurese 1L as
   tolerated.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Fever: Patient had low-grade fevers.  Started Zosyn for G+ cocci in
   sputum and fevers in spite of current antibiotic coverage with PO vanco
   and IV Flagyl for CDiff and IV vanc for Coagulase negative Staph
   bacteremia.  For his sinusitis per CT, we had been treating with
   augmentin PO but will d/c this b/c of adequate coverage with unasyn.
   To note, prior CT abdomen [**10-18**] showed diverticulosis but no
   diverticulitis, gall bladder and pancreas were unremarkable.  Patient
   has new lines, decreasing risk of line infections.
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 8)  for bacteremia, switch dose to 1g q
   24hours, checking vanco trough
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 14), PO vancomycin (Day 14) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Renal failure
   improved when diuresis was held.  Has had similar episode over past 3
   days.   Urine lytes and calculated FE urea again suggest pre-renal
   etiology.  Creatinine had gone up to 2.1, now back down to 1.8
   -          Follow PM lytes.
   -      D/c Lasix drip.  Bolus Lasix 80 mg IV x 1 this AM, recheck in PM
   for creatinine rise
   # DM: ISS. Elevated blood sugars.
   -Increase fixed Lantus dose.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation given potential trach in next few days.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He was admitted with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has developed various complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to acute shortness of breath. He has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode. The respiratory support is necessary due to his underlying morbid obesity, chronic fever, pulmonary hypertension, and persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema.

2. Fever: The patient has had persistent low-grade fevers, which indicate an ongoing infection. He has been treated with antibiotics for gram-positive cocci in the sputum and fevers. There is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has been fluctuating, with an initial creatinine level of approximately 1.2, which worsened to 2.3 and then improved. This suggests pre-renal etiology. The patient may require careful monitoring of fluid balance and renal function.

4. Diabetic issues: The patient has elevated blood sugars, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. His insulin dose needs to be adjusted accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops sat when PEEP weaned.
   Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but no AS, AR, decreased
   LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent, persistent pleural
   effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting trial well, with good
   tidal volumes and O2 saturation.
   - Trach and PEG today with thoracics
   - Transition from  bed to chair
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Hold diuresis until post-procedure, to avoid hypotension and
   peri-operative excess fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but has
   been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started over the weekend.
   i.  VAP- Started Zosyn empiric coverage of VAP, given increasing
   secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that did not
   appear on sputum.  G+ cocci in sputum should be covered with
   Vancomycin.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, day 8.  Last vanco
   trough was therapeutic after dose was held [**1-14**] decreased renal function
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn.  Most organisms should be covered with
   Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco
   - Continue blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 8)  for bacteremia, switch dose to 1g q
   24hours,
   - ID approval per Zosyn
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 14), PO vancomycin (Day 14) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal
   insufficiency likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now back down to 1.8.
   Patient did well on Lasix boluses.
   -          Follow PM lytes.
   -          Hold lasix boluses until after the procedure.  Resume
   depending on fluid status, BP, and creatinine.
   # DM: ISS. Elevated blood sugars.
   -half-dose glargine today, given that patient is having tube feeds held
   and had been getting insulin sliding scale.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation given potential trach in next few days.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]
   Dispo: begin screening for rehab facilities.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient has had persistent respiratory failure, chronic fever, and multiple infections. He also has chronic issues with normocytic anemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, and morbid obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced persistent respiratory failure due to factors such as chronic fever, infections, and morbid obesity.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened from approximately 1.2 to 2.3, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal causes, and the patient's fluid status, blood pressure, and creatinine levels need to be closely monitored.

3. Diabetic Mellitus: The patient has elevated blood sugars, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Insulin therapy needs to be managed carefully, especially during periods of NPO (nothing by mouth).

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has had episodes of coagulation issues, including bacteremia and positive stool toxin for Clostridium difficile infection. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.

5. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops sat when PEEP weaned.
   Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but no AS, AR, decreased
   LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent, persistent pleural
   effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting trial well, with good
   tidal volumes and O2 saturation.
   - Trach and PEG today with thoracics
   - Transition from  bed to chair
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Hold diuresis until post-procedure, to avoid hypotension and
   peri-operative excess fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   # Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but has
   been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started over the weekend.
   i.  VAP- Started Zosyn empiric coverage of VAP, given increasing
   secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that did not
   appear on sputum.  G+ cocci in sputum should be covered with
   Vancomycin.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, day 8.  Last vanco
   trough was therapeutic after dose was held [**1-14**] decreased renal function
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn.  Most organisms should be covered with
   Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco
   - Continue blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 8)  for bacteremia, switch dose to 1g q
   24hours,
   - ID approval per Zosyn
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 14), PO vancomycin (Day 14) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   # Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal
   insufficiency likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now back down to 1.8.
   Patient did well on Lasix boluses.
   -          Follow PM lytes.
   -          Hold lasix boluses until after the procedure.  Resume
   depending on fluid status, BP, and creatinine.
   # DM: ISS. Elevated blood sugars.
   -half-dose glargine today, given that patient is having tube feeds held
   and had been getting insulin sliding scale.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation given potential trach in next few days.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]
   Dispo: begin screening for rehab facilities.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. The patient presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequently developed respiratory failure.

The patient has had persistent respiratory failure and chronic fever. The possible causes for respiratory failure include CHF, fluid overload, and morbid obesity. The patient has also shown signs of mild pulmonary hypertension but no aortic or mitral stenosis, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction contributing to difficulty in weaning off the ventilator, and persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema.

The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia, sinusitis, and Clostridium difficile infection. Treatment plans have been initiated for these conditions, including the administration of appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure with fluctuating renal insufficiency, possibly due to pre-renal causes. The patient's blood sugars have been elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

The patient also has normocytic anemia, which is a chronic issue. There is a suspicion of an underlying cause such as iron deficiency anemia or chronic disease. The patient's proptosis is stable, and imaging studies do not show any lytic lesions or"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with signfiicant history of obesity and with persistent
   respiratory failure now requiring trach and PEG to allow long term
   ventilator wean and support.  Encouraging is the fact that he has been
   able to tolerate PSV wean and PEEP decrease to 12 today.  He has no
   evidence of evolution of significant new positive cultures.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Certainly pneumonia may well be contributing in
   addition to volume overload and obesity.  Will continue to attempt
   diuresis and mobilization to facilitate wean of ventilatory support.
Continue diuresis
   -Mobilize patient when able following tracheostomy tube placement
   -Continue Rx for pneumonia
   2)Sepsis-He has multiple active sources of what may be ICU related
   infections which at this point do appear to be reasonably controlled
   -Catheter related blood stream infection-Vanco IV for coag negative
   staph bactermia
   -Ventilator Associated Pneumonia-ZOsyn/Vanco IV continuing
   -C. Diff--Flagyl IV and Vanco PO
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -continue with sedation wean as tolerated and will move to daily
   wake-ups with airway stabilized

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a significant history of obesity, persistent respiratory failure, and the need for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) to allow for long-term ventilator wean and support. The patient has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) wean and PEEP decrease to 12. There is no evidence of significant new positive cultures.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may have pneumonia contributing to respiratory failure, along with volume overload and obesity. Diuresis and mobilization will continue to facilitate wean of ventilatory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient has multiple active sources of ICU-related infections, which appear to be reasonably controlled. These include catheter-related bloodstream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile infection. Antibiotic therapy will be continued.
3. Altered Mental Status: Sedation wean will continue as tolerated, and daily wake-ups with airway stabilization will be implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure may worsen due to pneumonia, volume overload, and obesity. Weaning off the ventilator and managing respiratory support will be crucial.
2. Sepsis: The patient's multiple active sources of ICU-related infections increase the risk of sepsis. Continued antibiotic therapy and infection control measures are essential.
3. Altered Mental Status: Weaning off"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops sat when PEEP weaned.
   Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but no AS, AR, decreased
   LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent, persistent pleural
   effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting trial well, with good
   tidal volumes and O2 saturation.
   - Trach and PEG today with thoracics
   - Transition from  bed to chair
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Hold diuresis until post-procedure, to avoid hypotension and
   peri-operative excess fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   #2  Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but
   has been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started over the weekend.
   i.  VAP- Started Zosyn empiric coverage of VAP, given increasing
   secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that did not
   appear on sputum.  G+ cocci in sputum should be covered with
   Vancomycin.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, day 8.  Last vanco
   trough was therapeutic after dose was held [**1-14**] decreased renal function
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn.  Most organisms should be covered with
   Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco
   - Continue blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 9)  for bacteremia, switched dose to 1g q
   24hours,
   - ID approval per Zosyn
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 15), PO vancomycin (Day 15) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal
   insufficiency likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now back down to 1.6.
   Patient did well on Lasix boluses.
   -          Follow PM lytes.
   -          Hold lasix boluses until after the procedure.  Resume
   depending on fluid status, BP, and creatinine.
   # DM: ISS. Elevated blood sugars.
   -patient NPO, hold ISS.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation given potential trach in next few days.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]
   Dispo: begin screening for rehab facilities.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure, which has persisted along with chronic fever.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator, with decreased tidal volumes and oxygen saturation when PEEP is weaned. There are mild pulmonary hypertension and persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema. The patient is planned for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today.

2. Fever: The patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but has been afebrile for two days since starting Zosyn empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The VAP is suspected due to increasing secretions and fever.

3. Coag-negative staph bacteremia: The patient had positive blood cultures for coag-negative staph bacteremia, which was treated with intravenous vancomycin. The dose of vancomycin was held due to decreased renal function.

4. C. difficile infection: The patient has a positive stool toxin for Clostridium difficile infection, being treated with intravenous Flagyl and oral vancomycin.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline renal function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has had persistent respiratory failure and chronic fever. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, haloperidol, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure despite being on mechanical ventilation. The main contributing factors include morbid obesity, chronic fluid overload, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period and has developed a fever, suggesting a possible infection. Empiric coverage for VAP has been started with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
3. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia: The patient developed bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. Vancomycin therapy was initiated and continued due to persistent bacteremia.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient tested positive for C. difficile toxin, indicating a possible infection. Treatment with oral vancomycin and metronidazole has been initiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, atrial fibrillation, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, chronic respiratory failure, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU and is being treated for fever of unknown origin, electrolyte imbalances, and gastrointestinal issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and daily evaluation of secretions should be done to prevent and detect early signs of VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings, early ambulation, and subcutaneous heparin may be necessary to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and mechanical ventilation can lead to stress-related mucosal damage, resulting in stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists may be prescribed for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
4. Renal failure: The patient has pre-existing renal failure, and the use of nephrotoxic medications or ongoing renal dysfunction may worsen renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance is essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with persistent respiratory failure and ongoing attempts at
   diuresis.  He has had minimal tolerance of PEEP wean in the setting of
   persistent volume overload.  He has been able to maintain normal pH
   with elevated CO2 and has therefore struck a balance of chronic
   respiratory acidosis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Trach today
   -Move to PSV wean and trach mask trial
   -continue diuresis
   2)Volume Overload-
   -Continue to diurese as possible today when returning from procedure

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity.
   Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops sat when PEEP weaned.
   Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but no AS, AR, decreased
   LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent, persistent pleural
   effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting trial well, with good
   tidal volumes and O2 saturation.
   - Trach and PEG today with thoracics
   - Transition from  bed to chair
   -  Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Hold diuresis until post-procedure, to avoid hypotension and
   peri-operative excess fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   #2  Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but
   has been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started over the weekend.
   i.  VAP- Started Zosyn empiric coverage of VAP, given increasing
   secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that did not
   appear on sputum.  G+ cocci in sputum should be covered with
   Vancomycin.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, day 8.  Last vanco
   trough was therapeutic after dose was held [**1-14**] decreased renal function
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn.  Most organisms should be covered with
   Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco
   - Continue blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 9)  for bacteremia, switched dose to 1g q
   24hours,
   - ID approval per Zosyn
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 15), PO vancomycin (Day 15) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal
   insufficiency likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now back down to 1.6.
   Patient did well on Lasix boluses.
   -          Follow PM lytes.
   -          Hold lasix boluses until after the procedure.  Resume
   depending on fluid status, BP, and creatinine.
   # DM: ISS. Elevated blood sugars.
   -patient NPO, hold ISS.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation given potential trach in next few days.
   - Labetolol for nonspecific receptor control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF while intubated.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], New central line placed on [**10-24**]
   Dispo: begin screening for rehab facilities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, which has persisted despite interventions. The patient also has chronic fever, and multiple infections have been identified, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), coag-negative staph bacteremia, and Clostridium difficile infection. He has acute renal failure with fluctuating renal insufficiency, likely due to pre-renal causes. The patient's prothosis is normal to high, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. He has ischemic cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction of 60-70%. The patient is currently agitated and not following commands, likely due to language barriers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to chronic fever, multiple infections, and obesity. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to pulmonary hypertension and persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema.
2. Fever: The patient has had multiple low-grade fevers, which could be indicative of an ongoing infection. Empiric coverage for VAP has been initiated, and blood cultures are pending.
3. Coag-negative Staph Bacteremia: The patient had IV vancomycin held due to decreased renal function, but his last vanco trough was"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity,
   aspiration pneumonia.  Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops
   sat when PEEP weaned.  Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but
   no AS, AR, decreased LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent,
   persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting
   trial well, with good tidal volumes and O2 saturation.  Failed several
   attempts to ween PEEP, patient now w/tracheostomy and since procedure
   is back on CMV/Assist.  Received diuresis and recruit maneuvers with
   brief post-op episode of desaturation and sats improved.
   - CMV -> PSV at 10/18 as tolerated, re-check ABG in afternoon
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Diuresis as tolerated
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   #2  Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but
   had been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started.  Now w/low grade
   temp since yesterday afternoon.  BCx and UCx sent but its possible that
   fever is due to stress from procedure yesterday.
   i.  VAP- Started Zosyn empiric coverage of VAP, given increasing
   secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that did not
   appear on sputum.  G+ cocci in sputum should be covered with
   Vancomycin.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, day 8.  Last vanco
   trough was therapeutic after dose was held [**1-14**] decreased renal function
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn, ammoxicillin.  Most organisms should be
   covered with Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco
   - Continue blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 9)  for bacteremia, switched dose to 1g q
   24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 15), PO vancomycin (Day 15) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal
   insufficiency likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now back down to 1.6.
   Patient did well with Lasix boluses.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated
   # DM: ISS. Elevated blood sugars.
   - will increase ISS
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation because of severe nose bleed 2 weeks ago.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], Central line placed on [**10-24**]. For
   PICC attempt today. If unsuccessful, should go to IR tomorrow for PICC.
   Dispo: begin screening for rehab facilities.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 53-year-old obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction.
- He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, and has had persistent respiratory failure and chronic fever.
- He has been diagnosed with various conditions including chronic fever, respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, fluid overload, morbid obesity, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, uncontrolled diabetes, normocytic anemia, proptosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and gout.
- The patient has undergone several procedures including tracheostomy and Dobhoff placement.
- He has received multiple antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), coag-negative staph bacteremia, and Clostridium difficile infection.
- His vital signs are relatively stable, but he continues to have difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation due to pulmonary hypertension and persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema.
- The patient's renal function has fluctuated, but is currently stable.
- He is being closely monitored for potential complications and is receiving appropriate treatments for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of ongoing respiratory compromise.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's chronic lung infection and recent antibiotic use,"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with admission now dominated by prolonged ventilatory
   failure secondary to persistnet ventilatory failure and volume overload
   and renal failure. He has had successful placement of tracheostomy tube
   and G-tube was deferred with concern for proloned procedure and with
   significant risk of worsening atelectasis in the setting of PEEP wean
   prior to intervention.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with persistent ventilatory failure and
   now with collapse and effusion note in right hemi-thorax
   -Wean to PSV as tolerated
   -Hope to maintain PEEP and decrease PSV as patient able to in the
   setting of decrease in dead space expected with tracheostomy.
   -Move to PSV today
he has PEEP=18 and will change to PSV 28/18
   -Will need slow PEEP wean to allow recruitement of RLL
   -Bronchoscopy if unable to re-recruit
   2)Fever
post procedure and in the setting of new evolution of the right
   lower lobe collapse
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl/Vanco
   -Likley peri-procedure aspiration which is unavoidable + atelectasis
   -Will follow up culture results
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   _Cr. =1.7 and will keep I/O even today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone several procedures, including the placement of a tracheostomy tube and G-tube. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 18 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 95%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 144, and HCO3- of 72 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals dullness on percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lower lobe. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 339 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 149 mg/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.7 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hypokalemia (low potassium) and hypernatremia (high sodium). The patient also has an elevated lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L. Imaging shows severe worsening of the right lower lobe atelectasis and collapse.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to persistent ventilatory failure and volume overload, as well as renal failure. The patient's respiratory support is being weaned gradually, and bronchoscopy may be performed if recruitment of the right lower lobe is not achieved. The patient also has a fever, likely secondary to peri-procedure aspiration and atelectasis. Antibiotics have been started, and culture results are pending. The patient's acute renal failure is being managed with careful fluid balance and electrolyte monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of renal function, and electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity,
   aspiration pneumonia.  Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops
   sat when PEEP weaned.  Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but
   no AS, AR, decreased LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent,
   persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting
   trial well, with good tidal volumes and O2 saturation.  Failed several
   attempts to ween PEEP, patient now w/tracheostomy and since procedure
   is back on CMV/Assist.  Received diuresis and recruit maneuvers with
   brief post-op episode of desaturation and sats improved.
   - CMV -> PSV at 10/18 as tolerated, re-check ABG in afternoon
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Diuresis as tolerated
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   #2  Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but
   had been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started.  Now low grade temp
   x2 days, temp to 101.4 overnight..  BCx and UCx sent, due to height of
   fever and persistence, it is unlikely that it is due to stress from the
   procedure yesterday.
   I    VAP- Started Zosyn on [**10-28**] for empiric coverage of VAP, given
   increasing secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that
   did not appear on sputum.  Defervesed with addition of zosyn.  Now day
   6.  Re-assess endpoint when Cx from [**11-2**] are resulted.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, started [**10-24**], now
   day 10.  Re-assess endpoint when Cx from [**11-2**] are resulted.
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn, ammoxicillin.  Most organisms should be
   covered with Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco until 2 weeks after antibiotics d/c.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 10)  for bacteremia, switched dose to 1g
   q 24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 16), PO vancomycin (Day 16) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal
   insufficiency likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now 1.7.  Patient did well
   with Lasix boluses.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated
   # DM: ISS.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - Heparin gtt and re-assess for anticoagulation.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PICC placed by IR.
   Dispo: begin screening for rehab facilities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, which has persisted despite various interventions. He has had chronic fever, and multiple cultures have shown no growth, except for coag-negative staph bacteremia that is currently being treated with vancomycin. The patient also has a positive stool toxin for Clostridium difficile infection and is being treated with IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin. He has acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, proptosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, and morbid obesity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure persists despite being on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about weaning off the ventilator due to difficulty maintaining oxygen saturation and dealing with pleural effusions/pulmonary edema.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed a fever, and there is a concern for VAP. Empiric coverage with Zosyn has been started, and cultures are pending.
3. Coag-Negative Staph Bacteremia: The patient has a history of bacteremia with coag-negative staph, which is currently being treated with vancomycin.
4. Clostridium difficile"

   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity,
   aspiration pneumonia.  Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops
   sat when PEEP weaned.  Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but
   no AS, AR, decreased LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent,
   persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting
   trial well, with good tidal volumes and O2 saturation.  Failed several
   attempts to ween PEEP, patient now w/tracheostomy and since procedure
   is back on CMV/Assist.  Received diuresis and recruit maneuvers with
   brief post-op episode of desaturation and sats improved.
   - CMV -> PSV at 10/18 as tolerated, re-check ABG in afternoon
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Diuresis as tolerated
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   #2  Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but
   had been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started.  Now w/low grade
   temp since yesterday afternoon.  BCx and UCx sent but its possible that
   fever is due to stress from procedure yesterday.
   i.  VAP- Started Zosyn empiric coverage of VAP, given increasing
   secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that did not
   appear on sputum.  G+ cocci in sputum should be covered with
   Vancomycin.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, day 8.  Last vanco
   trough was therapeutic after dose was held [**1-14**] decreased renal function
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn, ammoxicillin.  Most organisms should be
   covered with Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco
   - Continue blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 9)  for bacteremia, switched dose to 1g q
   24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 15), PO vancomycin (Day 15) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal
   insufficiency likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now back down to 1.6.
   Patient did well with Lasix boluses.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated
   # DM: ISS. Elevated blood sugars.
   - will increase ISS
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - hold on anticoagulation because of severe nose bleed 2 weeks ago.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow.
   PPX: Heparin SQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PIVs, A-line replaced [**10-26**], Central line placed on [**10-24**]. For
   PICC attempt today. If unsuccessful, should go to IR tomorrow for PICC.
   Dispo: begin screening for rehab facilities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, for which he was admitted to the ICU. The patient has had persistent respiratory failure, chronic fever, and multiple infections. He has also experienced acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, proptosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, morbid obesity, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to chronic fever, aspiration pneumonia, CHF, fluid overload, and morbid obesity. Weaning from mechanical ventilation has been difficult, and the patient has experienced episodes of desaturation during PEEP weaning. Tracheostomy has been performed, and the patient is currently on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) with assist.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed low-grade fever, increasing secretions, and worsening oxygenation, which may indicate VAP. Empiric coverage with Zosyn has been started, and blood cultures are pending.

3. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia: The patient had a positive blood culture for coag-negative staphylococci, and IV vancomycin has been initiated. Vancom"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo patient admitted initially with sepsis and renal failure now with
   tracheostomy completed and ongoing issues of recurrent fevers and
   difficult to wean ventilator support in the setting of mild residual
   volume overload and likely significant contribution of restriction from
   body habitus.
   1)Respiratory Failure-continue with PEEP titration
   -Will move to wean PEEP as we are able to improve patient position
   -Trial decrease to 16 today
   -7.48/48/89
   -He has evidence of improved effective ventilation as seen with
   decreased in CO2 in the setting of stable minute ventilation.
   -Will expect to maintain baseline CO2 at 48-50
   2)Acute Renal Failure-Baseline creatinine has been reasonably stable at
   1.6-1.8 which is a modest elevation over pre-morbid baseline.
   -Keep fluid balance negative
   3)Fever-Patient with recurrent fever noted overnight.  He has had
   extensive evaluation for possible sources and VAP and catheter related
   blood stream infection in addition to sinusitis were all suspected and
   treated.  In the setting
   -Zosyn/Flagyl
   -NaCl nasal spray continuing
   -Will need to re-culture in the setting of new fevers.
   -Will check fungal isolators

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity,
   aspiration pneumonia.  Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops
   sat when PEEP weaned.  Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but
   no AS, AR, decreased LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent,
   persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting
   trial well, with good tidal volumes and O2 saturation.  Failed several
   attempts to ween PEEP, patient now w/tracheostomy and since procedure
   is back on PSV.  Received diuresis and recruit maneuvers with brief
   post-op episode of desaturation and sats improved.
   - wean PEEP
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated; consider haldol if needed
   for agitation.
   - Hold diuresis today due to elevated creatinine
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Consider cardiology consult to advise regarding CHF contribution.
   .
   #2  Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but
   had been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started.  Now low grade temp
   x2 days, temp to 101.4 overnight..  BCx and UCx sent, due to height of
   fever and persistence, it is unlikely that it is due to stress from the
   procedure yesterday.  Has been afebrile overnight.
   I    VAP- Started Zosyn on [**10-28**] for empiric coverage of VAP, given
   increasing secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that
   did not appear on sputum.  Defervesed with addition of zosyn.  Now day
   8.  Re-assess endpoint when Cx from [**11-2**] are resulted.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, started [**10-24**], now
   day 11.  Re-assess endpoint when Cx from [**11-2**] are resulted.
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn, ammoxicillin.  Most organisms should be
   covered with Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco until 2 weeks after antibiotics d/c.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (started [**10-24**], Day 11)  for bacteremia,
   switched dose to 1g q 24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl (started [**10-18**], Day 17), PO vancomycin (started
   [**10-18**] Day 17) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline; 1.2 on admission but has
   been in the 1.6
 2.0 range for the past year.  Was stable on
   admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal insufficiency
   likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now 1.8.  Patient did well with Lasix
   boluses.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure, leading to chronic fever. He has been in the ICU for several days, requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, fever, coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia, sinusitis, Clostridium difficile infection, acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, proptosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function remains compromised, with difficulty weaning off the ventilator and persistent pulmonary hypertension.
2. Infection: The patient has had multiple infections, including VAP, bacteremia, sinusitis, and C. difficile infection. He continues to be at risk for further infections due to prolonged ICU stay and immunosuppression.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has fluctuated, with elevated creatinine levels. He requires close monitoring of renal parameters and careful management of fluid balance.
4. Normocytic anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may contribute to his overall weakness and fatigue.
5. Proptosis: The patient has proptosis, which requires further evaluation to determine the underlying"

   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity,
   aspiration pneumonia.  Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops
   sat when PEEP weaned.  Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but
   no AS, AR, decreased LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent,
   persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting
   trial well, with good tidal volumes and O2 saturation.  Failed several
   attempts to ween PEEP, patient now w/tracheostomy and since procedure
   is back on CMV/Assist.  Received diuresis and recruit maneuvers with
   brief post-op episode of desaturation and sats improved.
   - CMV -> PSV at 10/18 as tolerated, re-check ABG in afternoon
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - Diuresis as tolerated
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - PM lytes, follow creatinine.
   #2  Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but
   had been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started.  Now low grade temp
   x2 days, temp to 101.4 overnight..  BCx and UCx sent, due to height of
   fever and persistence, it is unlikely that it is due to stress from the
   procedure yesterday.
   I    VAP- Started Zosyn on [**10-28**] for empiric coverage of VAP, given
   increasing secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that
   did not appear on sputum.  Defervesed with addition of zosyn.  Now day
   6.  Re-assess endpoint when Cx from [**11-2**] are resulted.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, started [**10-24**], now
   day 10.  Re-assess endpoint when Cx from [**11-2**] are resulted.
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn, ammoxicillin.  Most organisms should be
   covered with Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco until 2 weeks after antibiotics d/c.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (Day 10)  for bacteremia, switched dose to 1g
   q 24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl (Day 16), PO vancomycin (Day 16) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline, but likely approximately
   1.2.  Was stable on admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal
   insufficiency likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now 1.7.  Patient did well
   with Lasix boluses.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated
   # DM: ISS.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - Heparin gtt and re-assess for anticoagulation.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity,
   aspiration pneumonia.  Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops
   sat when PEEP weaned.  Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but
   no AS, AR, decreased LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent,
   persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction.
- He presented with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure.
- The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, with persistent respiratory failure and chronic fever.
- He has multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure, fluid overload, morbid obesity, and aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient has had difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation due to pulmonary hypertension, but tolerated a sitting trial well.
- He has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, diuresis, recruitment maneuvers, and antibiotic therapy.
- The patient's recent labs show elevated creatinine levels, leading to holding diuretics.
- His fever has recurred, and blood cultures have shown coag-negative staph bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin.
- The patient also has sinusitis, C. difficile infection, and acute renal failure.
- Other ongoing issues include diabetes mellitus, normocytic anemia, proptosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, and morbid obesity.
- The patient is currently receiving various medications, including labetalol for rate control in atrial fibrillation, allopurinol for gout, and antibiotics for infections.
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 126/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has recurrent fevers, positive blood cultures indicating coag-negative staph bacteremia and C. difficile infection, suggesting an ongoing risk for infections.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's fluctuating renal insufficiency and elevated creatinine levels indicate a risk for worsening renal function.
4. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient's history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy put him at risk for further cardiac complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to thromboembolic events if not adequately anticoagulated.
6. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent fluctuations in blood pressure suggest ongoing cardiovascular risks.
7. Morbid Obesity: The patient's morbid obesity contributes to hypoventilation syndrome and increases the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Likely from aspiration of blood
   from nose bleeds.  Chronic respiratory failure from CHF, fluid
   overload, obesity also contributing.
   - will increase PEEP to attempt to open more alveoli and re-recruit
   - continue Zosyn (started [**10-28**]) for VAP empiric coverage, today is day
   9
   - continue Vancomycin, (started [**10-24**]) coverage both VAP and staph
   bacteremia, today is day 12
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine
   - wean fentanyl and versed, on Haldol 5mg PO BID for agitation, monitor
   ECGs while on Haldol
   - discuss overall status with family today
   .
   #2  Fever: Had been febrile for most of stay, was afebrile X 2 after
   Zosyn started.  Was febrile around peg placement.  Now afebrile X 2
   days.
   I    VAP- Started Zosyn on [**10-28**] for empiric coverage of VAP, given
   increasing secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that
   did not appear on sputum.  Defervesed with addition of zosyn.  Now day
   9.  Re-assess endpoint as now has respiratory decompensation with
   likely aspiration of blood.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, started [**10-24**], now
   day 12.  Covering VAP and bacteremia.
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn, ammoxicillin.  Most organisms should be
   covered with Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   15), PO vanco until 2 weeks after antibiotics d/c.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (started [**10-24**], Day 12)  for bacteremia,
   switched dose to 1g q 24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl (started [**10-18**], Day 18), PO vancomycin (started
   [**10-18**] Day 18) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline; 1.2 on admission but has
   been in the 1.6
 2.0 range for the past year.  Was stable on
   admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal insufficiency
   likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now 1.5.  Patient did well with Lasix
   boluses.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Will increase sliding scale today.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - Heparin gtt and re-assess for anticoagulation.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   ..
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin gtt, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PICC placed by IR.
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a past cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath, leading to respiratory failure. He has been experiencing chronic fever, and there are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), coag-neg staph bacteremia, and sinusitis. The patient also has acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, proptosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, gout, and hypervolemic extravascular fluid status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Decompensation: The patient has experienced acute respiratory decompensation due to likely aspiration of blood from nosebleeds. Chronic respiratory failure from congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and obesity may also contribute. The plan includes increasing PEEP to attempt to open more alveoli and re-recruit them, continuing Zosyn for VAP coverage, and weaning fentanyl and versed while monitoring ECGs on Haldol.

2. Fever: The patient has been febrile for most of his stay, but was afebrile for two days after starting Zosyn. He was also febrile around peg placement. Now he is afebrile for two days. VAP was started on Zosyn on [**Month (only) 60**] for empirical coverage of VAP, given increasing secretions and fever. The patient defervesced with the addition of Zosyn. Re-assessment endpoint now has respiratory decompensation with likely aspiration of blood.

3. Coag-Neg Staph Bacteremia: IV vancomycin, started on [**10-24**], is being continued for bacteremia, covering VAP and bacteremia. 

4. Sinusitis: The patient's sinusitis has been discontinued.

5. Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient has a positive stool toxin, indicating C. diff. He is being treated with IV Flagyl (day 15), and PO vancomycin until two weeks after antibiotics discontinuation.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has fluctuated, with unclear baseline. He had stable creatinine levels on admission, but they worsened to 2.3. Fluctuating renal insufficiency is likely pre-renal causes. The plan includes continuing to follow PM lytes and administering Lasix boluses as tolerated.

7. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient is on insulin sliding scale and glargine.

8. Normocytic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which is likely due to iron deficiency and chronic disease. There was a bleeding episode, but his hematocrit (Hct) is stable.

9. Proptosis: The patient has pro"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Respiratory failure:  [**1-14**] CHF, fluid overload, morbid obesity,
   aspiration pneumonia.  Patient loses volume with weaning trials, drops
   sat when PEEP weaned.  Patient with mild pulmonary hyper tension, but
   no AS, AR, decreased LVEF to contribute to difficulty in weaning vent,
   persistent pleural effusions/pulmonary edema. Pt tolerated sitting
   trial well, with good tidal volumes and O2 saturation.  Failed several
   attempts to ween PEEP, patient now w/tracheostomy and since procedure
   is back on PSV.  Received diuresis and recruit maneuvers with brief
   post-op episode of desaturation and sats improved.
   - wean PEEP
   - Wean fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated; consider haldol if needed
   for agitation.
   - Hold diuresis today due to elevated creatinine
   - Continue Ipratroprium/Albuterol for possible bronchospastic component
   - Consider cardiology consult to advise regarding CHF contribution.
   .
   #2  Fever: Patient has had multiple infections, low-grade fevers, but
   had been afebrile x 2 days since Zosyn was started.  Now low grade temp
   x2 days, temp to 101.4 overnight..  BCx and UCx sent, due to height of
   fever and persistence, it is unlikely that it is due to stress from the
   procedure yesterday.  Has been afebrile overnight.
   I    VAP- Started Zosyn on [**10-28**] for empiric coverage of VAP, given
   increasing secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that
   did not appear on sputum.  Defervesed with addition of zosyn.  Now day
   8.  Re-assess endpoint when Cx from [**11-2**] are resulted.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, started [**10-24**], now
   day 11.  Re-assess endpoint when Cx from [**11-2**] are resulted.
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn, ammoxicillin.  Most organisms should be
   covered with Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   14), PO vanco until 2 weeks after antibiotics d/c.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (started [**10-24**], Day 11)  for bacteremia,
   switched dose to 1g q 24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl (started [**10-18**], Day 17), PO vancomycin (started
   [**10-18**] Day 17) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline; 1.2 on admission but has
   been in the 1.6
 2.0 range for the past year.  Was stable on
   admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal insufficiency
   likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now 1.8.  Patient did well with Lasix
   boluses.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct stable.
   -          Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - Heparin gtt and re-assess for anticoagulation.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive.  Initially hypertensive then
   hypotensive.
   - Continue diuresis as able
   - labetalol as above
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   # Morbid Obesity: Likely contributing to overall hypoventilation
   syndrome.  This is a chronic outpatient issue.
   - Nutrition consult post-extubation
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin gtt, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PICC placed by IR.
   Dispo: begin screening for rehab facilities.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, cocaine-induced myocardial infarction, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute shortness of breath and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing chronic fever, and multiple infections have been identified, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), coag-negative staph bacteremia, and Clostridium difficile infection. He also has acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, proptosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's obesity and chronic respiratory failure pose a risk for continued difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. The presence of pleural effusions and pulmonary edema may contribute to this issue.

2. Fever: The patient's persistent low-grade fever suggests an ongoing infection. Given his history of multiple infections, including VAP and bacteremia, it is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's fluctuating renal function indicates acute renal failure. Pre-renal causes such as hypovolemia and hypotension should be considered, along with possible intrinsic renal damage. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal function is essential.

4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's diabetes should be managed with appropriate insulin therapy and blood glucose monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Likely from aspiration of blood
   from nose bleeds.  Chronic respiratory failure from CHF, fluid
   overload, obesity also contributing.  PEEP now up to 22, O2 sat
   improved.
   - will wean PEEP as tolerated
   - continue Zosyn (started [**10-28**]) for VAP empiric coverage, today is day
   [**9-26**]
   - continue Vancomycin, (started [**10-24**]) coverage both VAP and staph
   bacteremia, today is day 13
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine
   - wean fentanyl and versed, on Haldol 5mg PO BID for agitation, monitor
   ECGs while on Haldol
   - add PRN Haldol to help with agitation from fentanyl weaning.
   .
   #2  Fever: Had been febrile for most of stay, was afebrile X 2 after
   Zosyn started.  Was febrile around peg placement.  Now afebrile X 4
   days.
   I    VAP- Started Zosyn on [**10-28**] for empiric coverage of VAP, given
   increasing secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that
   did not appear on sputum.  Defervesed with addition of zosyn.  Now day
   10.  Re-assess endpoint as now has respiratory decompensation with
   likely aspiration of blood.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, started [**10-24**], now
   day 13.  Covering VAP and bacteremia.
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn, ammoxicillin.  Most organisms should be
   covered with Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   15), PO vanco until 2 weeks after antibiotics d/c.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (started [**10-24**], Day 13)  for bacteremia,
   switched dose to 1g q 24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl (started [**10-18**], Day 19), PO vancomycin (started
   [**10-18**] Day 19) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   - Continue screening cultures.
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline; 1.2 on admission but has
   been in the 1.6
 2.0 range for the past year.  Was stable on
   admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal insufficiency
   likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now 1.6 and stable.  Patient did well
   with Lasix boluses.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Will increase sliding scale today.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct dropped 1 point yesterday, likely due to acute bleed.
   -heparin ggt off
 not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat
   bleeds.
   -Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   ..
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin gtt, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PICC placed by IR.
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese man with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath, leading to respiratory failure. He has had persistent respiratory failure and chronic fever. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory decompensation, likely due to aspiration of blood from nosebleeds, chronic respiratory failure from congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and obesity. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV mode, PEEP of 22 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and has an ABG showing a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 59 mmHg, PaO2 of 175, and HCO3- of 38 mEq/L. His vital signs include a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 107/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature of 36.6°C. The patient has a history of fever, which has responded to antibiotics. He also has anemia, renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, proptosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, gout, and sinusitis. He is currently receiving multiple medications and treatments for various conditions.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation, diastolic congestive heart failure, and respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy. She experienced a deterioration overnight with nosebleed and hypoxemia. Her PEEP was increased to 22, and she showed left lung opacification on the chest X-ray. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) from yesterday showed pH 7.39, PaCO2 59, and PaO2 105. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 114/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has atrial fibrillation (AF) as her heart rhythm.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 30 mmHg, total input of 4,219 mL, total output of 2,510 mL, and fluid balance of 1,709 mL positive. She is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions, as well as various other medications such as ranitidine, heparin, and vancomycin.

Her physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, crackles in both lung fields, and warm skin. Neurologic assessment is not available due to the patient's inability to stand or respond.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), respiratory failure, and a tracheostomy in place. She experienced a deterioration overnight with nosebleed and hypoxemia, leading to an increase in PEEP to 22. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) from yesterday showed a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 59 mmHg, and PaO2 of 105 mmHg.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has allergies to Capoten.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 79 bpm with a range of 69-85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/70 mmHg to 141/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with inspiration, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 30 mmHg, and fluid balance shows a total input of 4,219 mL and output of 2,510 mL since 12 AM.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 522 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 22 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32 cmH2O. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, and PaO2 of 105 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, crackles in both lung fields, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and inability to stand due to muscle weakness. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), with slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), slightly elevated creatinine (Cr), and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute on chronic respiratory failure due to OHS, CHF, and VAP. The plan involves weaning PEEP, continuing diuresis for CHF, and long-term antibiotic therapy for VAP. Sedation is to be weaned as tolerated, and anticoagulation should be held due to the patient's AF.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of heart function leading to cardiogenic shock, development of septicemia or other infections due to prolonged ICU stay and antibiotic therapy, and potential bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Likely from mucous plugging or
   blood in airways given that patient has markedly improved both
   clinically and radiographically.  Chronic respiratory failure from CHF,
   fluid overload, obesity also contributing.  PEEP has been weaned to 18
   with O2 sats stable.
   - will wean PEEP as tolerated
   - will stop abxs now as today is day [**10-27**] for Zosyn and 14/14 for
   Vancomycin and these may be contributing to drug fevers
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine to improve
   respiratory status
   - wean fentanyl and versed, on Haldol 5mg PO BID for agitation, monitor
   ECGs while on Haldol
   - add PRN Haldol to help with agitation from fentanyl weaning.
   .
   #2  Fever: newly febrile again today although this is not clearly
   infectious as pt has negative cultures, negative sputum samples.  Also
   may be due to aspiration of blood, pneumonitis and inflammation.
   Patient as completed 11 day course of Zosyn ([**Date range (1) 6666**]) and 14 day
   course of Vancomycin ([**Date range (1) 6667**]) Vanco was for Coag negative Staph
   bacteremia on [**10-24**] and empiric VAP coverage.  Continues to be treated
   with IV Flagyl and PO Vanco for C. Diff.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (started [**10-24**], Day 13)  for bacteremia,
   switched dose to 1g q 24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other abxs
   stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-10-21**]
   - Continue PO vancomycin started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other
   abxs stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-10-21**]
   - Tylenol PRN
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline; 1.2 on admission but has
   been in the 1.6
 2.0 range for the past year.  Was stable on
   admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal insufficiency
   likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Slightly up at 1.8 today.  Will continue
   to monitor.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated, got 80mg IV Lasix today
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   ..
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin gtt, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PICC placed by IR.
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient has had persistent respiratory failure, chronic fever, and mucous plugging or blood in the airways. The patient's respiratory status has improved with weaning of PEEP to 18 and stable oxygen saturation.

The patient is now febrile again, but cultures are negative, suggesting that the fever may be due to aspiration of blood, pneumonitis, and inflammation. The patient has completed an 11-day course of Zosyn and a 14-day course of Vancomycin for coag-negative Staph bacteremia on 10/24. He continues to be treated with IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin for Clostridium difficile.

The patient's acute renal failure is unclear, with fluctuating renal insufficiency likely due to pre-renal causes. His blood sugars have been in the normal range.

The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with prior MI, now with cocaine on the toxin screen. He is allergic to ACE inhibitors and has diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 60-70%. He may not benefit from afterload reduction. The patient's atrial fibrillation is on metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient, but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, heart failure (diastolic), renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure (acute and chronic), impaired skin integrity, and anxiety. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure within normal range, heart rate between 72-91 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is currently receiving several medications including midazolam, fentanyl, vancomycin, metronidazole, piperacillin, and Lasix. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated potassium levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection in the body. This could be due to a hospital-acquired infection or a worsening of the initial condition.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure (acute and chronic) and current ventilatory support suggest a potential risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory parameters is necessary.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's history of diastolic heart failure could lead to worsening cardiac output"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Likely from aspiration of blood
   from nose bleeds.  Chronic respiratory failure from CHF, fluid
   overload, obesity also contributing.  PEEP now up to 22, O2 sat
   improved.
   - will wean PEEP as tolerated
   - continue Zosyn (started [**10-28**]) for VAP empiric coverage, today is day
   [**9-26**]
   - continue Vancomycin, (started [**10-24**]) coverage both VAP and staph
   bacteremia, today is day 13
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine
   - wean fentanyl and versed, on Haldol 5mg PO BID for agitation, monitor
   ECGs while on Haldol
   - add PRN Haldol to help with agitation from fentanyl weaning.
   .
   #2  Fever: Had been febrile for most of stay, was afebrile X 2 after
   Zosyn started.  Was febrile around peg placement.  Now afebrile X 4
   days.
   I    VAP- Started Zosyn on [**10-28**] for empiric coverage of VAP, given
   increasing secretions and fever.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had GNRs deep in lungs that
   did not appear on sputum.  Defervesed with addition of zosyn.  Now day
   10.  Re-assess endpoint as now has respiratory decompensation with
   likely aspiration of blood.
   ii.  Coag negative staph bacteremia- IV vancomycin, started [**10-24**], now
   day 13.  Covering VAP and bacteremia.
   iii.  Sinusitis- d/c
d Unasyn, ammoxicillin.  Most organisms should be
   covered with Vanco and Zosyn
   iv.  C. diff- Positive stool toxin.  Being treated with IV Flagyl (day
   15), PO vanco until 2 weeks after antibiotics d/c.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (started [**10-24**], Day 13)  for bacteremia,
   switched dose to 1g q 24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl (started [**10-18**], Day 19), PO vancomycin (started
   [**10-18**] Day 19) for C. diff
   - Tylenol PRN
   - no vegetations seen on TTE but study is poor
 may consider TEE if
   has multiple other blood cultures positive
   - Continue screening cultures.
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline; 1.2 on admission but has
   been in the 1.6
 2.0 range for the past year.  Was stable on
   admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal insufficiency
   likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Now 1.6 and stable.  Patient did well
   with Lasix boluses.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Will increase sliding scale today.
   # Normocytic Anemia:  Chronic issue. Per labs, unclear, probably iron
   deficiency+ anemia chronic disease.  Had bleeding episode, cauterized
   by ENT. Hct dropped 1 point yesterday, likely due to acute bleed.
   -heparin ggt off
 not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat
   bleeds.
   -Continue to monitor HCT and bleeding.
   #Proptosis- Normal-high TSH, not c/w [**Doctor Last Name 598**].  Ddx includes infections
   (bacterial sinusitis, fungal invasion), infiltrative, neoplastic
   (lymphoma, leukemia).  CT imaging reassuring, with excess retro-orbital
   fat rather than lytic lesions or masses suspicious for tumor.  Per
   family is a long-standing issue.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   ..
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin gtt, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PICC placed by IR.
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities.

","The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presented with acute shortness of breath and subsequent respiratory failure. He has been febrile for most of his stay and was initially treated with vancomycin for suspected staphylococcal bacteremia. He also received Zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, lasix, and other ICU medications. 

The patient's physical examination reveals agitation, proptosis, tracheostomy with mild serosanguineous drainage, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, distended abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 113/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV with PEEP at 20 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%. His arterial blood gas shows pH 7.39, PaCO2 59 mmHg, HCO3- 117 mEq/L, SaO2 195, and Ve 7.5 L/min.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with respiratory failure, severe obesity, and several comorbidities including chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, Clostridium difficile infection, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, weaning peep, and difficulty breathing. He has multiple infusions including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and others. His vital signs show a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 114/71 mmHg to 142/87 mmHg, heart rate of 75-91 bpm, respiratory rate of 20-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and respiratory symptoms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and worsening respiratory symptoms may indicate this complication.
2. Acute on chronic heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, and his current symptoms could be due to an exacerbation of this condition. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is necessary.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient has a known CDI, which can lead to severe diarrhea and colitis. Continued treatment with vancomycin and"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w fluid overload, respiratory
   failure and chronic fever s/p CONS bacteremia not responsive to
   vancomycin/pip/tazo.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Acute likely [**1-14**] mucous plug.
   Chronic respiratory failure from CHF, fluid overload, obesity also
   contributing.  PEEP has been weaned to 18 with O2 sats stable.
   - will wean PEEP as tolerated, may increase FiO2 if needed to keep PEEP
   down.
   - Stopped Abx yesterday as completed empiric course for VAP
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine to improve
   respiratory status
   - Continue weaning fentanyl and versed, on Haldol 5mg PO BID for
   agitation, monitor ECGs while on Haldol
   - PRN Haldol to help with agitation from fentanyl weaning.
   .
   #2  Fever: Spiked through vanc/pip/tazo yesterday and continues febrile
   today although appears to be trending downward.   Considering length of
   Tx w/ Abx for VAP and CONS bacteremia continued spikes would likely
   represent either drug fever, sequestered source of infection (abscess,
   line, IE, clot), C. diff or noninfectious cause.  WBC trended down and
   remain down after stopping Abx.  Possibly infected central line site.
   - Pull central line send tip for culture
   - Consider TEE if continues febrile and/or repeat Bcx become positive.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - D/C IV Flagyl started [**10-18**]
   - Continue PO vancomycin started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other
   abxs stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-10-21**]
   - Tylenol PRN
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline; 1.2 on admission but has
   been in the 1.6
 2.0 range for the past year.  Appears to fluctuate
   significantly, may need to allow Cr to increase in order to wean from
   vent.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes while on Lasix drip.
   -          Lasix drip titrate to 130cc/hr UOP
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  CVP 24 but high PEEP contributing.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   ..
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin gtt, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with fluid overload, respiratory failure, and chronic fever following conservative bacteremia that was not responsive to vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Decompensation: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, and obesity. The acute decompensation is likely caused by a mucous plug. PEEP has been weaned to 18 cmH2O with oxygen saturation stable. It is planned to continue weaning PEEP as tolerated and increase FiO2 if necessary to maintain PEEP down. Antibiotics have been stopped as completed empiric course for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Diuretics will be continued to improve respiratory status, and weaning of fentanyl and versed will be done while monitoring for agitation. Haloperidol will be used for agitation during fentanyl weaning.

2. Fever: The patient's fever has spiked through vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam and continues to be febrile today. The fever may be due to drug fever or sequestered sources of infection such as abscess, line infection, infective endocarditis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w acute
   SOB, with resultant respiratory failure who has had persistent
   respiratory failure and chronic fever.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Likely from mucous plugging or
   blood in airways given that patient has markedly improved both
   clinically and radiographically.  Chronic respiratory failure from CHF,
   fluid overload, obesity also contributing.  PEEP has been weaned to 18
   with O2 sats stable.
   - will wean PEEP as tolerated
   - will stop abxs now as today is day [**10-27**] for Zosyn and 14/14 for
   Vancomycin and these may be contributing to drug fevers
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine to improve
   respiratory status
   - wean fentanyl and versed, on Haldol 5mg PO BID for agitation, monitor
   ECGs while on Haldol
   - add PRN Haldol to help with agitation from fentanyl weaning.
   .
   #2  Fever: newly febrile again today although this is not clearly
   infectious as pt has negative cultures, negative sputum samples.  Also
   may be due to aspiration of blood, pneumonitis and inflammation.
   Patient as completed 11 day course of Zosyn ([**Date range (1) 6666**]) and 14 day
   course of Vancomycin ([**Date range (1) 6667**]) Vanco was for Coag negative Staph
   bacteremia on [**10-24**] and empiric VAP coverage.  Continues to be treated
   with IV Flagyl and PO Vanco for C. Diff.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue vancomycin IV (started [**10-24**], Day 13)  for bacteremia,
   switched dose to 1g q 24hours,
   - Continue IV Flagyl started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other abxs
   stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-10-21**]
   - Continue PO vancomycin started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other
   abxs stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-10-21**]
   - Tylenol PRN
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline; 1.2 on admission but has
   been in the 1.6
 2.0 range for the past year.  Was stable on
   admission, then worsened to 2.3.  Fluctuating renal insufficiency
   likely [**1-14**] pre-renal causes.  Slightly up at 1.8 today.  Will continue
   to monitor.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes.
   -          Lasix bolus as tolerated, got 80mg IV Lasix today
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  ACE allergic, so no ACE.  Pt has diastolic dysfunction with EF
   60-70%, so may not benefit from afterload reduction.  Though he has
   room to increase beta blockade, given infection, will hold off on
   increasing beta blockade.  ECHO showed mild pulmonary hypertension and
   tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: On Metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
   Not anticoagulated [**1-14**] bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score
   is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   ..
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin gtt, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PICC placed by IR.
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction.
- He presented with acute shortness of breath, resulting in respiratory failure.
- He has been experiencing persistent respiratory failure and chronic fever.
- The patient is morbidly obese and has been on mechanical ventilation.
- He has received various antibiotics for suspected infections, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
- His recent laboratory results indicate worsening renal function, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient has shown signs of agitation and agitation-related complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Decompensation: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate due to factors such as mucous plugging, blood in the airways, chronic respiratory failure, and fluid overload.
2. Infection: Despite receiving multiple courses of antibiotics, the patient's fever persists. There is a risk of developing a new infection or resistant bacterial infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function is declining, which may be related to pre-renal causes, fluid overload, or direct kidney injury. This could lead to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid management challenges.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with obesity, hypoventilation, diastolic congestive heart failure, and respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has developed a fever and is showing signs of fluid overload. His blood pressure is within normal limits, but his heart rate and respiratory rate are slightly elevated. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 96%. He has an atrial fibrillation rhythm and a central venous pressure of 32 mmHg.

The patient has a history of several medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. He is on multiple medications, including antihypertensives, lipid-lowering agents, antidiabetics, and anticoagulants.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium. The patient also has low levels of albumin and hemoglobin. Imaging studies show evidence of pulmonary edema.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory failure requires continued mechanical ventilation. The plan is to wean the patient off positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) gradually. The patient is also experiencing fluid overload, so lasix will be restarted to promote diuresis.

The patient's fevers are unclear in origin, and it has been decided to remove the left subclavian line due to the presence of a picture. Empiric treatment for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) will be continued, and the patient will discontinue Flagyl while continuing with oral vancomycin.

Sedation weaning will continue, and the patient will be closely monitored for any complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w fluid overload, respiratory
   failure and chronic fever s/p CONS bacteremia not responsive to
   vancomycin/pip/tazo.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Acute likely [**1-14**] mucous plug.
   Chronic respiratory failure from CHF, fluid overload, obesity also
   contributing.  PEEP has been weaned to 18 with O2 sats stable.
   - will wean PEEP as tolerated, may increase FiO2 if needed to keep PEEP
   down.
   - Stopped Abx yesterday as completed empiric course for VAP
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine to improve
   respiratory status
   - Continue weaning fentanyl and versed, on Haldol 5mg PO BID for
   agitation, monitor ECGs while on Haldol
   - PRN Haldol to help with agitation from fentanyl weaning.
   .
   #2  Fever: Spiked through vanc/pip/tazo yesterday and continues febrile

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w fluid overload, respiratory
   failure and chronic fever s/p CONS bacteremia not responsive to
   vancomycin/pip/tazo.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Acute likely [**1-14**] mucous plug with
   contribution from large abdomen causing him to take small tidal volumes
   and possibly fatigue his respiratory mucles.   Chronic respiratory
   failure from CHF, fluid overload.  PEEP has been weaned to 16 but then
   he eventually becomes hypoxic taking small tidal volumes. Question as
   to whether his shifting his position and allowing his abdomen to
   compress his lungs or decreased PEEP is causing him to take small tidal
   volumes.
   - Bronch today to eval for mucous plugging
   - Attempt to keep him as upright as possible to keep is abdomen from
   compressing his chest
   - will wean PEEP as tolerated, may increase FiO2 if needed to keep PEEP
   down.
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine/BUN to
   improve respiratory status
   - Continue current doses of fentanyl and  versed and increase methadone
   as pt. appears uncomfortable.
   .
   #2  Fever: Spiked through vanc/pip/tazo and continues febrile today.
   Central line pulled yesterday but Pt. may have infected clot at site of
   line.
   - U/S of L subclavian
   - Consider TEE if continues febrile and/or repeat Bcx become positive.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - LFT
s, lipase to eval for intraabdominal source of infection
   - Continue PO vancomycin started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other
   abxs stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-11-20**]
   - Tylenol PRN
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline; 1.2 on admission but has
   been in the 1.6
 2.0 range for the past year.  Appears to fluctuate
   significantly, may need to allow Cr to increase in order to wean from
   vent.
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes while on Lasix drip.
   -          Lasix drip titrate to 130cc/hr UOP
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  CVP 24 but high PEEP contributing.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   ..
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin gtt, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with fluid overload, respiratory failure, and chronic fever secondary to community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia that has not responded to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, or metronidazole.

The patient's current medical conditions include acute respiratory decompensation, fever, acute renal failure, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. He is also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, gout, and hypervolemic extravascular fluid status.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.3°F, blood pressure ranging from 122/73 mmHg to 138/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 26 mmHg, and he is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 410 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 9 L/min.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.8 g/dL, blood glucose of 129 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 63 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 139 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.0 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 96 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 9.8 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.2 mg/dL, and phosphorus (PO4) of 5.5 mg/dL.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history include:

1. Acute respiratory decompensation: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a mucous plug obstruction in the airways, possibly exacerbated by his large abdomen compressing the lungs. There is a concern for chronic respiratory failure from congestive heart failure (CHF) and fluid overload.

2. Fever: The patient continues to have a fever despite previous antibiotic therapy, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The central line has been pulled, but there may be an infected clot at the site of the line. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and the baseline creatinine level is fluctuating. It is unclear whether this is a pre-existing condition or an acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function is essential.

4. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient's history of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction and current symptoms suggest compromised cardiac function. Management of his heart failure and optimization of cardiac support are necessary.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atr"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w fluid overload, respiratory
   failure and chronic fever s/p CONS bacteremia not responsive to
   vancomycin/pip/tazo.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Acute likely [**1-14**] mucous plug with
   contribution from large abdomen causing him to take small tidal volumes
   and possibly fatigue his respiratory mucles.   Chronic respiratory
   failure from CHF, fluid overload.  PEEP has been weaned to 16 but then
   he eventually becomes hypoxic taking small tidal volumes. Question as
   to whether his shifting his position and allowing his abdomen to
   compress his lungs or decreased PEEP is causing him to take small tidal
   volumes.
   - Bronch today to eval for mucous plugging
   - Attempt to keep him as upright as possible to keep is abdomen from
   compressing his chest
   - will wean PEEP as tolerated, may increase FiO2 if needed to keep PEEP
   down.
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine/BUN to
   improve respiratory status
   - Continue current doses of fentanyl and  versed and increase methadone
   as pt. appears uncomfortable.
   .
   #2  Fever: Spiked through vanc/pip/tazo and continues febrile today.
   Central line pulled yesterday but Pt. may have infected clot at site of
   line. [**Month (only) 60**] need to start considering whole body imaging if continues to
   be febrile.
   - U/S of L subclavian
   - Consider TEE if continues febrile and/or repeat Bcx become positive.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - LFT
s, lipase to eval for intraabdominal source of infection
   - Continue PO vancomycin started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other
   abxs stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-11-20**]
   - Tylenol PRN
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Appears to fluctuate
   significantly, may need to allow Cr to increase in order to wean from
   vent.  Also will need to decrease PEEP to allow better perfusion of his
   renal arteries.
         - Closely follow UOP to decide if higher dose of Lasix is
   necessary
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes while on Lasix drip.
   -          Lasix drip titrate to 130cc/hr UOP may need to increase
   above 10mg/hr.
   -          Check pm lytes
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  CVP 24 but high PEEP contributing.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   ..
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PICC placed by IR.  CVL pulled yesterday.
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities, but unlikely to be accepted on
   Fentanyl and midazolam drips.

","The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in the past. He presents with fluid overload, respiratory failure, and chronic fever secondary to candida auris bacteremia that has not responded to vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam. 

The patient's current medical conditions include acute respiratory decompensation, chronic respiratory failure from congestive heart failure and fluid overload, fever, and acute renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include bronchospasm due to mucous plugging, hypoxia, further worsening of renal function, persistent fever, and potential infections at the site of the central line. 

The treatment plan includes weaning PEEP as tolerated, increasing FiO2 if needed, continuing diuresis to improve respiratory status, increasing methadone for pain management, obtaining imaging studies to identify the source of infection, and closely monitoring renal function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with obesity hypoventilation, chronic heart failure (CHF), and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, desaturation, and requires increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient has a history of allergies to Capoten, cough, and has received antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and obesity hypoventilation put him at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The presence of fever and ongoing cultures suggest a possible infection. Given the patient's immunocompromised state and indwelling lines, there is a risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's chronic diastolic CHF and volume overload increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or cardiogenic shock.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's agitation and inability to follow commands indicate potential neurological complications such as delirium or encephalopathy.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's immobility and critical illness put him at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w fluid overload, respiratory
   failure and chronic fever s/p CONS bacteremia not responsive to
   vancomycin/pip/tazo.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Ongoing, unable to wean from vent b/c of
   intermittent acute decompensation with attempts to wean PEEP, FiO2, and
   to transition to pressure support yesterday.   Acute likely [**1-14**] mucous
   plug (as seen on bronchoscopy on [**11-9**]) with contribution from large
   abdomen causing him to take small tidal volumes and possibly fatigue
   his respiratory mucles.  Also with chronic respiratory failure from
   CHF, fluid overload.  PEEP had been weaned to 14 pre-tracheostomy but
   now he cannot tolerate PEEP lower than approx 20 for any period of time
   b/c he eventually becomes hypoxic taking small tidal volumes.
   Sometimes it seems that when he shifts his position and allows his
   abdomen to compress his lungs he tends to do worse.  Patient with very
   thick mucous/bloody secretions as per respiratory and confirmed on
   bronchoscopy on [**11-9**]).  Also seems to do worse when agitated and has
   been very agitated lately.
   - Aggressive suctioning
   - consider NAC nebulizers (mucomist)
   - Attempt to keep him as upright as possible to keep is abdomen from
   compressing his chest
   - continue to attempt to wean PEEP as tolerated BUT SLOWLY!  [**Month (only) 60**]
   increase FiO2 if needed to keep PEEP down.
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine/BUN to
   improve respiratory status
   - increase methadone dose today as pt. appears uncomfortable.
   .
   #2  Fever: Was afebrile until tracheostomy, has been spiking fevers
   since then (1 week ago) through vanc/pip/tazo and continues to febrile
   today.   Central line pulled two days ago, UE u/s negative for DVT.
   Source of fever still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 5795**] negative, BCx pending, central line
   tip Cx pending. TTE performed but not optimal study. LFTs, lipase wnl.
   - Consider TEE if continues febrile and/or repeat Bcx become positive.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue PO vancomycin started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other
   abxs stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-11-20**]
   - Tylenol PRN
   .
   #3 Agitation: Patient Hx of psychiatric disease (?), agitation at
   baseline. Now with increasing agitation as sedation is weaned (which
   needs to happen for patient to be able to go to rehab).  Was on
   Fentanyl 200 drip and 100 patch 4 days ago and now down to 80 drip with
   no patch.  Have been transitioning from Fentanyl to Methadone
   w/continued agitation, likely due to insufficient replacement with
   methadone.  To some extent agitation is expected as opiates are
   w/drawn, need to balance patient
s agitation with goal to wean off of
   vent.
   - increase standing methadone dose until agitation subsides.
   .
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Fluctuates significantly
   w/diuresis, may need to allow Cr to increase in order to wean from vent
   due to fluid overload.
   -Closely follow UOP to decide if higher dose of Lasix is necessary
   -Continue to follow PM lytes while on Lasix drip.
   - Lasix drip titrate to 130cc/hr UOP may need to increase above
   10mg/hr.
   - Check pm lytes
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  CVP 24 but high PEEP contributing.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed by IR.  A-line not working any more, can pull
   today.
   .
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities, but unlikely to be accepted on
   Fentanyl and midazolam drips.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He presents with fluid overload, respiratory failure, and chronic fever secondary to community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, which has been unresponsive to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is unable to be weaned from the ventilator due to intermittent acute decompensation with attempts to wean PEEP, FiO2, and transition to pressure support. This is likely caused by a large mucous plug in the tracheostomy tube, contributing from his large abdomen compressing his lungs. He also has thick mucous/bloody secretions. The plan is to aggressively suction the airway, consider using N-acetylcysteine nebulizers, keep the patient upright to prevent abdominal compression, slowly wean PEEP as tolerated, and increase FiO2 if needed.

2. Fever: The patient has been febrile since the tracheostomy, with spikes in temperature despite being on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole. Central line-associated bloodstream infection has been ruled out. The source of fever remains unclear, but further evaluation, including TEE, blood cultures"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w fluid overload, respiratory
   failure and chronic fever s/p CONS bacteremia not responsive to
   vancomycin/pip/tazo.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Ongoing, unable to wean from vent b/c of
   intermittent acute decompensation with attempts to wean PEEP, FiO2, and
   to transition to pressure support yesterday.   Acute likely [**1-14**] mucous
   plug (as seen on bronchoscopy on [**11-9**]) with contribution from large
   abdomen causing him to take small tidal volumes and possibly fatigue
   his respiratory mucles.  Also with chronic respiratory failure from
   CHF, fluid overload.  PEEP had been weaned to 14 pre-tracheostomy but
   now he cannot tolerate PEEP lower than approx 20 for any period of time
   b/c he eventually becomes hypoxic taking small tidal volumes.
   Sometimes it seems that when he shifts his position and allows his
   abdomen to compress his lungs he tends to do worse.  Patient with very
   thick mucous/bloody secretions as per respiratory and confirmed on
   bronchoscopy on [**11-9**]).  Also seems to do worse when agitated and has
   been very agitated lately.
   - Aggressive suctioning
   - consider NAC nebulizers (mucomist)
   - Attempt to keep him as upright as possible to keep is abdomen from
   compressing his chest
   - continue to attempt to wean PEEP as tolerated BUT SLOWLY!  [**Month (only) 60**]
   increase FiO2 if needed to keep PEEP down.
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine/BUN to
   improve respiratory status
   - increase methadone dose today as pt. appears uncomfortable.
   .
   #2  Fever: Was afebrile until tracheostomy, has been spiking fevers
   since then (1 week ago) through vanc/pip/tazo and continues to febrile
   today.   Central line pulled two days ago, UE u/s negative for DVT.
   Source of fever still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 5795**] negative, BCx pending, central line
   tip Cx pending. TTE performed but not optimal study. LFTs, lipase wnl.
   - Consider TEE if continues febrile and/or repeat Bcx become positive.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue PO vancomycin started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other
   abxs stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-11-20**]
   - Tylenol PRN
   .
   #3 Agitation: Patient Hx of psychiatric disease (?), agitation at
   baseline. Now with increasing agitation as sedation is weaned (which
   needs to happen for patient to be able to go to rehab).  Was on
   Fentanyl 200 drip and 100 patch 4 days ago and now down to 80 drip with
   no patch.  Have been transitioning from Fentanyl to Methadone
   w/continued agitation, likely due to insufficient replacement with
   methadone.  To some extent agitation is expected as opiates are
   w/drawn, need to balance patient
s agitation with goal to wean off of
   vent.
   -          increase standing methadone dose to 15mg TID (from 10mg TID)
   -          increase Haldol to 5mg TID (from [**Hospital1 **])
   -          increase Klonapin to 1mg QID (from TID)
   -          hold 100 of fentanyl, decrease slowly (20% per day?)
   .
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Fluctuates significantly
   w/diuresis, may need to allow Cr to increase in order to wean from vent
   due to fluid overload.
   -Closely follow UOP to decide if higher dose of Lasix is necessary
   -Continue to follow PM lytes while on Lasix drip.
   - Lasix drip titrate to 130cc/hr UOP may need to increase above
   10mg/hr.
   - Check pm lytes
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  CVP 24 but high PEEP contributing.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He was admitted with fluid overload, respiratory failure, and chronic fever secondary to community-acquired pneumonia not responsive to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and amphotericin B. The patient underwent tracheostomy and bronchoscopy, which revealed a plug of granular tissue/mucous at the end of the tracheostomy and large amounts of mucous/blood occluding the right lower lobe branch of the bronchopulmonary tree. The bronchial washing gram stain showed gram-positive cocci. The patient's condition has been complicated by intermittent acute decompensation with attempts to wean from mechanical ventilation, fever, agitation, acute renal failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, gout, hypervolemic encephalopathy, and potential pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience respiratory failure due to chronic respiratory failure from congestive heart failure, fluid overload, and a large abdomen compressing the lungs. Agitation and inability to clear thick mucous/bloody secretions contribute to the ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Fever: The patient has been febrile since the tracheostomy, despite being on vancomycin, piperacillin-taz"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the ICU with fluid overload, respiratory failure, and chronic fever due to community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia that was not responsive to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, or metronidazole. The patient underwent tracheostomy and bronchoscopy, which revealed a plug of granular tissue/mucus at the end of the tracheostomy tube and a large amount of mucous/blood occluding a right lower lobe branch of the bronchopulmonary tree.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w fluid overload, respiratory
   failure and chronic fever s/p CONS bacteremia not responsive to
   vancomycin/pip/tazo.
   #1 Acute Respiratory Decompensation: Acute likely [**1-14**] mucous plug with
   contribution from large abdomen causing him to take small tidal volumes
   and possibly fatigue his respiratory mucles.   Chronic respiratory
   failure from CHF, fluid overload.  PEEP has been weaned to 16 but then
   he eventually becomes hypoxic taking small tidal volumes. Question as
   to whether his shifting his position and allowing his abdomen to
   compress his lungs or decreased PEEP is causing him to take small tidal
   volumes.
   - Bronch today to eval for mucous plugging
   - Attempt to keep him as upright as possible to keep is abdomen from
   compressing his chest
   - will wean PEEP as tolerated, may increase FiO2 if needed to keep PEEP
   down.
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine/BUN to
   improve respiratory status
   - Continue current doses of fentanyl and  versed and increase methadone
   as pt. appears uncomfortable.
   .
   #2  Fever: Spiked through vanc/pip/tazo and continues febrile today.
   Central line pulled yesterday but Pt. may have infected clot at site of
   line. [**Month (only) 60**] need to start considering whole body imaging if continues to
   be febrile.
   - U/S of L subclavian
   - Consider TEE if continues febrile and/or repeat Bcx become positive.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - LFT
s, lipase to eval for intraabdominal source of infection
   - Continue PO vancomycin started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other
   abxs stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-11-20**]
   - Tylenol PRN
   #3 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Appears to fluctuate
   significantly, may need to allow Cr to increase in order to wean from
   vent.  Also will need to decrease PEEP to allow better perfusion of his
   renal arteries.
         - Closely follow UOP to decide if higher dose of Lasix is
   necessary
   -          Continue to follow PM lytes while on Lasix drip.
   -          Lasix drip titrate to 130cc/hr UOP may need to increase
   above 10mg/hr.
   -          Check pm lytes
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  CVP 24 but high PEEP contributing.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   ..
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   Access: PICC placed by IR.  CVL pulled yesterday.
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities, but unlikely to be accepted on
   Fentanyl and midazolam drips.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a medical history of DMII, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. He is currently in the ICU due to fluid overload, respiratory failure, and chronic fever following a CONS bacteremia that was not responsive to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, or tazobactam. The patient's current issues include acute respiratory decompensation, fever, and acute renal failure. He has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV, and his oxygen saturation has improved to 98% after bronchoscopic evaluation and treatment. However, he remains febrile and continues to have fluctuations in his renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Decompensation: The patient's respiratory status can further deteriorate if there is mucous plugging or inadequate oxygenation due to high abdominal pressure compressing the lungs. Continuous monitoring and bronchoscopy evaluation are necessary to manage this condition effectively.

2. Fever: Despite the removal of the central line, the patient's fever persists, indicating the possibility of an ongoing infection. Whole-body imaging may be considered if the fever continues. The patient's blood, urine, and sputum cultures should be followed closely.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is fluctuating, and it is unclear if this is due to baseline variability or an ongoing issue. Close monitoring of urine"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, heart failure (diastolic), renal failure (acute), pulmonary hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute on chronic, and subsequently developed fever, altered mental status, and a nosebleed. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation support, and recent interventions include bronchoscopy and bronchial washings. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and previous episodes of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and positive gram stain with cocci from bronchial washing suggests a possible infection, which needs to be further evaluated and treated.
3. Bleeding: The patient's nosebleed indicates impaired clotting function, which may be associated with the use of anticoagulants or other underlying bleeding disorders.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has altered electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hypernatremia, which can affect various bodily functions and require careful management.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's acute renal failure requires close monitoring and appropriate management to prevent further deterioration.
6. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient's history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation puts him at risk for cardiac complications"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with respiratory failure, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and prolonged ventilation. The patient has been experiencing agitation, fever, and difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygen saturation levels.

The patient underwent an ultrasound to check for blood clots in the lower extremities, but it was negative. A bronchoscopy was also performed to investigate the cause of right lung collapse, and a specimen was sent for analysis. Additionally, a sputum culture was taken.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 79 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 119/71 mmHg to 138/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Piperacillin, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin), pain management with Fentanyl and Midazolam, diuretic Furosemide, and other medications such as Lipitor, MVI, Labetalol, Zantac, Klonopin, Zaroxolyn, and Haldol.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory symptoms mentioned earlier. The flow sheet data indicates the patient's fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, fluid overload,
   respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for CONS
   bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial, pulmonary edema is probably
   primary but also large abdomen is compressing chest, causing
   respiratory muscle fatigue and failure to wean from PEEP.  Will need to
   frequently reposition to avoid compression of chest by abdomen and low
   tidal volumes.
   - Aggressive suctioning
   - Aggressive repositioning
   - Attempt to keep him as upright as possible to keep is abdomen from
   compressing his chest
   - continue to attempt to wean PEEP 1mm Hg/day
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine/BUN to
   improve respiratory status
   - increase methadone dose today as pt. appears uncomfortable.
   - D/C midazolam, switch clonazepam to diazepam because max dose of
   clonazepam is 6mg/day per pharmacy.
   .
   #2  Fever: Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia. Blood
   cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Many possible infectious sources
   including sinusitis, C. diff, possible PNA, possible IE. Currently does
   not appear septic. Would hold off Abx for now.
   -          Scan in a.m.
   -          D/c acetaminophen
   .
   -          #3 Agitation: Weaning from IV drip sedation to PO/IV bolus
   meds, may need to bolus w/ fentanyl to keep comfortable while weaning
   drips
   -          -D/C midaz today
   .
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Cr improving w/ diuresis
   - Check pm lytes
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  CVP 24 but high PEEP contributing.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed by IR.  A-line pulled yesterday
   .
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities, but unlikely to be accepted on
   Fentanyl and midazolam drips.

","The patient is a 53-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, respiratory failure, persistent fevers post treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), gout, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus (DM), ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a history of cocaine use. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 109/63 to 138/98 mmHg, heart rate between 71-97 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, normal potassium, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, compression of the chest by a large abdomen leading to respiratory muscle fatigue, persistent fevers possibly due to sinusitis, Clostridium difficile infection, possible pneumonia or infective endocarditis, acute renal failure with uncertain baseline, uncontrolled agitation, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation with a CHADS score of 2, and gout.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with DMII, hypertension,
   AF, cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w fluid overload, respiratory
   failure and chronic fever s/p CONS bacteremia not responsive to
   vancomycin/pip/tazo.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Ongoing, unable to wean from vent b/c of
   intermittent acute decompensation with attempts to wean PEEP, FiO2, and
   to transition to pressure support yesterday.   Acute likely [**1-14**] mucous
   plug (as seen on bronchoscopy on [**11-9**]) with contribution from large
   abdomen causing him to take small tidal volumes and possibly fatigue
   his respiratory mucles.  Also with chronic respiratory failure from
   CHF, fluid overload.  PEEP had been weaned to 14 pre-tracheostomy but
   now he cannot tolerate PEEP lower than approx 20 for any period of time
   b/c he eventually becomes hypoxic taking small tidal volumes.
   Sometimes it seems that when he shifts his position and allows his
   abdomen to compress his lungs he tends to do worse.  Patient with very
   thick mucous/bloody secretions as per respiratory and confirmed on
   bronchoscopy on [**11-9**]).  Also seems to do worse when agitated and has
   been very agitated lately.
   - Aggressive suctioning
   - consider NAC nebulizers (mucomist)
   - Attempt to keep him as upright as possible to keep is abdomen from
   compressing his chest
   - continue to attempt to wean PEEP as tolerated BUT SLOWLY!  [**Month (only) 60**]
   increase FiO2 if needed to keep PEEP down.
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine/BUN to
   improve respiratory status
   - increase methadone dose today as pt. appears uncomfortable.
   .
   #2  Fever: Was afebrile until tracheostomy, has been spiking fevers
   since then (1 week ago) through vanc/pip/tazo and continues to febrile
   today.   Central line pulled two days ago, UE u/s negative for DVT.
   Source of fever still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 5795**] negative, BCx pending, central line
   tip Cx pending. TTE performed but not optimal study. LFTs, lipase wnl.
   - Consider TEE if continues febrile and/or repeat Bcx become positive.
   - Continue to follow blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Continue PO vancomycin started [**10-18**] and will end 2 weeks after other
   abxs stopped (stopped on [**11-7**]) which is [**2141-11-20**]
   - Tylenol PRN
   .
   #3 Agitation: Patient Hx of psychiatric disease (?), agitation at
   baseline. Now with increasing agitation as sedation is weaned (which
   needs to happen for patient to be able to go to rehab).  Was on
   Fentanyl 200 drip and 100 patch 4 days ago and now down to 80 drip with
   no patch.  Have been transitioning from Fentanyl to Methadone
   w/continued agitation, likely due to insufficient replacement with
   methadone.  To some extent agitation is expected as opiates are
   w/drawn, need to balance patient
s agitation with goal to wean off of
   vent.
   -          increase standing methadone dose to 15mg TID (from 10mg TID)
   -          increase Haldol to 5mg TID (from [**Hospital1 **])
   -          increase Klonapin to 1mg QID (from TID)
   -          hold 100 of fentanyl, decrease slowly (20% per day?)
   .
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Fluctuates significantly
   w/diuresis, may need to allow Cr to increase in order to wean from vent
   due to fluid overload.
   -Closely follow UOP to decide if higher dose of Lasix is necessary
   -Continue to follow PM lytes while on Lasix drip.
   - Lasix drip titrate to 130cc/hr UOP may need to increase above
   10mg/hr.
   - Check pm lytes
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  CVP 24 but high PEEP contributing.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed by IR.  A-line not working any more, can pull
   today.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently unable to wean from the ventilator due to intermittent acute decompensation with attempts to wean PEEP, FiO2, and transition to pressure support. This suggests ongoing respiratory failure. 

2. Fever: The patient has been spiking fevers since the tracheostomy, which could indicate an ongoing infection. The source of the fever is unclear, but possible causes include a central line infection or pneumonia.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is fluctuating significantly with diuresis, and it is unclear what the baseline renal function is. This may be related to fluid overload and the use of diuretics.

4. Agitation: The patient has a history of psychiatric disease and is experiencing increasing agitation as sedation is weaned. This could be due to insufficient replacement of opiates with methadone.

5. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of prior myocardial infarction and now has positive cocaine on the toxin screen. The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) symptoms are contributing to the respiratory failure.

6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a controlled heart rate. However, the patient is not anticoagulated due to repeat bleeds and Hct drop"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course for persistent ventilatory failure and high PEEP requirements. He has difficulty weaning off sedation due to agitation, a significant history of substance abuse, recurrent fevers, and hypoxemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Altered mental status: The patient requires sedation for safety and to aid in sedation wean off IV medications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic and acute ventilatory failure, persistent hypoxemia, and a requirement for elevated PEEP dosing. There is a need to evaluate the response in terms of compliance and oxygenation, consider recruitment maneuvers if oxygenation is lost on ABG, and re-recruit LLL following trach change.
3. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever with CVL changes and gram stain on bronchoscopy showing GPC's. Culture results are pending, and the patient needs to be on Vancomycin.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has persistent rhythm, and the rate is reasonable.

Additionally, the patient has other medical conditions such as electrolyte and fluid disorders, alteration in nutrition, anxiety, hypernatremia, epistaxis, alteration in elimination related to diarrhea, fever of unknown origin, obesity, nose bleed, H/O acidosis, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic, renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure, chronic (not ARDS), diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure, chronic."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, fluid overload,
   respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for CONS
   bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial, pulmonary edema is probably
   primary but also large abdomen is compressing chest, causing
   respiratory muscle fatigue and failure to wean from PEEP.  Will need to
   frequently reposition to avoid compression of chest by abdomen and low
   tidal volumes.
   - Aggressive suctioning
   - Aggressive repositioning
   - Attempt to keep him as upright as possible to keep is abdomen from
   compressing his chest
   - continue to attempt to wean PEEP 1mm Hg/day
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine/BUN to
   improve respiratory status
   - increase methadone dose today as pt. appears uncomfortable.
   - D/C midazolam, switch clonazepam to diazepam because max dose of
   clonazepam is 6mg/day per pharmacy.
   .
   #2  Fever: Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia. Blood
   cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Many possible infectious sources
   including sinusitis, C. diff, possible PNA, possible IE. Currently does
   not appear septic. Would hold off Abx for now.
   -          Scan in a.m.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, fluid overload,
   respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for CONS
   bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial, pulmonary edema is probably
   primary but also large abdomen is compressing chest, causing
   respiratory muscle fatigue and failure to wean from PEEP.  Will need to
   frequently reposition to avoid compression of chest by abdomen and low
   tidal volumes.
   - Aggressive suctioning
   - Aggressive repositioning
   - Attempt to keep him as upright as possible to keep is abdomen from
   compressing his chest
   - continue to attempt to wean PEEP 1mm Hg/day
   - continue diuresis as tolerated by electrolytes, creatinine/BUN to
   improve respiratory status
   - increase methadone dose today as pt. appears uncomfortable.
   - D/C midazolam, switch clonazepam to diazepam because max dose of
   clonazepam is 6mg/day per pharmacy.
   .
   #2  Fever: Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia. Blood
   cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Many possible infectious sources
   including sinusitis, C. diff, possible PNA, possible IE. Currently does
   not appear septic. Would hold off Abx for now.
   -          Scan in a.m.
   -          D/c acetaminophen
   .
   -          #3 Agitation: Weaning from IV drip sedation to PO/IV bolus
   meds, may need to bolus w/ fentanyl to keep comfortable while weaning
   drips
   -          -D/C midaz today
   .
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Cr improving w/ diuresis
   - Check pm lytes
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: With prior MI, now with +cocaine on toxin
   screen.  CVP 24 but high PEEP contributing.
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding and Hct drop in hospital. CHADS score is 2 (CHF, DM).
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed by IR.  A-line pulled yesterday
   .
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities, but unlikely to be accepted on
   Fentanyl and midazolam drips.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers following treatment for community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus (CONS) bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, fever, agitation, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, gout, and hypervolemic extravascular fluid status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, with pulmonary edema being the primary factor. The large abdomen compressing the chest may also contribute to respiratory muscle fatigue and failure to wean from PEEP. Potential complications include worsening hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Fever: Despite being treated empirically for VAP and CONS bacteremia, the patient's blood cultures have been negative since October 24th. There are multiple possible infectious sources, including sinusitis, Clostridium difficile infection, possible pneumonia, and possible infective endocarditis. The patient does not currently appear septic"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, fluid overload,
   respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for CONS
   bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: improving, weaned PEEP to 19 yesterday and 18
   this am w/ weaning FiO2 from 50->40% Still significant contribution by
   body habitus. Pt. appears much more dry than previously
   -          Continue slow diuresis 500cc/day
   -          Hold lasix drip for now
   -          F/u UOP and if trends toward positive would give lasix bolus
   -          Continue frequent repositioning
   -          Use bolus fentanyl for episodes of agitation
   -          Midazolam weaned yesterday
   .
   #2  Fever: Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia. Blood
   cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Many possible infectious sources
   including sinusitis, C. diff, possible PNA, possible IE. Spiking higher
   since stopping Tylenol.  Currently does not appear septic. Would hold
   off Abx for now. Also possibly could be gout.
   -          Consider Scan today
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from IV drip sedation to PO/IV bolus meds, may
   need to bolus w/ fentanyl to keep comfortable while weaning drips
   -          -- Increase methadone today
   .
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Cr stable w/ diuresis.
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to transfuse because pt. has CAD to keep Hct >25
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding CHADS score is 2
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed by IR.  Consider replace A-line
   .
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities, but unlikely to be accepted on
   Fentanyl and midazolam drips.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers. He has been treated for community-acquired Staphylococcus (CONS) bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's recent events include an episode of atrial fibrillation, agitation, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving, with a reduction in PEEP and FiO2. However, his body habitus remains a significant contributing factor. Diuretics will be continued to manage fluid overload.
2. Fever: The patient's fever was empirically treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia. Blood cultures are negative since October 24th. Possible infectious sources include sinusitis, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), possible pneumonia, or infective endocarditis. A scan may be considered today.
3. Agitation: The patient is being weaned from IV sedation to PO/IV bolus medications. Methadone dosage may need to be increased for comfort during this transition.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is unclear, and the baseline Cr level is stable with diuresis.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type 2 diabetes and is on glargine insulin. Blood sugars were in the normal range yesterday."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with obesity and polysubstance abuse admit with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure with persistent hypoxemia and chronic ventilatory
   support in the setting of tracheostomy has had prolonged ventilatory
   wean.  He has ongoing active issues of fever, C. Diff and need to wean
   PEEP.  Encouragingly patient has had capacity to wean of of IV
   benzodiazepine continuous infusion.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with PSV mode of support in place and has
   maintained good pulmonary compliance in the setting of high PEEP,
   correction of obstruction and continued diruesis with compliance
   currently 40cc/cmH2O.
   -Alb/Atrovent
   -Encouraging findings in regards to diuresis at this time and has had
   pulmonary toilet
   -Wean PEEP today top goal 14 with patient taking reasonable tidal
   volumes and maintaining volume status
   -[**Month (only) 60**] need recruitment from time to time with loss of PEEP to maintain
   open lung units
   2)Acute Renal Failure-Creatinine at 1.7 and has been with reasonable
   diuresis and increasing HCO3-
   -Goal I/O even today
   -Follow up frequently and will use respiratory status to guide need for
   further diuresis
   3)Altered Mental Status-He has a continued issue of agitation and has
   been amenable to re-direction verbally but maintains a significant
   delirium as we are working to diminish multiple sedating medications.
   We do know that patient as baseline is reluctant to actively
   participate in medical care and by report of family and housestaff who
   cared for patient prior to intubation combativeness may be part of
   patient presentation when at baseline.
   -Fentanyl 120ug/hr
   -Haldol 5mg tid
   -Methadone 20mg tid
30mg TID
   -Valium 5-10mg PRN
   -Will need stable dosing of Methadone and Valium to have goal for
   weaning with Haldol supporting background and likely ICU related
   psychosis
   4)Fever--Source not entirely clear and we have a significant concern
   for hospital acquired infection.  The fevers have persisted through
   antibiotics and has had extensive evaluation for sources prior with
   sinusitis, blood stream infection and ventilatory associated pneumonia
   all considered previous infections.  At this time certainly pulmonary
   infection is of concern--however--bronchoscopy without clearly
   significant findings and patient with overall improvement in
   respiratory status.
   -Vanco po
   -Will recheck LFT
s/[**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lipase for recurrent fever
   -Blood cultures negative to date
   -Hemodynamics favorable
   -Possible drug fever and will add diff to evaluate for possible
   alternative sources of fever
   5)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Stable HR
   -Continued A-Fib
   Additional issues to be managed as described in the housestaff note of
   this date and are summarized below.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of obesity and polysubstance abuse. 

The patient has been admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and persistent hypoxemia. They require chronic ventilatory support through a tracheostomy and have had a prolonged ventilatory wean. 

The patient is currently experiencing a fever, and there is concern for hospital-acquired infection. The patient also has chronic ventilatory support with PSV mode, and the goal is to wean PEEP today with a target of 14. 

The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.7. The goal is to maintain even I/O today and follow up frequently while using respiratory status to guide further diuresis.

The patient also has altered mental status, characterized by agitation and significant delirium. The plan is to diminish multiple sedating medications and use Haldol to support background and likely ICU-related psychosis. 

Other issues include atrial fibrillation, which is stable with a continued A-Fib. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to the patient's ongoing need for ventilatory support.
2. Hospital-acquired infection, as indicated by the recurrent fever despite antibiotics and extensive evaluation.
3. Delirium or altered mental status, which may be exacerbated by the use of multiple sedating medications.
4. Acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine"

The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been experiencing spikes in temperature for unclear reasons. He is currently agitated and has been given midazolam (Versed) and diazepam (Valium) for sedation. The patient's PEEP remains elevated in an attempt to decrease it by 1 cmH2O per day. His HCT is stable. 

Allergies include Capoten (Captopril), which causes cough. The last dose of antibiotics administered was vancomycin on [date]. The patient is receiving various infusions and other ICU medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including tmax of 39.2°C (102.6°F), tcurrent of 38.6°C (101.4°F), HR of 78 bpm, BP of 120/81 mmHg, RR of 9 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF). 

The patient has received a total of 1,834 mL of fluids, with an output of 2,245 mL, including 840 mL of TF, 309 mL of IVF, and 590 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output is also 2,245 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, fluid overload,
   respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for CONS
   bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: improving, weaned PEEP to 19 yesterday and 18
   this am w/ weaning FiO2 from 50->40% Still significant contribution by
   body habitus. Pt. appears much more dry than previously
   -          Continue slow diuresis 500cc/day
   -          Hold lasix drip for now
   -          F/u UOP and if trends toward positive would give lasix bolus
   -          Continue frequent repositioning
   -          Use bolus fentanyl for episodes of agitation
   -          Midazolam weaned yesterday
   .
   #2  Fever: Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia. Blood
   cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Many possible infectious sources
   including sinusitis, C. diff, possible PNA, possible IE. Spiking higher
   since stopping Tylenol.  Currently does not appear septic. Would hold
   off Abx for now. Also possibly could be gout.
   -          Consider Scan today
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from IV drip sedation to PO/IV bolus meds, may
   need to bolus w/ fentanyl to keep comfortable while weaning drips
   -          -- Increase methadone today
   .
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Cr stable w/ diuresis.
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine. Blood sugars in normal range
   yesterday.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to transfuse because pt. has CAD to keep Hct >25
   - Tolerating labetalol
   - Cont. to hold on [**Last Name (un) 239**] until patient more euvolemic
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding CHADS score is 2
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic extravascularly, continue diuresis as able; replete
   PRN, DM TF until patient cleared by speech/swallow; consider
   post-pyloric tube placement by IR.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed by IR.  Consider replace A-line
   .
   Dispo:  screen for rehab facilities, but unlikely to be accepted on
   Fentanyl and midazolam drips.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers. He was treated for community-acquired Staphylococcus (CONS) bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's fever is still present despite treatment, and blood cultures have been negative since October 24th. He has been empirically treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia. The patient is agitated and requires sedation, and his renal function is stable with diuresis. He has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), gout, and a previous myocardial infarction (MI). The patient is currently receiving various medications including diuretics, antibiotics, sedatives, and analgesics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been improving, with a decrease in PEEP and FiO2 levels. However, he still has significant contributions from his body habitus, which may hinder weaning off ventilatory support.
2. Fever: The patient's fever persists despite treatment for VAP and CONS bacteremia. Possible infectious sources include sinusitis, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), possible pneumonia (PNA), and possible infective endocarditis (IE). It is important to consider these possibilities and conduct appropriate investigations.
3. Agitation: The patient is agitated and requires sedation. Weaning from IV sedation to PO/IV bolus medications should be considered, with the use of fentanyl to manage episodes of discomfort or agitation.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is stable with diuresis, but the baseline renal function is unclear. Close monitoring of renal parameters is essential.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has DM, and his blood sugars were in the normal range yesterday. Continuing the current insulin regimen is recommended.
6. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and a previous MI. It is important to monitor his cardiac status and consider appropriate interventions.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has AF, which is well-controlled with medication. However, he is not anticoagulated due to bleeding complications, and rate control should be maintained.
8. Gout: The patient has gout, and allopurinol should be continued to manage this condition.
9. Access: The patient has a PICC line placed, and consideration should be given to replacing the arterial line.
10. Disposition: The patient's disposition should be discussed, considering his current medical condition and suitability for rehabilitation facilities."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Patient appears to be slowly improving in his
   respiratory status, although a barrier to continued wean from MV is
   agitation when sedation is decreased. Today PEEP 17 at 40% FIO2 which
   is much improved, and will continue in this fashion. Not likely to be
   due to fluid overload even though he is still somewhat fluid overloaded
   peripherally.
   -          Wean fentanyl as tolerated
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP
   -          d/c haldol, use seroquel tid instead
   -          continue versed for now, use boluses for agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   .
   #2  Fever: Unclear etiology of fevers- ? medications vs. infectious
   cause. Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia. Blood
   cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Currently does not appear septic and
   respiratory status is improving which speaks against pulmonary
   infection.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be due to haldol as that was recently started
   since fevers have been coming on. Will stop haldol and continue to
   monitor fevers. Hold off on antibiotics for now until we know what we
   are treating.
   -f/u blood culture
   -f/u sputum culture- we called lab and asked for them to do it even if
   it is oropharyngeal flora, it was a tracheal sample
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from sedation yesterday caused significant
   agitation. With changes in meds as above will attempt to slowly back
   off instead of completely removing sedation. Hold methadone as is.
   .
   -use versed bolus prn agitation
   -slowly wean sedation
   -avoid haldol
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Unclear baseline.  Cr stable.
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Will consider
   changing labetalol to carvediolol tomorrow, and add diovan back on.
   Currently hemodynamically stable.
   - cont labetalol
   - diovan 80mg qd po
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding CHADS score is 2
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers. He has been treated for community-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been sedated. He has been experiencing agitation when sedation is decreased. His respiratory status has improved, but he still shows signs of fluid overload. He has an atrial fibrillation rhythm, which is rate-controlled, and he is not anticoagulated. The patient also has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, gout, and acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is slowly improving, but there is a barrier to continued weaning from mechanical ventilation due to agitation when sedation is decreased. PEEP is being gradually decreased, and the patient's condition should be closely monitored.
2. Fever: The etiology of the patient's fevers is unclear, with possible causes including medications or an infectious cause. The patient has been empirically treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infection, but blood cultures have been negative since October 24th. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fevers.
3. Agitation: Weaning from sedation has caused significant agitation in the patient. Medication adjustments have been made to manage this issue, including switching from haloperidol"

   prominent role in difficulty weaning.
   On zaroxolyn only currently and staying slightly negative.
   Agitation:  Will continue narcotics at current dose.  Will add seroquel
   and stop haldol as it has not worked and continue to try and wean
   versed, while supplementing with IV versed
   for agitation (bolus only).
   Fever:  Unclear cause, stoping Haldol in case this is drug fever.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with respiratory failure who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period. The patient has been receiving continuous sedation, and an attempt has been made to wean the sedation. 

The patient developed a fever of 102.6°F on [**2141-11-12**] at 03:00 PM, along with an increase in medication doses to attempt weaning of continuous sedation. Blood and sputum cultures were obtained on the same day.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F), current temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/68 mmHg to 137/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, using CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 702 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 32 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 17 cmH2O, and fractional concentration of oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system is clear.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, platelet count of 173 K/uL, serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level ranging from 84 to 138 mg/dL, sodium level of 138 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, and chloride level of 102 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and unresponsive neurologically.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.

2. Drug fever: The patient's fever could be due to a drug reaction or drug fever, especially considering the recent changes in medication.

3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an underlying infection.

4. Weaning difficulties: The patient's agitation and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation indicate potential complications related to sedation and agitation management.

5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, suggesting fluid overload, which may contribute to respiratory distress.

6. Organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, platelet count, and renal function, indicating possible organ dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and renal failure. He is currently on several medications and is being supported by mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate, and decreased blood pressure. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The low oxygen saturation and elevated respiratory rate indicate inadequate gas exchange. Continued monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation are necessary.

2. Septic Shock: The presence of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension may suggest an infection leading to septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt administration of antibiotics are crucial.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient has a history of type II diabetes, there is no information provided regarding his blood glucose levels. DKA can occur in patients with diabetes when they are stressed or have an infection. Monitoring blood glucose levels and electrolyte imbalances is essential.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and the lab results show elevated creatinine levels. AKI can worsen the patient's existing renal function, leading to fluid and electrolyte"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Initially treated for VAP, slowly improving
   with decreasing PEEP. Patient did well today on PS at PEEP 14 and FIO2
   40% for quite some time but became agitated, dropped his tidal volume
   and became somewhat apneic. These episodes only occur during agitation
   at this point, and improved with versed bolus and FIO2 to 50%. We will
   continue to wean his PEEP. Per respiratory very little secretions.  On
   admission the patient was actively diuresed so it is unlikely that
   pulmonary edema is a problem at this point. PNA is also unlikely
   however he is still spiking fevers of unknown etiology (see below).
   Will repeat a CXR today as tube seems to be out 1cm and needs to be
   readjusted. Also he is currently off sedation and we are hoping to
   continue to wean sedative medications
   -          Wean fentanyl, versed as tolerated
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP
   -          Adjust tube to 9cm, repeat CXR to verify and check for new
   consolidations
   -          versed prn for agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   .
   #2  Fever: Still unclear etiology of fevers- ? medications vs.
   infectious cause. This has been going on since admission and continues
   despite antibiotic treatment. Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS
   bacteremia. Blood cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Currently does not
   appear septic and respiratory status is improving which speaks against
   pulmonary infection, trach sample sputum culture still pending.  Last
   urine culture was negative. Sputum cultures from  Haldol was stopped
   yesterday but fevers continued. Also noted on labs was eosinophilia
   which may be incidental or due to drug fever.
   -f/u blood culture
   -f/u sputum culture
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from sedation is proving difficult. He did well
   for most of today but became agitated when sedation was taken off
   completely. We will increase seroquel to 100 [**Hospital1 **] in hopes this will
   help with agitation and decrease need for versed. Will continue to wean
   sedation, as this is a barried to extubation as well as placement in
   rehab.
   .
   -use versed bolus prn agitation
   -slowly wean sedation again
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Baseline is ?1.5-1.8 per admission notes.  Cr
   has been stable for several days. Likely Cr increase was secondary to
   aggressive diuresis. He has had good urine output on zaroxylin, which
   will be d/c to given hypernatremia and fluid deficit. Also will
   resuscitate slowly with D5
 NS 1L and monitor for improvement in Cr.
   -d/c zaroxylin
   -1L D5 1/2NS
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Currently
   hemodynamically stable on this regimen so will not change.
   - cont labetalol
   - diovan 80mg qd po
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding CHADS score is 2
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: tube feeds with free water boluses, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed (L arm)
   .
   Dispo:  continue to wean off sedation and screen for rehabilitation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers post treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia, but blood cultures have been negative since October 24th. He is currently off sedation and being weaned from mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he continues to have episodes of agitation and apnea. His fever of unknown origin persists despite antibiotic treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if he experiences repeated episodes of agitation and apnea, leading to inadequate ventilation.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fevers could indicate an ongoing infection or a drug-related fever. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation may pose a barrier to extubation and placement in rehabilitation. It needs to be managed effectively to ensure his safety and comfort.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there is a possibility of acute renal failure due to aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of ischemic"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Patient appears to be slowly improving in his
   respiratory status, although a barrier to continued wean from MV is
   agitation when sedation is decreased. Today PEEP 17 at 40% FIO2 which
   is much improved, and will continue in this fashion. Not likely to be
   due to fluid overload even though he is still somewhat fluid overloaded
   peripherally.
   -          Wean fentanyl as tolerated

   #2  Fever: Unclear etiology of fevers- ? medications vs. infectious
   cause. Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS bacteremia. Blood
   cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Currently does not appear septic and
   respiratory status is improving which speaks against pulmonary
   infection.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be due to haldol as that was recently started
   since fevers have been coming on. Will stop haldol and continue to
   monitor fevers. Hold off on antibiotics for now until we know what we
   are treating.
   -f/u blood culture
   -f/u sputum culture- we called lab and asked for them to do it even if
   it is oropharyngeal flora, it was a tracheal sample
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from sedation yesterday caused significant
   agitation. With changes in meds as above will attempt to slowly back
   off instead of completely removing sedation. Hold methadone as is.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers post treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to be slowly improving in his respiratory status. However, agitation when sedation is decreased remains a barrier to continued weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV). The patient's PEEP has been weaned to 16 cmH2O and is being ventilated with 40% FiO2. This suggests that the respiratory status is improving.

Potential complications that can arise include:
- Continued respiratory failure if the patient does not continue to improve.
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
- Barotrauma or bronchospasm if excessive PEEP is applied.

2. Fever: The etiology of the fevers is unclear, with possible causes including medications or an infectious source. The patient was empirically treated for VAP and CAP, but blood cultures have been negative since October 24th. The recent start of haloperidol may also contribute to the fevers, so it will be discontinued.

Potential complications that can arise include:
- Continued fever if the underlying cause is not identified and treated"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and prolonged respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions, including respiratory failure, fever, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, agitation, hypernatremia, and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. He is receiving multiple medications and has various tubes and lines in place for nutrition, hydration, and medication administration. The patient's neurological status is described as poor, with no follow commands or response to noxious stimuli. The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and potassium levels, while other labs are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and increased wheezing may suggest an infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. The patient's elevated troponin levels may indicate possible cardiac involvement.
3. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and poor neurological status may be due to sedative medications or underlying infections.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Initially treated for VAP, slowly improving
   with decreasing PEEP. Yesterday Pt having diffuclty at PEEP 14 and
   becoming agitated, desating.  We will continue to attempt to  wean his
   PEEP. Per respiratory very little secretions.  On admission the patient
   was actively diuresed so it is unlikely that pulmonary edema is a
   problem at this point. Consistantly febrile since [**11-13**], new
   retrocardiac opacities, new WBC and decreasing BP concerning for new
   PNA. Wean fentanyl, versed as tolerated, d/c gtt and now on bolus.
   Yesterday had severe mucos plugging with desat to low 70s improved
   after deep suction and [**Last Name (un) 1340**].
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP
   -          Versed and fentanyl prn for agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   -          Given mucous plugging and retrocardiac opacity to repeat
   bronch for good sputum sample and further mucus removal.
   .
   #2  Fever: Still long course of fevers with had no recent clear source
   recently thought to be [**1-14**] medications. Was empirically treated for VAP
   and CONS bacteremia. Blood cultures negative since [**10-24**].  New increase
   in fever temp over last 24 hrs, drop in BP and UO, new retrocardiac
   opacity, concerning for PNA, sepsis physiology. Last urine culture was
   negative 11.29.  Sputum cultures to be collected today.  Haldol was
   [**11-13**]  but fevers continued. Also noted on labs was eosinophilia which
   may be incidental or due to drug fever.
   -f/u blood culture
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   - added IV vanco 1g q24h and Doripenem 250mg q8h to cover VAP
   -new blood and sputum cultures 12/3
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from sedation is proving difficult. Improved with
   increase seroquel to 100 Tid in hopes this will help with agitation and
   decrease need for versed. Will continue to wean sedation, as this is a
   barried to extubation as well as placement in rehab.
   -use versed and fentanyl bolus prn agitation
   -slowly wean sedation again
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Baseline is ?1.5-1.8 per admission notes.  Cr
   has been stable for several days. Likely Cr increase was secondary to
   aggressive diuresis. He has had good urine output on zaroxylin, which
   will be d/c to given hypernatremia and fluid deficit. Also will
   resuscitate slowly with D5
 NS 1L and monitor for improvement in Cr.

The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers following treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He was admitted with severe sepsis secondary to CAP and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He underwent bronchoscopy to remove a large blood clot and thick sputum.

On the current date, the patient's temperature is 103.0°F, blood pressure is 103/61 mmHg, heart rate is 81 bpm, respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on the ventilator. The patient has atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular rate. He is febrile, has a decreased blood pressure, and shows new retrocardiac opacities on chest X-ray, indicating possible new pneumonia (PNA).

The patient has been experiencing difficulty weaning off sedation due to agitation. His white blood cell count is elevated, and he has eosinophilia. He also has acute renal failure with stable creatinine levels, possibly secondary to aggressive diuresis. His blood glucose levels have been within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Initially treated for VAP, slowly improving
   with decreasing PEEP. Patient did well today on PS at PEEP 14 and FIO2
   40% for quite some time but became agitated, dropped his tidal volume
   and became somewhat apneic. These episodes only occur during agitation
   at this point, and improved with versed bolus and FIO2 to 50%. We will
   continue to wean his PEEP. Per respiratory very little secretions.  On
   admission the patient was actively diuresed so it is unlikely that
   pulmonary edema is a problem at this point. PNA is also unlikely
   however he is still spiking fevers of unknown etiology (see below).
   Will repeat a CXR today as tube seems to be out 1cm and needs to be
   readjusted. Also he is currently off sedation and we are hoping to
   continue to wean sedative medications
   -          Wean fentanyl, versed as tolerated
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP
   -          Adjust tube to 9cm, repeat CXR to verify and check for new
   consolidations
   -          versed prn for agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   .
   #2  Fever: Still unclear etiology of fevers- ? medications vs.
   infectious cause. This has been going on since admission and continues
   despite antibiotic treatment. Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS
   bacteremia. Blood cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Currently does not
   appear septic and respiratory status is improving which speaks against
   pulmonary infection, trach sample sputum culture still pending.  Last
   urine culture was negative. Sputum cultures from  Haldol was stopped
   yesterday but fevers continued. Also noted on labs was eosinophilia
   which may be incidental or due to drug fever.
   -f/u blood culture
   -f/u sputum culture
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from sedation is proving difficult. He did well
   for most of today but became agitated when sedation was taken off
   completely. We will increase seroquel to 100 [**Hospital1 **] in hopes this will
   help with agitation and decrease need for versed. Will continue to wean
   sedation, as this is a barried to extubation as well as placement in
   rehab.
   .
   -use versed bolus prn agitation
   -slowly wean sedation again
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Baseline is ?1.5-1.8 per admission notes.  Cr
   has been stable for several days. Likely Cr increase was secondary to
   aggressive diuresis. He has had good urine output on zaroxylin, which
   will be d/c to given hypernatremia and fluid deficit. Also will
   resuscitate slowly with D5

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Initially treated for VAP, slowly improving
   with decreasing PEEP. Patient did well today on PS at PEEP 14 and FIO2
   40% for quite some time but became agitated, dropped his tidal volume
   and became somewhat apneic. These episodes only occur during agitation
   at this point, and improved with versed bolus and FIO2 to 50%. We will
   continue to wean his PEEP. Per respiratory very little secretions.  On
   admission the patient was actively diuresed so it is unlikely that
   pulmonary edema is a problem at this point. PNA is also unlikely
   however he is still spiking fevers of unknown etiology (see below).
   Will repeat a CXR today as tube seems to be out 1cm and needs to be
   readjusted. Also he is currently off sedation and we are hoping to
   continue to wean sedative medications
   -          Wean fentanyl, versed as tolerated
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP
   -          Adjust tube to 9cm, repeat CXR to verify and check for new
   consolidations
   -          versed prn for agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   .
   #2  Fever: Still unclear etiology of fevers- ? medications vs.
   infectious cause. This has been going on since admission and continues
   despite antibiotic treatment. Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS
   bacteremia. Blood cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Currently does not
   appear septic and respiratory status is improving which speaks against
   pulmonary infection, trach sample sputum culture still pending.  Last
   urine culture was negative. Sputum cultures from  Haldol was stopped
   yesterday but fevers continued. Also noted on labs was eosinophilia
   which may be incidental or due to drug fever.
   -f/u blood culture
   -f/u sputum culture
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from sedation is proving difficult. He did well
   for most of today but became agitated when sedation was taken off
   completely. We will increase seroquel to 100 [**Hospital1 **] in hopes this will
   help with agitation and decrease need for versed. Will continue to wean
   sedation, as this is a barried to extubation as well as placement in
   rehab.
   .
   -use versed bolus prn agitation
   -slowly wean sedation again
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Baseline is ?1.5-1.8 per admission notes.  Cr
   has been stable for several days. Likely Cr increase was secondary to
   aggressive diuresis. He has had good urine output on zaroxylin, which
   will be d/c to given hypernatremia and fluid deficit. Also will
   resuscitate slowly with D5
 NS 1L and monitor for improvement in Cr.
   -d/c zaroxylin
   -1L D5 1/2NS
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Currently
   hemodynamically stable on this regimen so will not change.
   - cont labetalol
   - diovan 80mg qd po
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding CHADS score is 2
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: tube feeds with free water boluses, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers post treatment for community-acquired nosocomial (CONS) bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and received bronchoscopy, during which a large blood clot and thick sputum were removed. He has been on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has had various issues with agitation, apnea, and fever. 

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications: 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had VAP, but his respiratory status is slowly improving. He is being weaned off sedation and PEEP, and his secretions are minimal. However, he still experiences episodes of agitation, which can lead to apnea. 

2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers of unknown etiology since admission. Despite antibiotic treatment, the fevers continue. Blood cultures were negative, and respiratory status improvement suggests that a pulmonary infection is less likely. The eosinophilia may indicate an allergic reaction or drug fever. 

3. Agitation: Weaning from sedation is difficult for the patient, and he becomes agitated when sedation is completely stopped. This agitation can be managed with versed boluses and increasing the"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Initially treated for VAP, slowly improving
   with decreasing PEEP. Yesterday Pt having diffuclty at PEEP 14 and
   becoming agitated, desating.  We will continue to attempt to  wean his
   PEEP. Per respiratory very little secretions.  On admission the patient
   was actively diuresed so it is unlikely that pulmonary edema is a
   problem at this point. Consistantly febrile since [**11-13**], new
   retrocardiac opacities, new WBC and decreasing BP concerning for new
   PNA. Wean fentanyl, versed as tolerated, d/c gtt and now on bolus.
   Yesterday had severe mucos plugging with desat to low 70s improved
   after deep suction and [**Last Name (un) 1340**].
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP
   -          Versed and fentanyl prn for agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   -          Given mucous plugging and retrocardiac opacity to repeat
   bronch for good sputum sample and further mucus removal.
   .
   #2  Fever: Still long course of fevers with had no recent clear source
   recently thought to be [**1-14**] medications. Was empirically treated for VAP
   and CONS bacteremia. Blood cultures negative since [**10-24**].  New increase
   in fever temp over last 24 hrs, drop in BP and UO, new retrocardiac
   opacity, concerning for PNA, sepsis physiology. Last urine culture was
   negative 11.29.  Sputum cultures to be collected today.  Haldol was
   [**11-13**]  but fevers continued. Also noted on labs was eosinophilia which
   may be incidental or due to drug fever.
   -f/u blood culture
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   - added IV vanco 1g q24h and Doripenem 250mg q8h to cover VAP
   -new blood and sputum cultures 12/3
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from sedation is proving difficult. Improved with
   increase seroquel to 100 Tid in hopes this will help with agitation and
   decrease need for versed. Will continue to wean sedation, as this is a
   barried to extubation as well as placement in rehab.
   -use versed and fentanyl bolus prn agitation
   -slowly wean sedation again
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Baseline is ?1.5-1.8 per admission notes.  Cr
   now uptrending. Likely Cr increase was secondary to aggressive
   diuresis. He has had good urine output on zaroxylin, which was d/c [**1-14**]
    hypernatremia and fluid deficit. . Recent Cr increase dispite fluid
   repleation with D5 1/2NS. Drop in BP suggestive of sepsis and prerenal
   etiology
   -off zaroxylin
   -1L NS bolus
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Currently
   hemodynamically stable on this regimen so will not change.
   - cont labetalol
   - d/c diovan given hypotension, worsening Cr.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding CHADS score is 2
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: tube feeds with free water boluses, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers post treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has been experiencing difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, with recent episodes of agitation and desaturation.
- There are new retrocardiac opacities on chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia.
- The patient has been febrile since November 13th and has shown no clear source of infection.
- Blood cultures have been negative since October 24th.
- The patient's blood pressure and urine output have decreased, suggesting sepsis and possible acute kidney injury.
- The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has increased, which may indicate a new infection.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics for VAP, diuretics, insulin for diabetes, antihypertensives, and medications for agitation and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation and recent episodes of agitation and desaturation may indicate ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The new retrocardiac opacities on chest X-ray and the patient's persistent fevers suggest the possibility of pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Initially treated for VAP, slowly improving
   with decreasing PEEP. Patient did well today on PS at PEEP 14 and FIO2
   40% for quite some time but became agitated, dropped his tidal volume
   and became somewhat apneic. These episodes only occur during agitation
   at this point, and improved with versed bolus and FIO2 to 50%. We will
   continue to wean his PEEP. Per respiratory very little secretions.  On
   admission the patient was actively diuresed so it is unlikely that
   pulmonary edema is a problem at this point. PNA is also unlikely
   however he is still spiking fevers of unknown etiology (see below).
   Will repeat a CXR today as tube seems to be out 1cm and needs to be
   readjusted. Also he is currently off sedation and we are hoping to
   continue to wean sedative medications
   -          Wean fentanyl, versed as tolerated
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP
   -          Adjust tube to 9cm, repeat CXR to verify and check for new
   consolidations
   -          versed prn for agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   .
   #2  Fever: Still unclear etiology of fevers- ? medications vs.
   infectious cause. This has been going on since admission and continues
   despite antibiotic treatment. Was empirically treated for VAP and CONS
   bacteremia. Blood cultures negative since [**10-24**]. Currently does not
   appear septic and respiratory status is improving which speaks against
   pulmonary infection, trach sample sputum culture still pending.  Last
   urine culture was negative. Sputum cultures from  Haldol was stopped
   yesterday but fevers continued. Also noted on labs was eosinophilia
   which may be incidental or due to drug fever.
   -f/u blood culture
   -f/u sputum culture
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from sedation is proving difficult. He did well
   for most of today but became agitated when sedation was taken off
   completely. We will increase seroquel to 100 [**Hospital1 **] in hopes this will
   help with agitation and decrease need for versed. Will continue to wean
   sedation, as this is a barried to extubation as well as placement in
   rehab.
   .
   -use versed bolus prn agitation
   -slowly wean sedation again
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Baseline is ?1.5-1.8 per admission notes.  Cr
   has been stable for several days. Likely Cr increase was secondary to
   aggressive diuresis. He has had good urine output on zaroxylin, which
   will be d/c to given hypernatremia and fluid deficit. Also will
   resuscitate slowly with D5
 NS 1L and monitor for improvement in Cr.
   -d/c zaroxylin
   -1L D5 1/2NS
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP

   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers post treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been aggressively diuresed, which has resulted in a decrease in pulmonary edema. His respiratory status is slowly improving, with decreasing PEEP and FiO2. However, he continues to experience agitation and has shown episodes of apnea during sedation weaning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying conditions and the ongoing weaning process from mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary.
2. Fever of Unknown Etiology: Despite treatment for VAP and bacteremia, the patient's fevers persist. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fevers, which could potentially be due to medication reactions or an infectious process.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation may complicate extubation and placement in a rehabilitation program. Adjustments to his sedation regimen and the use of antipsychotic medications may be necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there has been a recent increase in his serum creatinine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status. The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2141-11-14**] at 04:00 PM, during which a huge blood clot and thick sputum were removed. The patient also has a fever of 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, and there is a concern for acute respiratory failure due to the presence of a mucus plug on the left upper lobe, which improved with suction. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 30 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 60%. The ABG results show metabolic alkalosis (pH: 7.34), indicating respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has altered mental status and electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia (low potassium) and hypotassium (low sodium). The fluid balance shows a positive net fluid intake of"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Initially treated for VAP, slowly improving
   with decreasing PEEP. Yesterday Pt having diffuclty at PEEP 14 and
   becoming agitated, desating.  We will continue to attempt to  wean his
   PEEP. Per respiratory very little secretions.  On admission the patient
   was actively diuresed so it is unlikely that pulmonary edema is a
   problem at this point. Consistantly febrile since [**11-13**], new
   retrocardiac opacities, new WBC and decreasing BP concerning for new
   PNA. Wean fentanyl, versed as tolerated, d/c gtt and now on bolus.
   Yesterday had severe mucos plugging with desat to low 70s improved
   after deep suction and [**Last Name (un) 1340**].
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP
   -          Versed and fentanyl prn for agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   -          Given mucous plugging and retrocardiac opacity to repeat
   bronch for good sputum sample and further mucus removal.
   .
   #2  Fever: Still long course of fevers with had no recent clear source
   recently thought to be [**1-14**] medications. Was empirically treated for VAP
   and CONS bacteremia. Blood cultures negative since [**10-24**].  New increase
   in fever temp over last 24 hrs, drop in BP and UO, new retrocardiac
   opacity, concerning for PNA, sepsis physiology. Last urine culture was
   negative 11.29.  Sputum cultures to be collected today.  Haldol was
   [**11-13**]  but fevers continued. Also noted on labs was eosinophilia which
   may be incidental or due to drug fever.
   -f/u blood culture
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   - added IV vanco 1g q24h and Doripenem 250mg q8h to cover VAP
   -new blood and sputum cultures 12/3
   .
   #3 Agitation: Weaning from sedation is proving difficult. Improved with
   increase seroquel to 100 Tid in hopes this will help with agitation and
   decrease need for versed. Will continue to wean sedation, as this is a
   barried to extubation as well as placement in rehab.
   -use versed and fentanyl bolus prn agitation
   -slowly wean sedation again
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Baseline is ?1.5-1.8 per admission notes.  Cr
   now uptrending. Likely Cr increase was secondary to aggressive
   diuresis. He has had good urine output on zaroxylin, which was d/c [**1-14**]
   hypernatremia and fluid deficit. . Recent Cr increase dispite fluid
   repleation with D5 1/2NS. Drop in BP suggestive of sepsis and prerenal
   etiology
   -off zaroxylin
   -1L NS bolus
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Currently
   hemodynamically stable on this regimen so will not change.
   - cont labetalol
   - d/c diovan given hypotension, worsening Cr.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Not anticoagulated [**1-14**]
   bleeding CHADS score is 2
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   - Labetolol for rate control
   .
   # Gout: Stable, continue Allopurinol
   .
   FEN: tube feeds with free water boluses, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed (L arm)
   .
   Dispo:  continue to wean off sedation and screen for rehabilitation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall adult with unknown weight, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fever since November 13th and was started on vancomycin and doripenem for suspected pneumonia (PNA). The patient also has an odd urine sediment this morning, and a Foley catheter was changed with a urine culture sent. 

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 102.7°F (39.3°C), current temperature of 102.1°F (38.9°C), heart rate ranging from 78 to 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 69/50 mmHg to 115/69 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 13 to 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient is agitated and in pain, requiring conversion to fentanyl and versed bolus, now back on versed gtt.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 5,574 mL and output of 782 mL, with urine output being 225 mL. The patient's blood cultures were drawn on November 15th and 16th, as well as urine and BAL cultures. The patient's WBC count has increased, SBP is trending down, and UO is decreased. 

The patient's labs indicate a WBC count of 13"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Treated in the earlier on this admission for
   VAP now new concern for PNA given post-bronch CXR still looks like he
   has consolidations(?retrocardiac opacity), also with continuous fevers
   and leukocytosis. In the setting of slowly dropping mean BPs he could
   very well be in sepsis, however it is not certain that the source is
   pulmonary. Saturations have been good today and but is difficult to
   wean off vent. No further issues at this time with mucus plugging.
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP as tolerated
   -          Versed drip, bolus prn agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   -          f/u BAL, cultures
   -          on IV vanco and doripenem for ?sepsis
   .
   #2  Fever: As above fevers with no clear source. Today
s UA is
   indicative of bacterial infection which is covered by doripenem.  Will
   follow up on blood and urine cultures, as well as pending sputum
   culture and BAL. Other thoughts include gout (patient has been
   receiving allopurinol but has been fluid down since admission and
   losing hydration via long-term vent and fevers) and given his tender
   knee on exam this could be the source of fever. Also to consider is
   meningitis however no reason to suspect this, he does not show signs of
   meningismus and mental status has been stable for some time. Continue
   antibiotics for now but once source is identify would narrow down
   coverage to decrease likelihood of causing resistance.
   -f/u blood culture
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   - added IV vanco 1g q24h and Doripenem 250mg q8h
   -tap knee and consult rheum if necessary
   -new blood and sputum cultures 12/3
   .
   #3 Agitation: Having difficulty weaning from sedation. Per pharmacy
   recs will change methadone to 20mg tid dosing in hopes of keeping a
   steady opioid level during the day will help with weaning of sedation
   drip.
   -use versed bolus prn agitation, attempt to wean off drip
   -methadone 20mg tid po
   -seroquel
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Creatinine has been slowly increasing over
   several days which is also likely pre-renal dehydration. Will renally
   dose his medications, including allopurinol today. Otherwise there is
   no reason to suspect intrinsic renal disease. Zaroxylin and lasix have
   been stopped, and fluid boluses were initiated both for rising Cr and
   hypotensive episodes. This is again concerning for sepsis.
   -renally dose medications
   -1L NS bolus prn
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Several episodes
   of hypotension so labetalol and diovan will be held for now.
   - hold labetalol for hypotension
   - d/c diovan given hypotension
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Meds held as above. Will
   monitor telemetry closely
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   .
   # Gout: Could potentially be the cause of his knee pain especially in
   the setting of dehydration and infection. Will tap knee today and send
   off cell count/cytology and cultures. ? Rheum consult.
   -f/u tap sample labs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, chronic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and worsening respiratory failure despite treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and there is a concern for possible pneumonia. He is on mechanical ventilation, and weaning off the ventilator is difficult.
2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing continuous fevers, which could be indicative of an ongoing infection. The urine analysis shows signs of bacterial infection, and cultures have been sent to identify the causative organism.
3. Agitation: The patient is having difficulty being weaned off sedation, and agitation is present. Pharmacological interventions are being considered to help manage the agitation.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been slowly increasing, suggesting acute renal failure. This may be due to pre-renal dehydration and sepsis.
5. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous myocardial infarction (MI) related to cocaine use. There have been episodes of hypotension, so antihypertensive medications have been held.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  ween Peep by 1 today.
   Fevers/HOTN:  evidence of sepsis/active infection with increased WBC,
   although fever curve slightly down since starting antibiotics.  Likely
   sources either lungs with VAP or urine source.
   Septic knee seems less likely, but will tap it.  Check LFTs, amylase,
   and lipase as part of fever workup.
   Right knee pain:  will tap right knee to w/u gout vs. septic knee.
   Acute on chronic renal failure:  replete fluids, as may be dry in
   setting of sepsis from infection.
   Pain:  will dose methadone at lower dose more frequently.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: Treated in the earlier on this admission for
   VAP now new concern for PNA given post-bronch CXR still looks like he
   has consolidations(?retrocardiac opacity), also with continuous fevers
   and leukocytosis. In the setting of slowly dropping mean BPs he could
   very well be in sepsis, however it is not certain that the source is
   pulmonary. Saturations have been good today and but is difficult to
   wean off vent. No further issues at this time with mucus plugging.
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP as tolerated
   -          Versed drip, bolus prn agitation
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   -          f/u BAL, cultures
   -          on IV vanco and doripenem for ?sepsis
   .
   #2  Fever: As above fevers with no clear source. Today
s UA is
   indicative of bacterial infection which is covered by doripenem.  Will
   follow up on blood and urine cultures, as well as pending sputum
   culture and BAL. Other thoughts include gout (patient has been
   receiving allopurinol but has been fluid down since admission and
   losing hydration via long-term vent and fevers) and given his tender
   knee on exam this could be the source of fever. Also to consider is
   meningitis however no reason to suspect this, he does not show signs of
   meningismus and mental status has been stable for some time. Continue
   antibiotics for now but once source is identify would narrow down
   coverage to decrease likelihood of causing resistance.
   -f/u blood culture
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff to finish off course (last day [**11-21**])
   - added IV vanco 1g q24h and Doripenem 250mg q8h
   -tap knee and consult rheum if necessary
   -new blood and sputum cultures 12/3
   .
   #3 Agitation: Having difficulty weaning from sedation. Per pharmacy
   recs will change methadone to 20mg tid dosing in hopes of keeping a
   steady opioid level during the day will help with weaning of sedation
   drip.
   -use versed bolus prn agitation, attempt to wean off drip
   -methadone 20mg tid po
   -seroquel
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Creatinine has been slowly increasing over
   several days which is also likely pre-renal dehydration. Will renally
   dose his medications, including allopurinol today. Otherwise there is
   no reason to suspect intrinsic renal disease. Zaroxylin and lasix have
   been stopped, and fluid boluses were initiated both for rising Cr and
   hypotensive episodes. This is again concerning for sepsis.
   -renally dose medications
   -1L NS bolus prn
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Several episodes
   of hypotension so labetalol and diovan will be held for now.
   - hold labetalol for hypotension
   - d/c diovan given hypotension
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled.  Meds held as above. Will
   monitor telemetry closely
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   .
   # Gout: Could potentially be the cause of his knee pain especially in
   the setting of dehydration and infection. Will tap knee today and send
   off cell count/cytology and cultures. ? Rheum consult.
   -f/u tap sample labs
   .
   FEN: tube feeds with free water boluses, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), type II diabetes mellitus (DM II), and ischemic cardiomyopathy. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute and chronic, atrial fibrillation (AF), and suspected pulmonary hypertension (PHTN).

The patient has been treated for community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Despite treatment, the patient continues to have fevers and leukocytosis, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The source of infection is not yet identified, with concerns including gout, meningitis, and sepsis.

The patient is experiencing agitation, likely due to sedation weaning difficulties. Medications have been adjusted to help with sedation management. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, likely due to pre-renal dehydration, and medication dosages have been adjusted accordingly.

The patient has a history of diabetes, for which he is receiving insulin, and ischemic cardiomyopathy with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and cocaine use. Blood pressure management is challenging, and certain medications have been held due to hypotensive episodes.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, gout flare-up, and potential bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy for atrial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who presented with sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypokalemia, anxiety, hypernatremia, epistaxis, alteration in elimination related to diarrhea, fever of unknown origin, obesity, nose bleed, history of acidosis, respiratory failure, acute heart failure, chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, history of diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which means he is not able to breathe adequately on his own. He is currently on mechanical ventilation support.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, indicating impaired filling of the heart and reduced cardiac output.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is characterized by a sudden loss of kidney function. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. This condition can strain the heart and lead to further complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: It is still unclear why vent wean is going so
   slowly.  It is unlikely that he has a VAP at this point given negative
   cultures (some still pending).  We are continuing to decrease PEEP each
   day, currently on 14 and FIO2 of 50%. It is only during periods of
   agitation (?[**1-14**] pain, insufficient sedation) that his FIO2 requirements
   and PEEP requirements increase.
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP as tolerated
   -          Versed bolus for agitation prn
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   -          f/u BAL, cultures
   -          will continue on current antibiotics for fever and ?sepsis
   until BAL and cultures are negative then d/c
   .
   #2  Fever: Given positive tap for gout, this was likely the underlying
   etiology. However cannot rule out infectious source completely given
   repeated fever spikes, hypotension. Will treat gout and follow up on
   outstanding cultures. At this point it is unlikely due to a drug
   fever.  It is possible he is seeding from somewhere like heart valve,
   intra-abdominal process, but given we have a positive knee tap for gout
   we will treat this and not look for another nidus of infection. If he
   continues to spike despite gout treatment and resolution would continue
   to keep looking for the source of his fevers.
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff (longer course now that he
s back on IV
   antibiotics)
   - added IV vanco 1g q24h and Doripenem 250mg q8h
   -treat gout w/colchicine and prednisone
   -continue to trend fever curve, do not need to culture every day
   .
   # Gout: Positive knee tap. Renally dosed allopurinol, and added on
   colchicine (also renally dosed) and prednisone. Continue to bolus IV
   fluids.
   -allopurinol, colchicine and prednisone
   .
   #3 Agitation: Brief periods of agitation causing increased respiratory
   work. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pain since he is also tachycardic and goes up
   in BP during these episodes. Methadone to 20mg tid and seroquel daily
   for pain and sedation, and continuing to wean off IV sedation slowly.
   -use versed bolus prn agitation, attempt to wean off drip
   -methadone 20mg tid po
   -seroquel qd
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Creatinine has been slowly increasing over
   several days which is also likely pre-renal dehydration. He has been
   responsive to IV boluses with improved urine output and a decrease in
   Cr. He has multiple reasons for dehydration including long-term MV and
   fever. Will continue to hydrate prn and monitor UOP
   -renally dose medications
   -1L NS bolus prn
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   -no need for HD at this time
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Restarted
   labetalol and diovan. Monitor closely as pt has periods of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled on labetalol.
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds with free water boluses, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed (L arm)

He is currently admitted to the ICU for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O. His respiratory support is being weaned off as tolerated. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate (HR) of 71 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 91/58 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. The patient's tracheostomy tube is in place, and he is being ventilated with a volume control mode.

2. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers despite treatment for CAP and VAP. A knee aspiration culture revealed needle-shaped negative birefringent crystals, consistent with gout. The patient is being treated for gout and ongoing cultures are pending. It is unclear whether the fever is due to an infectious"

   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   #1 Respiratory Failure: It is still unclear why vent wean is going so
   slowly.  It is unlikely that he has a VAP at this point given negative
   cultures (some still pending).  We are continuing to decrease PEEP each
   day, currently on 14 and FIO2 of 50%. It is only during periods of
   agitation (?[**1-14**] pain, insufficient sedation) that his FIO2 requirements
   and PEEP requirements increase.
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP as tolerated
   -          Versed bolus for agitation prn
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   -          f/u BAL, cultures
   -          will continue on current antibiotics for fever and ?sepsis
   until BAL and cultures are negative then d/c
   .
   #2  Fever: Given positive tap for gout, this was likely the underlying
   etiology. However cannot rule out infectious source completely given
   repeated fever spikes, hypotension. Will treat gout and follow up on
   outstanding cultures. At this point it is unlikely due to a drug
   fever.  It is possible he is seeding from somewhere like heart valve,
   intra-abdominal process, but given we have a positive knee tap for gout
   we will treat this and not look for another nidus of infection. If he
   continues to spike despite gout treatment and resolution would continue
   to keep looking for the source of his fevers.
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff (longer course now that he
s back on IV
   antibiotics)
   - added IV vanco 1g q24h and Doripenem 250mg q8h
   -treat gout w/colchicine and prednisone
   -continue to trend fever curve, do not need to culture every day
   .
   # Gout: Positive knee tap. Renally dosed allopurinol, and added on
   colchicine (also renally dosed) and prednisone. Continue to bolus IV
   fluids.
   -allopurinol, colchicine and prednisone
   .
   #3 Agitation: Brief periods of agitation causing increased respiratory
   work. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pain since he is also tachycardic and goes up
   in BP during these episodes. Methadone to 20mg tid and seroquel daily
   for pain and sedation, and continuing to wean off IV sedation slowly.
   -use versed bolus prn agitation, attempt to wean off drip
   -methadone 20mg tid po
   -seroquel qd
   #4 Acute Renal failure:  Creatinine has been slowly increasing over
   several days which is also likely pre-renal dehydration. He has been
   responsive to IV boluses with improved urine output and a decrease in
   Cr. He has multiple reasons for dehydration including long-term MV and
   fever. Will continue to hydrate prn and monitor UOP
   -renally dose medications
   -1L NS bolus prn
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   -no need for HD at this time
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Restarted
   labetalol and diovan. Monitor closely as pt has periods of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled on labetalol.
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds with free water boluses, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, electrolyte and fluid disorder, anxiety, hypernatremia, epistaxis, fever of unknown origin, and obesity.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and CPAP/PSV mode. PEEP is being decreased each day, currently at 14, and FiO2 is set at 50%. The patient's FiO2 requirements and PEEP requirements increase during periods of agitation or pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   # Cdiff colitis: last positive cdiff [**10-16**], on PO vanco. Today new
   increase in abd distention. KUB concerning, 12 cm RLL colon. Read
   suggests ileus but concerning for toxic megacolon given history.
   -          NG tube for decompression
   -          Start IV flagyl on top of PO vanco
   -          Surgery consult pending
   -          PO contrast CT abd
   # Respiratory Failure: It is still unclear why vent wean is going so
   slowly.  It is unlikely that he has a VAP at this point given negative
   cultures (some still pending).  We are continuing to attempt to
   decrease PEEP each day, currently on 14-16 and FIO2 of 50%. He is
   resistant to decreasing PEEP further, when attempted he desats,
   especially  during periods of agitation (?[**1-14**] pain, insufficient
   sedation.
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP as tolerated
   -          Versed and fentanyl bolus for agitation prn
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   -          f/u BAL, cultures
   -          d/c doripenem and IV vanco  for fever and ?sepsis since BAL
   and cultures remain negative
   .
   #  Fever: Given positive tap for gout, this was likely the underlying
   etiology. However cannot rule out infectious source completely given
   repeated fever spikes, hypotension. Will treat gout and follow up on
   outstanding cultures. At this point it is unlikely due to a drug
   fever.  It is possible he is seeding from somewhere like heart valve,
   intra-abdominal process, but given we have a positive knee tap for gout
   we will treat this and not look for another nidus of infection. If he
   continues to spike despite gout treatment and resolution would continue
   to keep looking for the source of his fevers.
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
   -continue PO vanco for c.diff (longer course now that he
s back on IV
   antibiotics)
   - added IV vanco 1g q24h and Doripenem 250mg q8h
   -treat gout w/colchicine and prednisone
   -continue to trend fever curve, do not need to culture every day
   .
   # Gout: Positive knee tap. Renally dosed allopurinol, and added on
   colchicine (also renally dosed) and prednisone. Continue to bolus IV
   fluids.
   -allopurinol, colchicine and prednisone
   .
   # Agitation: Brief periods of agitation causing increased respiratory
   work. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pain since he is also tachycardic and goes up
   in BP during these episodes. Methadone to 20mg tid and seroquel daily
   for pain and sedation, and continuing to wean off IV sedation slowly.
   -use versed bolus prn agitation, attempt to wean off drip
   -methadone 20mg tid po
   -seroquel qd
   # Acute Renal failure:  Creatinine has been slowly increasing over
   several days which is also likely pre-renal dehydration. He has been
   responsive to IV boluses with improved urine output and a decrease in
   Cr. He has multiple reasons for dehydration including long-term MV and
   fever. Will continue to hydrate prn and monitor UOP
   -renally dose medications
   -1L NS bolus prn
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   -no need for HD at this time
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Restarted
   labetalol and diovan. Monitor closely as pt has periods of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled on labetalol.
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   .
   FEN: tube feeds with free water boluses, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed (L arm)
   .
   Dispo:  continue to wean off sedation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history including morbid obesity, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), and acute renal failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with septic shock and subsequent development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Fever: The patient has had repeated episodes of fever, which could be due to an underlying infection such as gout or another infectious source. Cultures have been taken, and antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.

2. Abdominal Distention and Toxic Megacolon: The patient's abdominal distention has worsened, and there is a concern for toxic megacolon. An NG tube has been placed for decompression, and the patient is being treated with IV Flagyl on top of PO vancomycin.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to struggle with weaning off the ventilator, likely due to factors such as insufficient sedation, pain, or an underlying lung condition. PEEP is being decreased as tolerated, and the patient is receiving nebulizer treatments.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing, indicating pre-renal dehydration. The patient is being hydrated with IV fluids and monitored for urine output.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers post treatment for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy and doboff catheter in place. The patient's recent developments include fever spikes, worsening abdominal distention, and positive test for gout. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/71 mmHg to 137/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Toxic Megacolon: The patient's increasing abdominal distention and the presence of a 12 cm right lower lobe colon on the KUB suggest the possibility of toxic megacolon, a severe complication of C. diff colitis. Immediate decompression with an NG tube and further management may be necessary.
2. Ventilator-Weaning Failure: Despite attempts to decrease PEEP and FiO2, the patient remains dependent on high levels of support, indicating a possible ventilator-weaning failure. Close monitoring and further evaluation are needed to identify the cause and facilitate successful we"

   .
   # Fever: Unclear source. Patient has had fever for >1 week continuously
   after short period of being afebrile.  Patient has otherwise been
   febrile through entire stay. Positive cultures are limited to: MSSA
   positive nasal swab on [**10-10**] (from purulent exudate), 1x positive Cdiff
   ([**10-16**]), and 2x positive BCx with Coag negative staph resistant to
   Oxacillin ([**10-22**] and [**10-24**]). All other cultures have since been
   negative, including mycolitic and AFB blood cultures on [**11-3**].  Had
   arthrocentesis that showed gout, which may have contributed to fever,
   although patient has been treated and seems clinically improved (is no
   longer withdrawing from palpation to R knee) but is still spiking
   fevers.  Patient has had 2x abdominal CT that did not show source of
   infection. Most recent abdominal/pelvis CT w/PO contrast showed
   distention but no other evidence of colitis or other nidus of
   infection.  Patient has had normal RUQ u/s and normal LFTs as well.
   Patient had TTE with decent visualization of the mitral and aortic
   valves that showed no endocarditis, and patient has had no positive
   blood cultures throughout the last 3 weeks of spiking temperatures.
   Haldol was d/c approximately one week ago for concern of NMS w/out
   resolution of fever.  Patient with no focal neurologic findings
   (although exam is admittedly limited due to patients mental status and
   body habitus) to suggest epidural abscess, but patient likely not a
   candidate for MRI regardless.  Dorepenem and IV vancomycin d/c after
   several days of empiric treatment without source and continued fever.
   -check stool for Cdiff (last was [**10-16**])
   -continue empiric cdiff management with po vanco and IV flagyl
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
   -continue to treat gout w/colchicine and prednisone
   -continue to trend fever curve, do not need to culture every day
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially a result of decompensated CHF in
   setting of cocaine abuse.  Unable to wean PEEP below 14 during any
   portion of MICU stay (last time was immediately pre-tracheostomy).  It
   is still unclear why vent wean is going so slowly.  Likely a
   combination of body habitus, underlying intrinsic lung disease, fluid
   overload, and intermittent mucous plugging (as has been visualized
   directly on bronchoscopy).  Most recent bronchoscopy after self removal
   of trachestomy showed trachea is relatively collapsible and this may
   also contribute to intermittent desaturation and high PEEP
   requirement.   It is unlikely that he has a VAP contributing at this
   point given serial negative sputum cultures, unresponsiveness to
   antibiotics, and chronic nature of his respiratory failure.  We are
   continuing to attempt to decrease PEEP each day, currently on 14-16 and
   FIO2 of 50%. He is resistant to decreasing PEEP further, when attempted
   he desaturates, especially during periods of agitation.
   -          Continue to attempt to ween PEEP as tolerated
   -          Standing seroquel for agitation
   -          Versed and fentanyl bolus for agitation prn
   -          continue nebulizer treatments
   -          f/u BAL and sputum cultures

   # Cdiff colitis: last positive cdiff [**10-16**], on PO vanco and now on
   Flagyl IV since yesterday. Yesterday team noted new(?) increase in
   abdominal distention with KUB showing distended colon. Concern for
   toxic megacolon, patient to CT abdomen and surgery consulted.  CT
   abdomen c/w illeus w/out evidence of colitis.
   - NG tube initially for decompression

   - narcan po for illeus related to opiate use
   - continue po vancomycin

   # Gout: Positive arthrocentesis. Renally dosed allopurinol, and added
   on colchicine (also renally dosed) and prednisone. Continue to bolus IV
   fluids.
   - renally dosed allopurinol
   - renally dosed colchicine and 20mg PO prednisone until fever gone
   and/or clinically improved

   # Agitation: Brief periods of agitation causing increased respiratory
   work. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pain since he is also tachycardic and goes up
   in BP during these episodes. Methadone 20mg tid for pain and weaning of

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers post treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is morbidly obese and has been intubated and mechanically ventilated since admission.

The patient's chief complaint is fever, and he has had a continuous fever for over a week. Positive cultures include methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) from a nasal swab, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, and two positive blood cultures with coag-negative staph resistant to oxacillin. All other cultures have been negative.

The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including an abdominal CT with PO contrast, which showed distended cecum and air-fluid levels without evidence of colitis. A bronchoscopy showed tracheal collapse and no evidence of pneumonia. The patient also had an arthrocentesis revealing gout, which may have contributed to his fever. 

The patient has been treated with various medications, including dorepenem, intravenous vancomycin, oral vancomycin, and intravenous Flagyl for C. difficile colitis. His respiratory failure is attributed to decompensated CHF, underlying intrinsic lung disease, fluid overload, and intermittent mucous plugging."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   # Cdiff colitis: last positive cdiff [**10-16**], on PO vanco. Today new
   increase in abd distention. KUB concerning, 12 cm RLL colon. Read
   suggests ileus but concerning for toxic megacolon given history.
   -          NG tube for decompression
   -          Start IV flagyl on top of PO vanco
   -          Surgery consult pending
   -          PO contrast CT abd
   # Respiratory Failure: It is still unclear why vent wean is going so
   slowly.  It is unlikely that he has a VAP at this point given negative
   cultures (some still pending).  We are continuing to attempt to
   decrease PEEP each day, currently on 14-16 and FIO2 of 50%. He is
   resistant to decreasing PEEP further, when attempted he desats,
   especially  during periods of agitation (?[**1-14**] pain, insufficient
   sedation.
   -          Continue to ween off PEEP as tolerated
   -          Versed and fentanyl bolus for agitation prn
   -          continue nebulizer treatment
   -          f/u BAL, cultures
   -          d/c doripenem and IV vanco  for fever and ?sepsis since BAL
   and cultures remain negative
   - to bronch today to investigate granulation tissue built up distal to
   trach to explain high PEEP requirement with relatively low PIP
   .
   #  Fever: Given positive tap for gout, this was likely comtributing.
   infectious source still possible given repeated fever spikes,
   hypotension. Will treat gout and follow up on outstanding cultures.
   Given new abd distenstion concern fever [**1-14**] cdiff. Given BAL cultures
   remain negative and retrocardiac opacity less impressive on f/u CXR
   d/cing abx today.  At this point it is unlikely due to a drug fever.
   It is possible he is seeding from somewhere like heart valve,
   intra-abdominal process, but given we have a positive knee tap for gout
   we will treat this and not look for another nidus of infection. If he
   continues to spike despite gout treatment and resolution would continue
   to keep looking for the source of his fevers.
   -cdiff management as above
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
   -d/ced IV vanco 1g q24h and Doripenem 250mg q8h
   -treat gout w/colchicine and prednisone
   -continue to trend fever curve, do not need to culture every day
   .
   # Gout: Positive knee tap. Renally dosed allopurinol, and added on
   colchicine (also renally dosed) and prednisone. Continue to bolus IV
   fluids.
   -allopurinol, colchicine and prednisone
   .
   # Agitation: Brief periods of agitation causing increased respiratory
   work. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pain since he is also tachycardic and goes up
   in BP during these episodes. Methadone to 20mg tid and seroquel daily
   for pain and sedation, and continuing to wean off IV sedation slowly.
   -use versed and fentanyl bolus prn agitation, off drip
   -methadone 20mg q6h po
   -seroquel
   # Acute Renal failure:  Creatinine has been slowly increasing over
   several days which is also likely pre-renal dehydration. He has been
   responsive to IV boluses with improved urine output and a decrease in
   Cr. He has multiple reasons for dehydration including long-term MV and
   fever. Will continue to hydrate prn and monitor UOP
   -renally dose medications
   -1L NS bolus prn
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   -no need for HD at this time
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Restarted
   labetalol and diovan. Monitor closely as pt has periods of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled on labetalol.
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   .
   FEN hold TF given ileus, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC placed (L arm)
   .
   Dispo: surgical eval,  continue to wean off sedation and peep

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers. He has been treated for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's recent events include the removal of his tracheostomy tube due to it falling out, replacement with a new one, and subsequent advancement to a larger size. A bronchoscopy was performed to investigate granulation tissue built up distal to the tracheostomy tube. The patient also had a new nasogastric (NG) tube placed due to abdominal distension. Imaging showed air-fluid levels, distended cecum, and air in the rectum, but no evidence of colitis. Surgery consultations have been obtained, and surgical intervention has been deferred at this time. The patient was started on Flagyl in addition to PO vancomycin for C. diff. He continues to be agitated, and his respiratory failure is still present. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.7°F, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/97 mmHg to 159/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FIO2 of 50%. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. The patient's medical team is concerned about potential medical complications such as toxic megacolon, continued respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and agitation. The plan includes continuing to wean off PEEP as tolerated, administering versed and fentanyl boluses for agitation, treating gout, and monitoring for fever spikes and outstanding cultures."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, atrial fibrillation, chronic respiratory failure, and renal failure. The patient's chief complaint is an altered mental status and fever. The patient has undergone several procedures, including bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, and nasogastric tube placement. He also has a history of nosebleeds, anxiety, hypernatremia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that could arise. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, altered mental status, and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is necessary.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and his lab results show increasing creatinine levels. Monitoring urine output and adjusting fluid and medication management accordingly is crucial.

4. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hypernatremia. These imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   .
   # Fever: Unclear source. The patient has been febrile on/off since his
   admission.  At this point, we have ruled out all main souces of
   infection including pulmonary (no growth on sputum or BAL culture to
   date), bacteremia (no growth on blood cultures), intra-abdominal
   (negative CT A/P), stool (negative C.diff), skin (no new wounds,
   rashes), endocardial (old TTE shows normal valves and no positive
   cultures), instrumentation (blood cultures negative despite PICC still
   being in, foley changes with suspicion of dirty UA). Since his
   admission his infectious history includes: MSSA positive nasal swab on
   [**10-10**] (from purulent exudate), 1x positive Cdiff ([**10-16**]), and 2x
   positive BCx with Coag negative staph resistant to Oxacillin ([**10-22**] and
   [**10-24**]). His gout flare-up was treated with colchicine and prednisone
   and he appears clinically improved, however he is still spiking fevers.
   Antibiotics (IV vanco and doripenem) were stopped after a short 3 day
   course after he became hemodynamically stable and sepsis was no longer
   on the differential. Additionally, drug fever was taken into account
   and the only medication identified that could cause such reaction
   (haldol) was d/c
d, with continued fever spikes.  At this point the
   only other option to consider is non-infectious, autoimmune etiologies
   which, in this setting would likely yield nonspecific results.
   -monitor for increasing stool output and abd distension (now improved);
   cdiff negative
   -last day of po vanco tomorrow ([**11-21**])
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
   -continue to treat gout w/colchicine for 2 week course
   -continue to trend fever curve, do not need to culture every day
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially a result of decompensated CHF in
   setting of cocaine abuse.  Has been on PS and AC for most of his stay,
   allowing for wean of PEEP to approximately 14. He frequently becomes
   agitated and desaturates when his PEEP is decreased further than this.
   Most recent bronchoscopy after self removal of trachestomy showed
   trachea is relatively collapsible and this may also contribute to
   intermittent desaturation and high PEEP requirement.   At this point it
   is highly unlikely that he has an underlying PNA complicating his
   wean.  We are continuing to attempt to decrease PEEP each day,
   currently on 14-16 and FIO2 of 50%. Continue to attempt to ween PEEP as
   tolerated
   -          Standing seroquel 150mg po tid (check EKG today)
   -          Versed and fentanyl bolus for agitation prn
   -          continue nebulizer treatments
   -          f/u BAL and sputum cultures
   .
   # Cdiff colitis: Concern for toxic megacolon, patient to CT abdomen and
   surgery consulted.  CT abdomen c/w illeus w/out evidence of colitis.
   His last day of po vanco tomorrow.
   - NG tube in place
   - limit fentanyl to prn, control agitation with seroquel
   - narcan po for illeus
   - d/c po vanco tomorrow
   .
   # Gout: Positive arthrocentesis. Renally dosed allopurinol and
   colchicine. Prednisone was d/c yesterday for 3 day course. Will
   continue colchicine for 2 weeks. Continue to bolus IV fluids.
   - renally dosed allopurinol
   - renally dosed colchicine and 20mg PO prednisone until fever gone
   and/or clinically improved
   .
   # Agitation: Brief periods of agitation causing increased respiratory
   work. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pain since he is also tachycardic and goes up
   in BP during these episodes. Methadone 20mg tid for pain and weaning of
   fentanyl and seroquel standing for agitation.
   - wean off drip, use bolus versed instead
   - methadone 20mg q6h po
   - seroquel 200mg tid, check EKG for QT prolongation today
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Cr slowly improving with hydration and renally
   dosed medications. Continue to monitor.
   -renally dose medications
   -1L NS bolus prn
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: MI in [**2129**] [**1-14**] cocaine abuse. Restarted
   labetalol and diovan. Monitor closely as pt has periods of hypotension.
   -labetalol, diovan hold for now given periods of hypotension
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: currently off labetalol for episodes of
   hypotension. Has been 60-90s overall.
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   .
   FEN:  start TF with free water bolus for hypernatremia, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC (L arm)
   .
   Dispo: continue to wean off sedation and peep

The patient's recent history includes a gout flare-up, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Fever: The patient has been febrile on/off since admission, with unclear sources of infection. Main sources of infection have been ruled out including pulmonary, bacteremia, intra-abdominal, stool, skin, endocardial, and instrumentation.
- Respiratory Failure: The patient has been on pressure support and assisted control ventilation (PS/ACV) for most of his stay, allowing for weaning of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to approximately 14. The patient frequently becomes agitated and desaturates when PEEP is decreased further than this.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   .
   # Fever: Unclear source. Patient has had fever for >1 week continuously
   after short period of being afebrile.  Patient has otherwise been
   febrile through entire stay. Positive cultures are limited to: MSSA
   positive nasal swab on [**10-10**] (from purulent exudate), 1x positive Cdiff
   ([**10-16**]), and 2x positive BCx with Coag negative staph resistant to
   Oxacillin ([**10-22**] and [**10-24**]). All other cultures have since been
   negative, including mycolitic and AFB blood cultures on [**11-3**].  Had
   arthrocentesis that showed gout, which may have contributed to fever,
   although patient has been treated and seems clinically improved (is no
   longer withdrawing from palpation to R knee) but is still spiking
   fevers.  Patient has had 2x abdominal CT that did not show source of
   infection. Most recent abdominal/pelvis CT w/PO contrast showed
   distention but no other evidence of colitis or other nidus of
   infection.  Patient has had normal RUQ u/s and normal LFTs as well.
   Patient had TTE with decent visualization of the mitral and aortic
   valves that showed no endocarditis, and patient has had no positive
   blood cultures throughout the last 3 weeks of spiking temperatures.
   Haldol was d/c approximately one week ago for concern of NMS w/out
   resolution of fever.  Patient with no focal neurologic findings
   (although exam is admittedly limited due to patients mental status and
   body habitus) to suggest epidural abscess, but patient likely not a
   candidate for MRI regardless.  Dorepenem and IV vancomycin d/c after
   several days of empiric treatment without source and continued fever.
   -check stool for Cdiff (last was [**10-16**])
   -continue empiric cdiff management with po vanco and IV flagyl
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
   -continue to treat gout w/colchicine and prednisone
   -continue to trend fever curve, do not need to culture every day
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially a result of decompensated CHF in
   setting of cocaine abuse.  Unable to wean PEEP below 14 during any
   portion of MICU stay (last time was immediately pre-tracheostomy).  It
   is still unclear why vent wean is going so slowly.  Likely a
   combination of body habitus, underlying intrinsic lung disease, fluid
   overload, and intermittent mucous plugging (as has been visualized
   directly on bronchoscopy).  Most recent bronchoscopy after self removal
   of trachestomy showed trachea is relatively collapsible and this may
   also contribute to intermittent desaturation and high PEEP
   requirement.   It is unlikely that he has a VAP contributing at this
   point given serial negative sputum cultures, unresponsiveness to
   antibiotics, and chronic nature of his respiratory failure.  We are
   continuing to attempt to decrease PEEP each day, currently on 14-16 and
   FIO2 of 50%. He is resistant to decreasing PEEP further, when attempted
   he desaturates, especially during periods of agitation.
   -          Continue to attempt to ween PEEP as tolerated
   -          Standing seroquel for agitation
   -          Versed and fentanyl bolus for agitation prn
   -          continue nebulizer treatments
   -          f/u BAL and sputum cultures
   .
   # Cdiff colitis: last positive cdiff [**10-16**], on PO vanco and now on
   Flagyl IV since yesterday. Yesterday team noted new(?) increase in
   abdominal distention with KUB showing distended colon. Concern for
   toxic megacolon, patient to CT abdomen and surgery consulted.  CT
   abdomen c/w illeus w/out evidence of colitis.
   - NG tube initially for decompression
   - limit fentanyl to prn, control agitation with seroquel
   - narcan po for illeus related to opiate use
   - continue po vancomycin
   - d/c flagyl
   - re-check stool c-diff
   .
   # Gout: Positive arthrocentesis. Renally dosed allopurinol, and added
   on colchicine (also renally dosed) and prednisone. Continue to bolus IV
   fluids.
   - renally dosed allopurinol
   - renally dosed colchicine and 20mg PO prednisone until fever gone
   and/or clinically improved
   .
   # Agitation: Brief periods of agitation causing increased respiratory
   work. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pain since he is also tachycardic and goes up
   in BP during these episodes. Methadone 20mg tid for pain and weaning of
   fentanyl and seroquel standing for agitation.
   - use versed and fentanyl bolus prn agitation, off drip
   - methadone 20mg q6h po
 to consider increasing dose tomorrow if
   continues to require fentanyl boluses
   - keep seroquel standing dose the same and add PRN seroquel as first
   choice in PRN medication for agitation
 to consider increasing dose if
   agitation persists
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Creatinine has been slowly increasing over
   several days which is also likely pre-renal dehydration. He has been
   responsive to IV boluses with improved urine output and a decrease in
   Cr. He has multiple reasons for dehydration including long-term MV and
   fever. Will continue to hydrate prn and monitor UOP
   -renally dose medications
   -1L NS bolus prn
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   -no need for HD at this time
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: prior MI [**1-14**] cocaine use. Restarted
   labetalol and diovan. Monitor closely as pt has periods of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled on labetalol.
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   .
   FEN small TF given ileus, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, H2 blocker, bowel regimen.
   .
   Access: PICC (L arm)
   .
   Dispo: continue to wean off sedation and peep

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, fluid overload, respiratory failure, and persistent fevers post treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (COPD) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been experiencing continuous fever for over a week after a short period of being afebrile. The patient's current symptoms include agitation, difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation, and intermittent mucous plugging. He also has a positive culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) nasal swab, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and Bacillus cereus. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and blood glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers despite treatment for COPD and VAP. The source of the fever is unclear, and further investigations are needed to identify the underlying cause.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors including his morbid obesity, underlying intrinsic lung disease, fluid overload, and intermittent mucous plugging. Weaning off mechanical ventilation remains challenging, and the patient requires ongoing support.
3. C. diff colitis: The patient has a positive C. diff stool culture, and there is concern for C."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   .
   # Fever: Unclear source. The patient has been febrile on/off since his
   admission.  At this point, we have ruled out all main souces of
   infection including pulmonary (no growth on sputum or BAL culture to
   date), bacteremia (no growth on blood cultures), intra-abdominal
   (negative CT A/P), stool (negative C.diff), skin (no new wounds,
   rashes), endocardial (old TTE shows normal valves and no positive
   cultures), instrumentation (blood cultures negative despite PICC still
   being in, foley changes with suspicion of dirty UA). Since his
   admission his infectious history includes: MSSA positive nasal swab on
   [**10-10**] (from purulent exudate), 1x positive Cdiff ([**10-16**]), and 2x
   positive BCx with Coag negative staph resistant to Oxacillin ([**10-22**] and
   [**10-24**]). His gout flare-up was treated with colchicine and prednisone
   and he appears clinically improved, however he is still spiking fevers.
   Antibiotics (IV vanco and doripenem) were stopped after a short 3 day
   course after he became hemodynamically stable and sepsis was no longer
   on the differential. Additionally, drug fever was taken into account
   and the only medication identified that could cause such reaction
   (haldol) was d/c
d, with continued fever spikes.  At this point the
   only other option to consider is non-infectious, autoimmune etiologies
   which, in this setting would likely yield nonspecific results.
   -monitor for increasing stool output and abd distension (now improved);
   cdiff negative
   -last day of po vanco tomorrow ([**11-21**])
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
   -continue to treat gout w/colchicine for 2 week course
   -continue to trend fever curve, do not need to culture every day
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially a result of decompensated CHF in
   setting of cocaine abuse.  Has been on PS and AC for most of his stay,
   allowing for wean of PEEP to approximately 14. He frequently becomes
   agitated and desaturates when his PEEP is decreased further than this.
   Most recent bronchoscopy after self removal of trachestomy showed
   trachea is relatively collapsible and this may also contribute to
   intermittent desaturation and high PEEP requirement.   At this point it
   is highly unlikely that he has an underlying PNA complicating his
   wean.  We are continuing to attempt to decrease PEEP each day,
   currently on 14-16 and FIO2 of 50%. Continue to attempt to ween PEEP as
   tolerated
   -          Standing seroquel 150mg po tid (check EKG today)
   -          Versed and fentanyl bolus for agitation prn
   -          continue nebulizer treatments

   surgery consulted.  CT abdomen c/w illeus w/out evidence of colitis.
   His last day of po vanco tomorrow.
   - NG tube in place
   - limit fentanyl to prn, control agitation with seroquel
   - narcan po for illeus
   - d/c po vanco tomorrow
   .
   # Gout: Positive arthrocentesis. Renally dosed allopurinol and
   colchicine. Prednisone was d/c yesterday for 3 day course. Will
   continue colchicine for 2 weeks. Continue to bolus IV fluids.
   - renally dosed allopurinol
   - renally dosed colchicine and 20mg PO prednisone until fever gone
   and/or clinically improved
   .
   # Agitation: Brief periods of agitation causing increased respiratory
   work. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pain since he is also tachycardic and goes up
   in BP during these episodes. Methadone 20mg tid for pain and weaning of
   fentanyl and seroquel standing for agitation.
   - wean off drip, use bolus versed instead
   - methadone 20mg q6h po
   - seroquel 200mg tid, check EKG for QT prolongation today

   # Acute Renal failure:  Cr slowly improving with hydration and renally
   dosed medications. Continue to monitor.
   -renally dose medications
   -1L NS bolus prn
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   .
   # Fever: Unclear source. The patient has been febrile on/off since his
   admission.  At this point, we have ruled out all main souces of
   infection including pulmonary (no growth on sputum or BAL culture to
   date), bacteremia (no growth on blood cultures), intra-abdominal
   (negative CT A/P), stool (negative C.diff), skin (no new wounds,
   rashes), endocardial (old TTE shows normal valves and no positive
   cultures), instrumentation (blood cultures negative despite PICC still
   being in, foley changes with suspicion of dirty UA). Since his
   admission his infectious history includes: MSSA positive nasal swab on
   [**10-10**] (from purulent exudate), 1x positive Cdiff ([**10-16**]), and 2x
   positive BCx with Coag negative staph resistant to Oxacillin ([**10-22**] and
   [**10-24**]). His gout flare-up was treated with colchicine and prednisone
   and he appears clinically improved, however he is still spiking fevers.
   Antibiotics (IV vanco and doripenem) were stopped after a short 3 day
   course after he became hemodynamically stable and sepsis was no longer
   on the differential. Additionally, drug fever was taken into account
   and the only medication identified that could cause such reaction
   (haldol) was d/c
d, with continued fever spikes.  At this point the
   only other option to consider is non-infectious, autoimmune etiologies
   which, in this setting would likely yield nonspecific results.
   -monitor for increasing stool output and abd distension (now improved);
   cdiff negative
   -last day of po vanco [**11-21**]
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
 negative as [**11-21**]
   -continue to treat gout w/colchicine for 2 week course
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially a result of decompensated CHF in
   setting of cocaine abuse.  Has been on PS and AC for most of his stay,
   allowing for wean of PEEP to approximately 14. He frequently becomes
   agitated and desaturates when his PEEP is decreased further than this.
   Most recent bronchoscopy after self removal of trachestomy showed
   trachea is relatively collapsible and this may also contribute to
   intermittent desaturation and high PEEP requirement.   At this point it
   is highly unlikely that he has an underlying PNA complicating his
   wean.  We are continuing to attempt to decrease PEEP each day,
   currently on 14-16 and FIO2 of 50%. Continue to attempt to ween PEEP as
   tolerated

   surgery consulted.  CT abdomen c/w illeus w/out evidence of colitis.
   His last day of po vanco tomorrow.
   - NG tube in place
   - limit fentanyl to prn, control agitation with seroquel
   - narcan po for illeus
   - d/c PO Vanc [**11-21**]

   # Gout: Positive arthrocentesis. Renally dosed allopurinol and
   colchicine. Prednisone was d/c yesterday for 3 day course. Will
   continue colchicine for 2 weeks. Continue to bolus IV fluids.
   - renally dosed allopurinol
   - renally dosed colchicine for two weeks total until [**11-30**]
   .
   # Agitation: Brief periods of agitation causing increased respiratory
   work. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pain since he is also tachycardic and goes up
   in BP during these episodes. Methadone 20mg tid for pain and weaning of
   fentanyl and seroquel standing for agitation.   Pt more clear and
   interactive today, though still pulling at trach overnight.
   - weaned off drip, d/c
d versed
   - methadone 20mg q6h po
   - seroquel 200mg tid, will check EKG today to check for ORS changes
   with new seroquel dosing

   # Acute Renal failure:  Cr slowly improving with hydration and renally
   dosed medications. Continue to monitor.
   -renally dose medications
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   # Elevated Transaminases
 slight bump in LFTs
   -possibly due to seroquel
 will continue to monitor
 goal is to
   eventually wean seroquel and stop when pt

   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, and cocaine abuse. He was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to decompensated CHF and subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also presented with fever, agitation, and altered mental status, leading to concerns for central nervous system (CNS) infection or sepsis. He has been treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, gout flare-up, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's renal function has improved with hydration and renally dosed medications. His transaminases are slightly elevated, which may be due to seroquel use. The patient has been weaned off sedation and PEEP, but still requires supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with intermittent desaturation and high PEEP requirement. Further attempts to wean PEEP should be made while monitoring oxygen saturation levels.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): Despite ruling out main sources of infection, the patient continues to spike fevers. Non-infectious causes such as drug fever or autoimmune etiologies should be considered.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have been elevated but are now trending downward. Continuous monitoring and free water boluses with tube feeds are recommended to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's mental status has improved, with agitation resolving. Coreg was started for blood pressure in the 140s and heart rate in the 90s. Seroquel dosage was decreased to 150 TID due to QTc of 493. The patient tolerated PEEP of 5 from noon to 1900, but increased back to 10 PEEP for RR increase. Sodium level was corrected to 146. The patient is unable to be screened yesterday and plans for discharge to rehab today. Allergies include Capoten (Oral) with a cough as a reaction. The last dose of antibiotics was Metronidazole on 11/19/2141 at 08:00 AM, and Vancomycin on 11/20/2141 at 12:15 PM. The patient is currently on heparin sodium (prophylaxis) since 11/22/2141 at 04:39 AM. Other ICU medications include coreg, seroquel, and unspecified other medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a morbidly obese 53-year-old man with CHF, DM II, fluid
   overload, respiratory failure and persistent fevers post treatment for
   CONS bacteremia and VAP.
   .
   # Fever: Unclear source but resolved. The patient has been febrile
   on/off since his admission.  At this point, we have ruled out all main
   souces of infection including pulmonary (no growth on sputum or BAL
   culture to date), bacteremia (no growth on blood cultures),
   intra-abdominal (negative CT A/P), stool (negative C.diff), skin (no
   new wounds, rashes), endocardial (old TTE shows normal valves and no
   positive cultures), instrumentation (blood cultures negative despite
   PICC still being in, foley changes with suspicion of dirty UA). Since
   his admission his infectious history includes: MSSA positive nasal swab
   on [**10-10**] (from purulent exudate), 1x positive Cdiff ([**10-16**]), and 2x
   positive BCx with Coag negative staph resistant to Oxacillin ([**10-22**] and
   [**10-24**]). His gout flare-up was treated with colchicine and prednisone
   and he appears clinically improved, however he is still spiking fevers.
   Antibiotics (IV vanco and doripenem) were stopped after a short 3 day
   course after he became hemodynamically stable and sepsis was no longer
   on the differential. Additionally, drug fever was taken into account
   and the only medication identified that could cause such reaction
   (haldol) was d/c
d, with continued fever spikes.  At this point the
   only other option to consider is non-infectious, autoimmune etiologies
   which, in this setting would likely yield nonspecific results.
   -completed po vanco course for c.diff
   -f/u blood culture, BAL, sputum cx
 negative as [**11-22**]
   -continue to treat gout w/colchicine for 2 week course
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initially a result of decompensated CHF in
   setting of cocaine abuse.  Has been on PS and AC for most of his stay,
   allowing for wean of PEEP to approximately 14. He frequently becomes
   agitated and desaturates when his PEEP is decreased further than this.
   Most recent bronchoscopy after self removal of trachestomy showed
   trachea is relatively collapsible and this may also contribute to
   intermittent desaturation and high PEEP requirement.   At this point it
   is highly unlikely that he has an underlying PNA complicating his
   wean.  We are continuing to attempt to decrease PEEP each day,
   currently on 14-16 and FIO2 of 50%. Continue to attempt to ween PEEP as
   tolerated
   -          Seroquel changed to150 TID standing dose
   -          continue nebulizer treatments
   -          f/u BAL and sputum cultures
 negative as of [**11-22**]
   .
   # Ileus: Concern for toxic megacolon, patient to CT abdomen and surgery
   consulted.  CT abdomen c/w illeus w/out evidence of colitis. Completed
   vanco course for c.diff.  Resolved having BMs, belly no longer
   distended on exam.
   - NG tube in place
   - limit fentanyl to prn, control agitation with seroquel
   .
   # Gout: Positive arthrocentesis. Renally dosed allopurinol and
   colchicine. Will continue colchicine for 2 weeks. Continue to bolus IV
   fluids.
   - renally dosed allopurinol
   - renally dosed colchicine for two weeks total until [**11-30**]
   .
   # Agitation: Largely resolved and now close to baseline. On seroquel
   and methadone for agitation, pain. EKG with prolonged QTc, thus needs
   to be followed regularly while on seroquel. Specified in dc summary
   that seroquel and methadone should be weaned.
   - methadone 10mg q6h po
   - seroquel 150mg pot id, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Cr slowly improving with hydration and renally
   dosed medications. Continue to monitor.
   -renally dose medications
   -trend Cr
   -monitor UOP
   # Elevated Transaminases
 slight bump in LFTs, resolving.
   -possibly due to seroquel
 will continue to monitor
 goal is to
   eventually wean seroquel and stop when pt
s mental status clears more
   .
   # DM: ISS with standing glargine.
   - Continue current insulin regimen.
   .
   # Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: MI in [**2129**] [**1-14**] cocaine abuse. Started on
   carvedilol yesterday with good hemodynamic response. Was on diovan but
   for time being will hold off on restarting as there are episodes of HR
   dipping to 50s and low SBPs.
   -carvediolol
   #Hypernatremia
 up to 148 -> now trending downward to 146
   - cont free water boluses with tube feeds
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: well controlled on carvedilol, rates 60s to 90s.
   - not an anticoagulation candidate due to repeat bleeds.
   .
   FEN:  start TF with free water bolus for hypernatremia, multivitamin.
   .
   PPX: Heparin subQ, ranitidine, bowel regimen.
