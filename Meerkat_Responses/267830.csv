   Assessment and Plan
   83yo gentleman with T3 rectal carcinoma transferred to the ICU after
   significant operative blood loss during lap [**3-28**].
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   -          Hct has been drifting down from 34 overnight, so unclear if
   bleed has truly stopped
   -          Follow Q4H Hct during day and transfuse for threshold of <
   30 given extensive h/o CAD
   -          If bleed clearly stabilizes and pt has no evidence of
   cardiac ischemia, would consider decreasing transfusion threshold
   tomorrow
   -          No evidence of coagulopathy
   -          Maintain active T+S
   # Respiratory failure:
   Pt not extubated after surgery out of concern for volume overload in
   setting of aggressive PRBC transfusions.
   -          CXR with evidence of volume overload, RSBI marginal
   -          Will diurese today and follow respiratory status with serial
   ABGs
   -          RSBI in AM
   # Hypotension:
   -          most likely due to propofol
   -          switch sedation to versed with boluses of fentanyl for pain
   control
   -          wean neosynephrine as tolerated
   # Volume status:
   Patient very positive in setting of fluid and RBC resuscitation after
   surgery yesterday.  Evidence of fluid overload on CXR.
   -          lasix for goal of negative 1-2L today
   -          possible that despite volume overload on CXR, patient is
   intravascularly dry.  Monitor hemodynamic status and urine output with
   lasix and reevaluate volume status in PM
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER):
   -          s/p surgery [**2-9**]
   -          continue management with surgery/oncology
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   -          control with insulin gtt for goal blood sugar 80-120
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   -          given h/o CAD, would check EKG and cardiac enzymes for
   evidence of myocardial ischemia secondary to significant bleed
   yesterday
   -          consider restarting ASA and plavix in afternoon if Hct
   stable
 OLIGURIA WITH .H/O PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY, BENIGN (BPH)
   -          patient is oliguric, most likely from poor forward flow in
   setting of volume overload
   -          diuresis with lasix as above
   -          Foley in place; of note, patient chronically straight cath

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of T3 rectal carcinoma, who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing significant operative blood loss during surgery for his rectal cancer. He has anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding). The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been drifting down since admission, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion. The plan is to follow the Hct levels closely and transfuse if they fall below 30, considering his extensive history of coronary artery disease (CAD). No evidence of coagulopathy was found.

The patient also has respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload, as evidenced by the chest X-ray (CXR) and marginal respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). Diuretics will be used to manage this condition. Hypotension is likely caused by propofol, so the sedation will be switched to versed with boluses of fentanyl for pain control. Neosynephrine will be weaned as tolerated.

The patient's volume status is positive, indicating fluid overload on the CXR. Lasix will be administered to achieve negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters today. There is a possibility that despite the apparent volume overload on the CXR, the patient may be intravascularly dry, so hemodynamic status and urine output will be monitored with lasix and reevaluated in the afternoon.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of anemia. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), specifically colorectal cancer. He also has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).

The patient underwent surgery and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.8°C, heart rate (HR) of 85 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 99/57 mmHg to 176/75 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated on propofol.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient has a marginal urine output of about 30cc/hr. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, with a total fluid intake of 12,748 mL and a total fluid output of 4,288 mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 95%, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 94.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated, following commands. He has a left internal jugular (IJ) line in place, with a somewhat bloody dressing. His lungs have good air entry bilaterally, without crackles appreciated. His abdomen is soft with an ostomy bag in place, showing small amounts of bloody drainage. The patient has a joint protection (JP) drain that drained 200cc serous drainage overnight. His extremities show no edema, and he has a left foot with a great toe amputation, with an incision somewhat erythematous, digital pulses (DP) palpable.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 6.8 to 6.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) level decreasing from 34.3% to 30.6%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 202 to 180 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) level ranging from 1.1 to 1.2 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level ranging from 21 to 23 mmol/L, and blood glucose level ranging from 176 to 67 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of cancer, diabetes, coronary artery disease, anemia secondary to blood loss, peripheral vascular disease, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. The patient was admitted to the ICU for ongoing management of his medical conditions and postoperative care after undergoing surgery.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/70 mmHg to 90/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. The patient's sedation level is adequate, and he responds to verbal stimuli.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 452 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating ongoing fluid losses. The patient's urine output has been good, with a total output of 1624 mL since admission. The patient's blood products transfused yesterday have helped in improving his hemoglobin levels.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and increased platelet count. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function are within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal residual left basal consolidation and pleural effusion, along with mild right basal atelectasis and small pleural effusion. There are no significant changes from the previous radiograph.

The patient's microbiology report indicates no growth in the urine culture."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of T3 rectal carcinoma who was transferred to the ICU after significant operative blood loss during laparotomy. The patient has been receiving blood transfusions and lasix to manage anemia and fluid overload. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, and there are concerns about volume overload. The patient's hypotension is improving, but he has renal failure with elevated creatinine levels. He also has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam, insulin, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for volume overload, as indicated by the presence of pleural effusion on chest radiograph. The RSBI value is 68, which suggests the possibility of extubation. However, close monitoring and further assessment are required before making any decisions regarding extubation.

2. Anemia: The patient has received multiple blood transfusions due to significant operative blood loss. Close monitoring of hematocrit (HCT) levels is necessary to guide further transfusion requirements. The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating ongoing anemia.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, suggesting"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of T3 rectal carcinoma who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing significant operative blood loss during surgery for rectal cancer. He has been receiving transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient is currently sedated and intubated on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His blood pressure has improved, but he remains at risk for volume overload. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been drifting down, so he was transfused with 1 unit of PRBCs. His heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg, indicating adequate intravascular volume. The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. He also has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct has been drifting down, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate compensation for blood loss. Close monitoring of Hct levels and timely transfusion of PRBCs is necessary to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is not extubated after surgery due to concerns about volume overload. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, admitted for rectal cancer surgery. He underwent extensive blood loss during the operation and required aggressive volume resuscitation with packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, but is doing well on the ventilator with appropriate oxygenation and ventilation. Diuretics were administered today, resulting in a negative fluid balance. The possibility of extubation later today is being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be attributed to volume overload after the transfusions. However, he is currently stable on the ventilator with proper oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of his respiratory status will be necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's recent diuresis and history of aggressive volume resuscitation may contribute to the development of AKI. Monitoring kidney function through laboratory tests and adjusting fluid management accordingly is crucial to prevent worsening kidney injury.
3. Infection: Prolonged intubation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Implementing measures such as head-of-bed elevation, daily wake-up rounds, and regular mouth care can help reduce this risk.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical limb ischemia increase the patient's risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and colon cancer, who was admitted for rectal cancer surgery. He underwent an extensive blood loss during the operation and required aggressive volume resuscitation with packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. His oxygenation and ventilation parameters are within acceptable limits.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/50 mmHg to 128/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and a SpO2 level of 97%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide any history.

The patient has a history of allergies to augmentin and penicillins, resulting in a rash and hives. He received 10 mg of IV lasix, which resulted in a negative fluid balance of 500 cc.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL and an elevated white blood cell count of 164 K/uL. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but his creatinine levels have increased from 1.1 to 1.4 mg/dL, suggesting acute renal failure. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low sodium (Na+), potassium ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted for rectal cancer. He underwent surgery and experienced significant blood loss, leading to acute respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient was intubated due to concerns about volume overload following transfusions. He is currently receiving aggressive volume resuscitation and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation while on the ventilator.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which could progress if renal function does not improve. This may lead to further fluid management issues and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Anemia: Due to blood loss during surgery, the patient has anemia. If not appropriately managed, it may result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and further compromise tissue perfusion.
4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored to maintain tight glycemic control postoperatively.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's cardiac enzymes were negative post-operatively, but there is still a risk of ischemic heart disease exacerbation due to his CAD history.
6. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has a history of critical limb ischemia, which increases the risk of complications such as limb loss or poor"

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo gentleman with rectal carcinoma admitted for respiratory failure
   in the setting of volume resuscitation for intraoperative blood loss.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Most likely from volume overload in patient with compromised cardiac
   function.
   -          monitor closely after extubation
   -          would diurese with IV lasix

   on his own level of a house; daughter lives in same building and
   prepares food/does bills.  Patient is able to bathe and dress himself.
   He is always oriented to person, place, time.
   -          ? effect of sedating medications
   -          Also possible that patient could have had watershed infarcts
   in setting of intraoperative bleed; however, would expect more
   localizing neuro symptoms
   -          Monitor off of sedation
   -          Restraints to prevent falls or removal of tubes/IVs
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER)
   - defer management to surgery/oncology
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   -          change to subcutaneous insulin given extremely low doses
   required on insulin gtt
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   -          would restart ASA at 81 (takes 325 at home)
   -          patient is unable to take Pos currently; will consider NG
   tube in AM
   -          hold plavix for now
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):
   -          Hct stabilized
 .H/O PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY, BENIGN (BPH)
   -          continue Foley given patient straight-cath
s himself at home
   -          oliguria resolved
   # LLL consolidation
   -          no fevers or leukocytosis to suggest infection
   -          monitor for now; defer antibiotics
   # Recent foot injury:
   -          per patient
s daughter, he was on cipro [**2-7**] b/c of stepping
   on glass at home
   -          no evidence of infection on exam
   -          discussed with surgery, no indication for antibiotics at

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cancer, diabetes, coronary artery disease, anemia, peripheral vascular disease, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to blood loss and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including Lasix for diuretic effect, PSV and SBT with good ABGs, prophylactic heparin, and midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate between 69-89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/46 to 132/121 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of bloody/brown liquid output from the ostomy site.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging shows left lower lobe consolidation and small bilateral pleural effusions.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's main concerns include cancer, diabetes, coronary artery disease, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, peripheral vascular disease, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control with insulin, and various lines for monitoring and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of rectal cancer who underwent surgery and was admitted for postoperative monitoring due to significant blood loss and aggressive fluid resuscitation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been extubated.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-145/46-121 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucus membranes, crackles at the right lung base, bronchial breath sounds at the left lung base, wheezes in both inspiration and expiration, and an abdominal distention. Neurological assessment indicates that the patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli but movement, tone, and strength assessments are not performed.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 165 K/uL, and elevated blood glucose levels. Imaging shows left lower lobe consolidation and mild interstitial edema on chest X-ray.

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to volume overload, acute renal failure with improving creatinine levels, ongoing concern for cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, anemia secondary to blood loss,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of rectal cancer, postoperative admission for monitoring due to significant blood loss and aggressive fluid resuscitation. The patient has been extubated and is doing well. There is a concern for volume overload given the transfusions, but the patient's fluid balance appears to be improving. The patient also has acute renal failure, stable hematocrit indicating acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and a history of peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial respiratory failure may recur if there is a worsening of the left lower lobe consolidation or if the patient develops new lung issues.
2. Volume overload: Given the significant fluid resuscitation and transfusions, there is a concern for volume overload. Monitoring the patient's fluid balance and adjusting fluid intake and output accordingly is essential to prevent fluid overload.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure renal function does not deteriorate further.
4. Infection: The presence of left lower lobe consolidation raises concerns about potential infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy if needed is important.
5. Bleeding: The patient's stable hematocrit indicates that the acute blood loss has been managed. However, ongoing monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of rectal cancer who was admitted for postoperative monitoring due to significant blood loss during surgery. The patient underwent aggressive fluid resuscitation and was initially on mechanical ventilation but has now been successfully extubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is following commands. However, there are some concerns regarding potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern for volume overload given the transfusions received. The left lower lobe consolidation is also concerning, but since the patient is afebrile without leukocytosis, no immediate action has been taken.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had signs of acute renal failure, but his creatinine levels have improved today. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's renal function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of rectal cancer who underwent surgery (date) and experienced significant blood loss during the operation, leading to his transfer to the ICU for aggressive volume resuscitation. The patient has since been extubated and is doing well. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.4, altered mental status that is improving, diabetes mellitus type II managed with sliding scale insulin, coronary artery disease with ischemic heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The patient also has benign prostatic hypertrophy.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/67 to 151/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure is -1 mmHg, indicating possible fluid overload. 

The patient's blood product usage has been significant, with a total output of 2,130 mL. The patient has received infusions of heparin sodium, furosemide, metoprolol, and other medications for prophylaxis and treatment of various conditions. 

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, leukocytosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of rectal cancer who underwent surgery and experienced significant blood loss, leading to acute anemia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient has been extubated and is showing improvement in mental status. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 142/67 mmHg to 151/94 mmHg, heart rate between 100-113 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's blood work shows anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and elevated white blood cell count of 207 K/uL. The patient's creatinine levels are within the low-mid 1's, indicating possible pre-existing kidney dysfunction. The patient has stable HCT levels, suggesting that the anemia is due to blood loss.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male who underwent surgery for T3 rectal carcinoma and experienced significant blood loss of approximately 2.5 liters. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and presents with several medical complications.

1. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels in his blood, which requires careful correction to prevent complications such as central pontine myelinolysis.

2. Mental status changes: The patient is disoriented and has altered mental status, which could be due to sedating medications or the hospital environment. It is important to discuss this with the patient and his family and consider chemical or physical restraints if necessary.

3. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's blood sugar levels have been fluctuating, ranging from the 90s to low 100s, but were up to 200 this morning. His insulin requirement will need to be increased, especially with the administration of D5 (5% dextrose) solution.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient is currently on aspirin (ASA) at 81 mg and Plavix, both of which will need to be discussed with the surgical team. The patient should continue on a beta-blocker and transition to a oral dose.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. His hematocrit (Hct) has stabilized after transfusion.

6. Peripheral vascular disease (P"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of rectal cancer admitted to the ICU after undergoing a low anterior resection (LAR) procedure with an estimated blood loss of 2.5L. The patient's chief complaints are blood loss and respiratory failure. He has a known allergy to augmentin and penicillins, resulting in a rash and hives. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, metoprolol, and other ICU medications. 

24-hour events include the removal of an arterial line, the patient remaining confused, and the family requesting vascular surgery to be informed about the patient's condition. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/79 mmHg to 157/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's weight is currently 76.9 kg, and his height is 62 inches. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 120 mL of total fluids and an output of 2,665 mL of blood products, 2,580 mL of urine, and 65 mL of NG drainage. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake, oriented to place and person, talkative, and"

","The patient is an 83-year-old man who underwent surgery for colon cancer. He is currently in the ICU and has shown significant improvement. The patient's mental status is good, and he is fully oriented. However, his orientation can sometimes be inconsistent, which is consistent with delirium.

The patient has several medical conditions including cancer (malignant neoplasm of the colon), hypernatremia (high sodium), diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease (CAD), anemia due to blood loss, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/79 mmHg to 157/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg, and he has received a total of 120 mL of fluids over 24 hours. The patient has lost 2,545 mL of fluids through various routes.

The patient is on multiple medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and insulin for his diabetes. His laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte levels. However, his creatinine and blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of colon cancer. The patient has several medical conditions including hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, anemia due to blood loss, peripheral vascular disease, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/79 mmHg to 157/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's fluid balance shows an overall negative balance of -2,545 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen with ostomy intact, trace edema in both extremities, and normal neurologic assessment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and the presence of an arterial line may indicate a risk of infection.
2. Bleeding: The"
