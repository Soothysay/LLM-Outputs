","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive enterococcus. The patient presents with fevers and lethargy from a rehabilitation facility.

The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, which is not delirium, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He has a history of an epidural abscess and bacteremia. Neurosurgery has been consulted and recommends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for recurrence of the abscess.

The patient also has aortic vegetation seen on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) during the last admission, which may have progressed to an abscess. A repeat echo will be ordered for evaluation. Other possibilities include meningitis given altered mental status and abscess formation in the brain from previously known septic emboli.

The patient's chest X-ray shows increasing right lower lobe infiltrate concerning for pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis. It is important to follow imaging to confirm whether it is pneumonia or pneumonitis.

The patient has a urinary tract infection with no pyuria but positive bacteria and many yeast. The urinary catheter was changed in the emergency department.

The plan includes continuing vancomycin and aztreonam, sending cultures, and repeating the echo in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and increased work of breathing. An MRI showed worsened mitral regurgitation and poor visualization of the aortic valve. The patient also has a possible ongoing discitis/osteomyelitis. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with increased opacification on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on non-rebreather mask and receiving infusions of morphine and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infective Endocarditis: The presence of fever, worsening mitral regurgitation, and poor visualization of the aortic valve on echo raises concerns for infective endocarditis. Ongoing discitis/osteomyelitis could also be related to this condition.

2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient's initial presentation with sepsis without organ dysfunction has now progressed to potential complications that may involve organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Respiratory Failure: The significant interval progression of right lower lobe opacification on chest X-ray suggests worsening respiratory status. The patient's increased work of breathing, tachycardia, and need for non-rebreather mask indicate a potential respiratory failure. Continuous"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation facility for fevers and lethargy. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including:

1. Fever: The patient has had persistent fevers, which may be attributed to discitis/osteomyelitis at the L5-S1 level detected on an MRI of the spine. Blood cultures also show growth of Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could be a contaminant.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient's condition has worsened, leading to increased respiratory distress. He required high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) support and non-rebreather mask (NRB) due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing (WOB). A chest X-ray revealed significant progression of right lower lobe opacification, suggesting possible aspiration pneumonia.

3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has an aortic valve vegetation that needs to be evaluated further, especially if blood cultures confirm Enterococcus bacteremia.

4. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement: The patient had an epidural abscess and bacteremia with pan-sensitive Enterococcus during a previous hospitalization. This may require ongoing monitoring and treatment.

5. Coagulation disorder: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presents to the ICU with fevers and lethargy after being hospitalized for an epidural abscess and bacteremia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently on several medications including Vanc and aztreonam for infection, morphine for pain, and metoprolol for cardiovascular support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA) or aspiration due to worsening infiltrate on chest X-ray and oxygen requirement.
2. Septic emboli in the brain potentially leading to abscess formation.
3. Aortic endocarditis, considering the patient's history of recent hospitalization and intravenous catheter use.
4. Meningitis, although less concerning given the improvement in mental status after discontinuing morphine.
5. Right atrial appendage thrombus, for which the patient is currently on coumadin.
6. Acute respiratory distress, which may represent PNA or aspiration, and needs close monitoring and weaning of oxygen as tolerated.
7. Potential complications related to chronic renal insufficiency, such as decreased glomerular filtration rate and need for contrast administration.
8. Possible conversion of septic emboli in the brain to abscess.
9. Gout flare due to medications or underlying condition.
10. Complications related to the recent epidural"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented to the hospital with fevers and lethargy after being discharged from rehabilitation for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive enterococcus. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and altered mental status. 

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient required intubation due to hypoxemia and increased work of breathing, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Fevers: Possible sources include discitis/osteomyelitis at L5-S1, as shown by an MRI of the lumbar spine, and Gram-positive cocci in clusters from blood cultures. However, the latter may be a contaminant.
3. Altered mental status (AMS): Initially thought to be due to fevers and infection, AMS may have been contributed to by morphine given in the ED. Currently, the patient's mental status is improving.
4. Right atrial appendage thrombus: The patient's INR is 2.8 today, and Coumadin will be restarted at 1 mg per day.
5. Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient developed a rash to ampicillin and ceftriaxone and was changed to Vancomycin.
6. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was hospitalized previously for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive Enterococcus. The patient presents with fevers and lethargy from a rehabilitation facility. He was intubated due to respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. Blood cultures show Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which may be a contaminant. The patient has right atrial appendage thrombus, an epidural abscess post laminectomy, and enterococcal bacteremia. His current condition includes persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, altered mental status, and fever.

Potential medical complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has difficulty oxygenating, and there is evidence of aspiration pneumonia on the chest X-ray.
2. Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient developed a rash to ampicillin and ceftriaxone and is currently being treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin.
3. Right atrial appendage thrombus: The patient has an elevated INR of 4.3, indicating a risk for bleeding. Coumadin should be held, and PT/INR should be monitored.
4. Epidural abscess: The patient had an epidural abscess previously and requires follow-up with neurosurgery recommendations.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient required invasive ventilation due to difficulty oxygenating and dyssynchronous ventilation. An arterial line was started, and blood cultures were obtained. The patient developed a fever of 103.6°F and was started on Clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia. A chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, and the patient received 40 IV Lasix twice. The patient has allergies to ampicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and altered mental status suggest the possibility of an infection leading to sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's requirement for invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate AKI.
4. Delirium: Altered mental status can be a sign of delirium, especially in critically ill patients.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation due to difficulty oxygenating and dyssynchrony with the vent. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, and altered mental status, which is not delirium. He was previously diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has been worsening, as indicated by fever, increased heart rate, and elevated blood pressure. He is also experiencing fluid overload, as shown by pulmonary edema and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures of endotracheal aspirates are necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and fluid overload can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Frequent cultures and surveillance for signs of infection are important.

   # Persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient seemed to
   aspiration yesterday, requiring intubation for hypoxemia and increased
   work of breathing. However, he has been difficult to oxygenate
   overnight.  Likely all due to aspiration pneumonia
   -keep patient on left side to get better blood flow to L lung
   -continue Vanc/Aztrenam/Clinda for aspiration pneumonia
   -diurese with lasix as BP tolerates
   .
   # Fevers:  Several sources possible.  MRI of Lspine done yesterday
   shows L5-S1 discitis/osteo which could be the reason for his continued
   fevers.  Blood cultures from yesterday also growing Gram +cocci in
   clusters which may be a contaminant as it seems to be from one bottle.
   We will have to await speciation.  CXR also showing RLL consolidation
   which may be [**1-17**] to aspiration which occurred in ED here.   If blood
   cultures are + for Enterococcus then will need to perform TEE to
   evaluate for worsening aortic vegetation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was recently hospitalized for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive enterococcus. The patient presents with fevers, lethargy, and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. There are multiple potential sources of infection including aspiration pneumonia, discitis/osteomyelitis of L5-S1, and possible enterococcal bacteremia. The patient has altered mental status likely due to fevers and infection, but no evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarction on CT head. The patient's blood cultures from yesterday show growth of gram-positive cocci in clusters, which may be a contaminant. The patient's condition is unstable with difficulty oxygenating and dyssynchronous ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure has progressed to the point of requiring intubation. The difficulty in oxygenating suggests ongoing compromise of the respiratory system.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event in the ED may have led to aspiration pneumonia, which is evident on the chest X-ray and contributing to his respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The presence of fevers, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures indicate a systemic infection, likely sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic renal insufficiency, and previous hospitalization for epidural abscess and bacteremia. He presents from a rehabilitation facility with fevers and lethargy. He was admitted with sepsis without organ dysfunction, but now has developed respiratory failure, altered mental status, and right atrial appendage thrombus. He also has an epidural abscess, enterococcal bacteremia, asthma, gout, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress if he continues to have difficulty oxygenating and if aspiration pneumonia worsens.
2. Fevers: The patient's fevers could be due to various sources such as the L5-S1 discitis/osteo, possible contaminant in blood cultures, or aspiration pneumonia. It is important to determine the cause of the fevers to guide further treatment.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to infection, morphine administration in the ED, or other underlying causes. Monitoring his mental status and ensuring proper pain management is essential.
4. Right Atrial Appendage Thrombus: The patient has a right atrial appendage thrombus, which increases the risk of stroke. Restarting Coumadin therapy is necessary to reduce this risk, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male with h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital
   course including epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus
   bactermia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, NSTEMI, RA
   thrombus, and temporary HD for gadolinium exposure -- d/c'ed to rehab
   on ampicillin and CTX x 6 weeks.  Developed drug rash at rehab and
   switched to daptomycin and then started developing fevers, lethargy and
   AMS. Trasferred here for further management.  Noted to have worsening
   RLL infiltrate and witnessed aspiration event requiring mechanical
   ventilation.
   #Acute respiratory distress: Likely [**1-17**] PNA and aspiration with h/o
   asthma.  Intubated [**10-20**] for worsening respiratory distress in setting
   of witnessed aspiration.   Also with some volume overload.
   - On antibiotics to cover HAP and aspiration
   - Uncomfortable on vent
 will try increasing sedation and possibly
   swtiching to propofol or paralysis if not settling out
   - Borderline oxygenation, but does not meed ARDS criteia (L lung
   relatively spared).
   - Diuresis
   - Wean PEEP as tolerated given lack of ARDS physiology and concerns
   that high PEEP will overdistend good lung.  Can consider double lumen
   tube if necessary.
   # Fevers:  Likely due to R-sided pneumonia.  Also osteomyelitis and
   discitis may be contributing.  Positive blood culture may be a
   contaminant.
   - Copntinue vanc and aztreonam per ID, added clinda for anaerobic
   coverage
   - F/U urine legionella
   - F/U cultures and GPCC speciation (if enterococcus, would treat for
   another 6 weeks for endocarditis)
   - Continue vanc for enterococcus endocarditis
   - F/U neurosurgery recs
   - F/U ID recs
   - TEE requested by consult service
   # Right Atrial Appendage Thrombus:  Started on coumadin during last
   hospitalization.
   - Holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR

   course from Enterococcal aoV endocarditis, left atrial clot, epidural
   abscess, readmitted with fevers and respiratory distress from
   aspiration vs. PNA. Intubated yesterday for acutely worsening distress
   developing immediately after witnessed aspiration. This afternoon, he
   developed rapid afib with hypotension, now on neo and amio infusion.

   CXR shows progressing of infiltrates- very impressive unilateral
   process.
   Imp: 76 yo male with fevers, acute respiratory failure from aspiration,
   afib, shock.  With blood cultures so far negative and Lspine MRI
   negative for recurrent abscess, lung appears to be the only
   identifiable source so far.
   On abx for HAP, PC ventilation, amiodarone, neo infusion. Given
   strongly unilateral process, would position pt left side down to
   increase blood flow to more functional lung. Some concern in this
   context that PEEP could be over-distending his normal lung- did not
   tolerate attempt to drop earlier this afternoon, but several vent
   changes made and pt then in rapid afib. Will continue amio for rate
   control, neo infusion to maintain MAP>60.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 80 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, NSTEMI, RA thrombus, and temporary HD for gadolinium exposure. The patient was initially admitted to rehab and later transferred to the ICU due to worsening respiratory distress, fevers, lethargy, and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress likely due to pneumonia (PNA) and aspiration with a history of asthma. He is intubated for worsening respiratory distress in the setting of witnessed aspiration. Antibiotics have been started to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration.

The patient also has fevers, likely due to right-sided pneumonia. Osteomyelitis and discitis may also be contributing to the fevers. Positive blood culture may be a contaminant. Antibiotics have been continued per ID recommendations, and anaerobic coverage has been added.

Additionally, the patient has a right atrial appendage thrombus, for which he was started on Coumadin during the last hospitalization. However, due to a supratherapeutic INR, Coumadin has been held.

The patient is critically ill and requires careful monitoring and management. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further episodes of aspiration, development of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history including asthma, gout, recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, NSTEMI, RA thrombus, and temporary HD for gadolinium exposure. The patient was previously discharged to rehab and developed drug rash, leading to a switch in antibiotics. Subsequently, the patient developed fevers, lethargy, and altered mental status, resulting in transfer to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Acute respiratory distress: The patient likely has pneumonia (PNA) and aspiration with a history of asthma. Intubation was performed on October 20th for worsening respiratory distress following a witnessed aspiration event. The patient also has some volume overload.
- Antibiotics have been started to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration.
- The patient is uncomfortable on the ventilator, and increasing sedation or switching to propofol or paralysis may be considered if not settling out.
- Borderline oxygenation is observed, but the patient does not meet ARDS criteria. The relatively spared lung suggests that weaning PEEP as tolerated should be considered due to concerns about overdistending the good lung. A double-lumen tube may be necessary if required.
- Diuretics may also be considered.

   bactermia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, NSTEMI, RA
   thrombus, and temporary HD for gadolinium exposure -- d/c'ed to rehab
   on ampicillin and CTX x 6 weeks.  Developed drug rash at rehab and
   switched to daptomycin and then started developing fevers, lethargy and
   AMS. Trasferred here for further management.  Noted to have worsening
   RLL infiltrate and witnessed aspiration event requiring mechanical
   ventilation.
   #Acute respiratory distress: Likely [**1-17**] PNA and aspiration with h/o
   asthma.  Intubated [**10-20**] for worsening respiratory distress in setting
   of witnessed aspiration.   Also with some volume overload.
   - On antibiotics to cover HAP and aspiration
   - Uncomfortable on vent
 will try increasing sedation and possibly
   swtiching to propofol or paralysis if not settling out
   - Borderline oxygenation, but does not meed ARDS criteia (L lung
   relatively spared).
   - Diuresis
   # Fevers:  Likely due to R-sided pneumonia.  Also osteomyelitis and
   discitis may be contributing.  Positive blood culture may be a
   contaminant.
   - Copntinue vanc and aztreonam per ID, added clinda for anaerobic
   coverage

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, NSTEMI, RA thrombus, and temporary HD for gadolinium exposure. He was discharged to rehab on ampicillin and CTX for 6 weeks but developed drug rash and switched to daptomycin. He then started developing fevers, lethargy, and altered mental status. He was transferred here for further management. The patient has worsening right lower lobe infiltrate and witnessed aspiration event requiring mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient is likely experiencing pneumonia and aspiration with a history of asthma. He required intubation for worsening respiratory distress due to witnessed aspiration. There may be some volume overload as well.
- Treatment: The patient is on antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration. Sedation may be increased, and possibly switching to propofol or paralysis if not settling out. Diuresis is also recommended.
2. Fevers: The patient's fevers are likely due to right-sided pneumonia. Osteomyelitis and discitis may also be contributing factors. Positive blood culture may be a contaminant.
- Treatment: Continue vancomycin and aztreonam per ID. Add clindamycin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, NSTEMI, RA thrombus, and temporary HD for gadolinium exposure. He was discharged to rehab on ampicillin and CTX for 6 weeks but developed drug rash and switched to daptomycin. He then started developing fevers, lethargy, and altered mental status. He was transferred here for further management and has worsening right lower lobe infiltrate and GPCC bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: Likely due to right lower lobe pneumonia. Osteomyelitis and discitis may also be contributing. Positive blood culture may be a contaminant.
2. Acute respiratory distress: Likely community-acquired pneumonia with a history of asthma. On antibiotics to cover HCAp. Supportive care with supplemental oxygen and nebs. Check ABG given high oxygen requirement, slightly somnolent state this morning. May need intubation if worsens.
3. Pain: Altered on morphine. Has been poorly controlled at baseline. Try non-narcotic regimen. Consider pain consult if not controlled with above measures.
4. Right Atrial Appendage Thrombus: Started on coumadin during last hospitalization. Restart coumadin."

   course including epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus
   bactermia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, NSTEMI, RA
   thrombus, and temporary HD for gadolinium exposure -- d/c'ed to rehab
   on ampicillin and CTX x 6 weeks.  Developed drug rash at rehab and
   switched to daptomycin and then started developing fevers, lethargy and
   AMS. Trasferred here for further management.  Noted to have worsening
   RLL infiltrate and witnessed aspiration event requiring mechanical
   ventilation.
   # Fevers:  Likely due to RLL pneumonia.  Also osteomyelitis and
   discitis may be contributing.  Positive blood culture may be a
   contaminant.
   - Copntinue vanc and aztreonam per ID
   - F/U final read of L-spine MR
   - F/U cultures and GPCC speciation (if enterococcus, would treat for
   another 6 weeks for endocarditis)
   - Continue vanc for enterococcus endocarditis
   #Acute respiratory distress: Likely [**1-17**] PNA with h/o asthma.
   - On antibiotics to cover HCAp
   -supportive care with supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - Check ABG given high oxygen requirement, slightly somnolent state
   this morning
   - Keep NPO until trajectory of pt
s respiratory status becomes clearer-
   may need intubation if worsens
   # Pain: Altered on morphine.  Has been poorly controlled at baseline.
   - Try non-narcotic regimen.
   - Consider pain consult if not controlled with abovel.
   # Right Atrial Appendage Thrombus:  Started on coumadin during last

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including asthma, gout, recent hospitalizations, and multiple comorbidities such as an epidural abscess, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, NSTEMI, RA thrombus, and temporary hemodialysis. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility where he developed a drug rash and was switched to daptomycin. However, he began developing fevers, lethargy, and altered mental status, leading to his transfer to the ICU.

On arrival in the ICU, the patient required intubation due to worsening respiratory failure and a witnessed aspiration event. He has been placed on mechanical ventilation with PCV+assist mode. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and an elevated temperature. He is also experiencing right lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging reveals worsening right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Fevers: Likely due to right lower lobe pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and discitis. Positive blood culture may be a contaminant.
- Continue vancomycin and aztreonam per ID.
- Follow"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status and respiratory failure. Upon admission, the patient was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and became hypotensive. A central venous line (CVL) was placed, and the patient was started on neostigmine (Neo) and amiodarone. The patient eventually converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR), and Neo was weaned to 0.5 mcg/kg. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned for Monday.

The patient has a history of discitis, which has not progressed since the last MRI. There is also a small fluid collection not in the epidural space, possibly an abscess. The patient experienced hypoxemia during hypotension yesterday and required a change from assist control (AC) to airway pressure release ventilation (APRV).

Allergies include ampicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient received vancomycin at 2146-10-21 07:35 PM, aztreonam at 2146-10-22 12:00 AM, and clindamycin at 2146-10-22 12:00 AM. Infusions include midazolam (Versed) at 1 mg/hour, fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour, phenylephrine at 0.5 mcg/Kg/min, and amiodarone at 0.5 mg/min. Other ICU medications include metop"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive enterococcus. The patient presents from a rehabilitation facility with fevers and lethargy.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient developed atrial fibrillation, which was initially uncontrolled but converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) in the early evening. The patient is currently on amiodarone for AFib.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension during the atrial fibrillation episode, which led to the placement of a central venous line (CVL) and the initiation of norepinephrine (Neo) and amiodarone. The patient's blood pressures have improved since then, and Neo is being weaned.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to hypoxemia and increased work of breathing, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on assisted ventilation mode APRV (Airway Pressure Release Ventilation) with an endotracheal tube. Daily chest X-rays will be performed to monitor the progression of pneumonia.

4. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which may be due to several sources including L5-S1 discitis/osteomyelitis"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) who presented to the hospital for fevers and lethargy. The patient is currently in the ICU due to an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by Pan-Sensitive Enterococcus. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has worsening right lung pneumonia, which involves the entire lung field on chest X-ray. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned as tolerated. The antibiotics Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Clindamycin have been started but with minimal improvement. It is recommended to keep the patient on the left side to improve blood flow to the left lung, continue the current antibiotics, and consider daily chest X-rays.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR that caused hypotension and required a central venous line placement and nebulization with Neo. The patient was started on amiodarone and successfully converted to sinus rhythm (NSR). It is recommended to monitor the patient on telemetry, continue amiodarone, wean Neo as tolerated, and plan for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

   note,including assessment and plan. I would add: 76 yo male with gout,
   asthma, recent complicated hospitalization for enterococcal aortic
   valve endocarditis, epidural abscess, atrial thrombus on coumadin,
   admitted with recurrent fevers. In the ICU he developed worsening
   respiratory distress with witnessed aspiration resulting in
   intubation/mechanical ventilation. Yesterday, he developed afib and
   shock,- on amiodarone/neo infusion. Converted to NSR overnight.
   Plans:
   1.       Acute respiratory failure- has Aspiration/PNA with MRSA
   recovered from sputums ((+) cultures last hospitalization, then felt to
   be a contaminant)- on Vanco. Ventilator requirements have been
   difficult given process almost exlucisvely involves the right side.
   Previously dyssynchronous on AC, transiently on PC ventilation.
   Attempts to decrease PEEP (due to concern of overdistending normal
   lung) resulted in hypoxia, desaturations do respond to recruitment
   maneuvers. Now on APRV and tolerating reasonably. Keep left side down.
   2.       elevated transaminases: shock liver most likely in his
   scenario, will follow  LFT
s and consider abd US if it does not improve
   3.       Fevers: Blood culture previously reported as GPC returned
   NEGative as final result, LS MRI negative for progression and only
   positive culture S.aureus from sputum
mostly pointing toward lung as
   primary source. Abx are Vanc/aztreonam to cover PNA/enterococcal

The patient was previously hospitalized and discharged to rehabilitation on ampicillin and ceftriaxone. However, the patient developed a rash attributed to medication and was switched to daptomycin. The patient then developed fevers, lethargy, and altered mental status, leading to intubation after a witnessed aspiration event. The patient now presents with a dense right-sided infiltrate.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumonia (PNA) with large right-sided infiltrate, and hypoTN (hypotension) requiring vasopressor (neo) support. The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac biomarkers, elevated INR, and acute transaminitis. The patient also has elevated lactic acid levels and an elevated LDH.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress, which may worsen due to the dense right-sided infiltrate seen on the chest X-ray. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He was discharged to rehab but developed a rash attributed to medication and switched to daptomycin. He then developed fevers, lethargy, and altered mental status, leading to intubation after a witnessed aspiration event. The patient now has a dense right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (APRV) due to aspiration pneumonia with dense right-sided infiltrate. Weaning FiO2 to maintain PaO2 > 65 is recommended.
2. Hypotension on vasopressor (neo): The patient's low blood pressure may be due to early sepsis (e.g., pneumonia) or heart failure (BNP 10,000). Further fluid challenge or diuresis is pending the response to this challenge.
3. Persistent hypotension: Despite being on vancomycin and aztreonam, the patient's blood pressure remains low, and his condition appears to be worsening. Sending sputum cultures and vancomycin levels is advised. Broadening antibiotic coverage should be discussed with infectious disease specialists.
4. Atrial fibrillation"

   I saw and examined the pt, and was physically present with the ICU team
   for the key portions of services provided. I agree with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 284**]
   note,including assessment and plan. I would add: 76 yo male with gout,
   asthma, recent complicated hospitalization for enterococcal aortic
   valve endocarditis, epidural abscess, atrial thrombus on coumadin,
   admitted with recurrent fevers. In the ICU he developed worsening
   respiratory distress with witnessed aspiration resulting in
   intubation/mechanical ventilation. Yesterday, he developed afib and
   shock,- on amiodarone/neo infusion. Converted to NSR overnight.
   Plans:
   1.       Acute respiratory failure- has Aspiration/PNA with MRSA
   recovered from sputums ((+) cultures last hospitalization, then felt to
   be a contaminant)- on Vanco. Ventilator requirements have been
   difficult given process almost exlucisvely involves the right side.
   Previously dyssynchronous on AC, transiently on PC ventilation.
   Attempts to decrease PEEP (due to concern of overdistending normal
   lung) resulted in hypoxia, desaturations do respond to recruitment
   maneuvers. Now on APRV and tolerating reasonably. Keep left side down.
   2.       elevated transaminases: shock liver most likely in his
   scenario, will follow  LFT
s and consider abd US if it does not improve
   3.       Fevers: Blood culture previously reported as GPC returned
   NEGative as final result, LS MRI negative for progression and only
   positive culture S.aureus from sputum
mostly pointing toward lung as
   primary source. Abx are Vanc/aztreonam to cover PNA/enterococcal
   endocaridtis- will touch base with ID re abx

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospitalization for enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis, epidural abscess, and atrial thrombus on coumadin. He was admitted with recurrent fevers and developed worsening respiratory distress with witnessed aspiration, resulting in intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient also has atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone and neo infusion. His current condition includes acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia with MRSA recovered from sputum cultures, elevated transaminases likely due to shock liver, and fevers with no identified source. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and aspiration event have resulted in the need for mechanical ventilation. The dense right-sided infiltrate suggests a possible pneumonia, which may be caused by MRSA as indicated by the sputum culture.
2. Hypotension (hypoTN): The patient is on vasopressor support, indicating low blood pressure. The etiology of hypoTN includes early sepsis from PNA and heart failure, as evidenced by a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 10,000.
3. Acute transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) have significantly increased, suggesting acute liver injury. This could be due to shock liver in the setting of hypoTN and atrial fibrillation.
4. Elevated cardiac biomarkers: The patient's troponin T level is elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury. This may be related to recent episodes of NSTEMI or other cardiac events.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 5.9, likely due to coumadin therapy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Fluid collection: A new small fluid collection of uncertain significance was noted on repeat spine MRI. Further evaluation is needed to determine its nature and significance.
7. Fever: The patient had recurrent fevers initially, but is now afebrile. Further investigation is required to identify the source of infection and guide antibiotic therapy.

Overall, the patient's critical illness requires careful management of respiratory failure, cardiovascular support, hepatic function, coagulopathy, and potential sources of infection."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was recently hospitalized for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive Enterococcus. He presents with fevers and lethargy from a rehabilitation facility. 

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which was likely due to pneumonia and atrial fibrillation. His blood pressure has improved since returning to normal sinus rhythm.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB/RVR): The patient had an episode of AFIB/RVR, which required central venous pressure monitoring and neosynephrine for blood pressure support. He was started on amiodarone and successfully converted to normal sinus rhythm.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure due to worsening right lung pneumonia. He is on mechanical ventilation and will continue to be weaned as tolerated.
4. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient initially had AMS likely secondary to fevers and infection. A CT scan of the head showed no signs of acute hemorrhage or infarction. He received morphine in the emergency department, which may have contributed to AMS. Currently, it is difficult to assess his mental status due to a large amount of sedation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of sepsis, severe organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and altered mental status. He was previously diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction.

24-hour events include a positive yeast culture in the sputum, muddy brown casts indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN) likely due to hypotension, conversion to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and reloading of IV fluids. The patient's urine output has increased to 1 liter of normal saline and 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

Allergies include ampicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin.

Vital signs show a temperature of 102.8°F, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/48 to 91/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation of 92%, total in fluid balance of 4,046 mL, and total out fluid balance of 3,246 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent hospitalizations including an epidural abscess, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He presented with aspiration pneumonia with a dense right-sided infiltrate. He is currently on mechanical ventilation (APRV) and has hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia. His fever persists, and his chest X-ray shows improvement but still shows a dense opacity. Sputum culture is positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin levels are therapeutic. Antibiotic coverage includes vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin. There is also a discussion about broadening antibiotic coverage, including consideration of a fluoroquinolone versus an aminoglycoside.

The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he has received one unit of packed red blood cells without an increase in his hemoglobin level. His cardiac biomarkers are elevated, most likely due to a demand phenomenon during atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension. The patient has elevated liver enzymes, most likely due to shock liver during atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hepatic vein thrombosis is unlikely. His prothrombin time is elevated, and he has been started on war"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He is currently admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia with dense, large right-sided infiltrate. The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation (APRV) and hypoTN on vasopressor (neo). There is also evidence of early sepsis (e.g., pneumonia) versus heart failure (BNP 10,000). Additionally, the patient has persistent hypotension and worsening chest X-ray despite being on vancomycin and aztreonam for more than 2 days. Further fluid challenge or diuresis is pending the response to this challenge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation (APRV)
2. Hypotension (hypoTN) on vasopressor (neo)
3. Early sepsis (e.g., pneumonia) versus heart failure (BNP 10,000)

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. The patient presents with respiratory failure, fevers, intermittent hypoTN (hypotension), and altered mental status (AMS). He is currently intubated and on ventilatory support with APRV mode, receiving 50% FiO2. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with a dense, large right-sided infiltrate. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/50 to 160/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral rhonchi, right lower extremity edema, and warm skin. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests. 

The patient's plan includes continuing ventilatory support with weaning of FiO2 to 0.5 and further PaO2 > 65, considering a switch to PCV mode in the morning, monitoring for hypoTN, and sending sputum cultures. Broadening antibiotics may be discussed with infectious disease"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He is tolerating APRV better with improved ventilation and oxygenation.
   Secretions are minimal.  He continues to have good UO for now despite
   elevated creatinine.  We will attempt slowly diurese if BP and HR
   allow. Broad antibiotics to continue for now until culture data back.
   He may need therapeutic bronchoscopy if there is evidence for mucous
   plugging as pneumonia begins to resolve. His wife has been updated
   regarding his progress.
   Patient is critically ill

He presents with respiratory failure, fevers, intermittent hypoTN (hypotension), and altered mental status (AMS). He was intubated due to aspiration pneumonia with a dense, large right-sided infiltrate. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

24-hour events:
- Sputum culture taken at 11:28 AM on [date]
- Ultrasound performed at 03:30 PM on [date]
- Fever recorded at 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit at 08:00 PM on [date]
- Last dose of antibiotics: Vancomycin at 07:35 PM on [date], Clindamycin at 08:30 AM on [date], and Aztreonam at 09:15 AM on [date]
- Fentanyl and Midazolam infusions ongoing
- Other ICU medications administered as per the flow sheet

Vital signs:
- Temperature: Max 39.3 degrees Celsius, current 38.7 degrees Celsius
- Heart rate: 92 bpm (73-157 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 148/50 mmHg (76-160/38-85 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (12-23 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm
- Central venous pressure: 16 mmHg (12-17 mmHg)

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complications including an epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever and has shown improvement in bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. His white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and liver enzymes are elevated but trending down. The patient has elevated cardiac biomarkers, but these are most likely due to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has a history of an epidural abscess and aortic endocarditis. Repeat spine MRI showed discitis L5-S1, which shows no progression compared to the previous MRI. There is a new small fluid collection of uncertain significance. The patient's fevers are concerning, and further evaluation is needed, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess for endocarditis. The patient's care team is considering broadening antibiotic therapy if fevers persist."

   # Troponin leak:  Patient with troponin leak after episode of afib
   earlier in the week.  CK elevated slightly but MB flat.  Likely [**1-17**] to
   demand ischemia in the setting of hypotenstion, renal failure and afib
   with RVR.
   - rate control, ASA, statin on hold given tranaminitis
   # Fevers:  Persistent fevers. Does not necessarily represent failure of
   current Abx. BCx negative to date. Need TEE to rule out progession of
   endocarditis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by Pan-Sensitive Enterococcus. The patient presents with fevers and lethargy and subsequently required intubation for pneumonia of the entire right lung. 

The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The summary of the potential medical complications includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has right lung pneumonia, which seems to have slightly improved since yesterday on CXR. The patient is on airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) and will continue to wean as tolerated. Antibiotics (Vanc/Aztreonam/Clinda) will be continued, and the patient will be kept on the left side to improve blood flow to the left lung. Daily chest x-rays will be done.

2. Hypotension/sepsis: The patient likely has pneumonia-induced sepsis. The patient was previously fluid responsive but is now fluid overloaded. Diuresis will be started, and the current antibiotics will be continued. Albumin may be administered.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB/RVR): The patient had an episode of AFIB/RVR that required central venous line placement and neo for blood pressure support. Another episode occurred"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was recently hospitalized for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive enterococcus. The patient presents with fevers, lethargy, and respiratory failure due to pneumonia of the entire right lung. He was intubated and put on assisted ventilation. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin. The patient also has hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis from pneumonia. He has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and a troponin leak after an episode of atrial fibrillation earlier in the week. The patient has persistent fevers and requires further evaluation for possible endocarditis. He also has acute mental status changes and a history of an atrial appendage thrombus. The patient has developed a rash to ampicillin and ceftriaxone and has been changed to daptomycin. He has anemia and is being followed by the hematology department. The patient's medical history includes asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He is currently on multiple medications, including vancomycin, aztreonam, clindamycin, pantoprazole, furosemide, and midazolam.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of allergies to ampicillin and ceftriaxone, both causing rashes. 

The patient is currently on multiple infusions including midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour, fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour, and pantoprazole (Protonix). Additionally, the patient is receiving furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit, with a maximum temperature recorded at 39.3 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's heart rate is within normal range (82 bpm), blood pressure is stable (133/51 mmHg), respiratory rate is slightly elevated (24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is at 99%.

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in APRV mode. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 537-650 mL, respiratory rate of 3, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 20 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 99%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2 of 188, HCO3- of 24 mEq/L, and base excess of -2.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 257 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L, elevated creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count of 57 K/uL. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,763 mL and output of 1,925 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 162 mL. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 15 mmHg.

The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, hypotension (not in shock), altered mental status (not delirium), and altered nutrition. The patient is on appropriate prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's disposition is noted as full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation center for fevers and lethargy. The patient has been intubated due to pneumonia affecting his entire right lung. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin for the pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/51 mmHg to 160/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe pneumonia involving the entire right lung, which has led to respiratory failure. He is on mechanical ventilation, and efforts are being made to wean him off as tolerated.
2. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including fevers and hypotension, suggest sepsis, likely secondary to the pneumonia. He is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, indicating potential hypotension. He is currently off pressors but requires close monitoring and management.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient experienced episodes of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on ventilator support (APRV) and is likely suffering from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with dense, large right-sided infiltrate. 

The patient's other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation (Afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), acute transaminitis, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The atrial fibrillation has been resolved and the patient is no longer on neo. 

The patient has undergone several interventions, including surgery for an epidural abscess, treatment for enterococcus bacteremia, and management of aortic endocarditis. The patient also has an atrial thrombus and a history of NSTEMI. 

The patient's current medications include amio (amiodarone) for atrial fibrillation, ASA (aspirin) for cardiac protection, PPI (proton pump inhibitor) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin due to atrial thrombus. 

The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure,"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, atrial thrombus, NSTEMI) p/w
   aspiration PNA with dense, large R-sided infiltrate.
   #Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent (APRV): Likely [**1-17**] to
   HAP/aspiration PNA + pulmonary edema.
   - Cont APRV, wean FiO2 to 0.5 and further PaO2 > 65
   - Consider switching to PCV
   - Continue abx (vanc/aztreonam/clinda) for aspiration/HAP
   - Continue diuresis
   #HypoTN: [**1-17**] Afib. Now resolved and off neo. Continue to follow.  This
   is likely etiology of renal failure too.
   #Continued fevers. PNA: CXR--bilateral infiltrates improved. Vanc level
   therapeutic.
   - Cont vanc / aztreonam / clinda (check vanc level)
   - Pan culture: sputum / blood/ urine
   - Send glucan / galactomannan
   - Discussed broadening abx with ID since continued fevers. ID
   recommended staying with vanc (rather than lineazolid). If hypoTN or
   other clinical deterioration will re-discuss broadening with ID
   - TEE today
   - F/U ID and NSG recs
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio 400mg PO tid x1 week, started Sunday [**10-23**]
   #Acute transaminitis. Fri PM increase from ALT 19 -> 326; AST 26 ->
   1177. Now trended down. Most likely due to shock liver in setting of
   hypoTN during Afib RVR. Hepatic vein thrombosis unlikely in setting of
   anti-coagulation.
   - Defer RUQ U/S for now since unlikely to change management.
   - Statin d/c'ed.
   - Trend LFTs
   #Elevated cardiac biomarkers: Most likely [**1-17**] demand in setting of RVR
   / hypoTN.
   - Cont ASA
   - Defer BB in setting of intermittent hypoTN
   #Atrial thrombus: Elevated INR 5.9 to 9. Coumadin held x3d, now 1.4
   - Start heparin gtt
   #S/p epidural abscess, aortic endocarditis. Repeat spine MRI showed

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including asthma, gout, recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He is currently in the ICU for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with large right-sided infiltrate, hypoxemic respiratory failure on ventilator (APRV), and hypoTN (presumably hypotension). The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated cardiac biomarkers, acute transaminitis, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging shows improved right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray and no progression of discitis at L5-S1 compared to previous MRI. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for aspiration/HAP, diuretics, and anticoagulation therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is currently on ventilator support with APRV mode, indicating severe respiratory distress. The density of the right-sided infiltrate suggests a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, both of which can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Atrial thrombus: The patient has evidence of an atrial thrombus, which increases the risk of embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy is being initiated to prevent further thrombus formation and potential embolization.
3. Hypotension (hypoTN): The patient has had episodes of hypoTN, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure, including renal failure.
4. Acute transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes indicate acute liver injury, which can be due to various causes, including shock liver in the setting of hypoTN or viral hepatitis.
5. Aortic endocarditis: The patient has a history of aortic endocarditis, which increases the risk of embolic events and potential septic emboli to distant organs.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may be compromised due to hypoTN, medications, or sepsis.

Please note that the above summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) who presented to the hospital with fevers, lethargy, and was subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to right lung pneumonia. The patient is currently on assisted ventilation mode (APRV) and will continue to be weaned as tolerated.

2. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension and sepsis secondary to the pneumonia. The patient is off pressors and is being managed with diuresis to address fluid overload.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB/RVR): The patient had episodes of AFIB/RVR that required cardioversion and Neo for blood pressure support. The patient is now on oral amiodarone for rate control.

4. Troponin leak: The patient has evidence of troponin leak after an episode of AFIB earlier in the week. The elevated troponin levels may indicate demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension, renal failure, and AFIB/RVR.

5. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which may not necessarily represent failure of the current antibiotic regimen. Blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent hospitalization for epidural abscess and bacteremia. The patient presents with fevers, lethargy, and was subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off pressors.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has right aspiration pneumonia and is experiencing respiratory failure. The patient is on APRV and has been weaned to AC, then PS. It is recommended to keep the patient on the left side to improve blood flow to the left lung, continue vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin for pneumonia, and consider broadening antibiotics if the patient decompensates. Daily chest x-rays should be performed.
2. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and sepsis have resolved, likely due to pneumonia. The patient is off pressors and is fluid overloaded. Diuretics should be continued for negative fluid balance, and the same antibiotics as above should be continued.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR, which resulted in hypotension and required central venous pressure monitoring and neosynephrine for blood pressure support. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, but now presents with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, hypotension (not in shock), respiratory failure (acute), and altered mental status (not delirium).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/45 to 150/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation with a mode of APRV, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 100%.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,873 mL, including 698 mL of IV fluids, 660 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 983 mL of IV fluids since midnight. Output includes 2,340 mL of urine and 442 mL of drainage. The patient has received Lasix 40 mg IV with a good diuretic response of -500cc at midnight.

The patient's blood cultures were taken on 10/24 at 11:30 AM, and a transesophageal echo (TEE) was performed yesterday showing small vegetation on the a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. The patient is currently in the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia with dense, large right-sided infiltrate. He is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on the ventilator, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, along with pulmonary edema. The patient has been diagnosed with enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is reliant on the ventilator. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia with dense, large right-sided infiltrate indicates a potential complication of aspiration into the lungs, leading to infection and worsening respiratory function.
3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may be due to HAP, which is a common complication in hospitalized patients.
4. Aortic endocarditis: The patient has enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves. This can lead to septic emboli, heart failure, and other systemic complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and atrial thrombus. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient has been diagnosed with enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis. He continues to have fevers and his PNA is worsening, as seen on chest X-ray with bilateral infiltrates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to ensure adequate gas exchange.

2. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis: The patient has been diagnosed with enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis. This condition requires prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Monitoring for signs of septic emboli or worsening endocarditis is essential.

3. Atrial thrombus: Initially, the patient was thought to have an atrial thrombus; however, subsequent TEE revealed that there was no thrombus present. Nevertheless, the patient remains at risk for thromboembolic events due to his history of atrial thrombus. Monitoring for any signs of thromboembolism, such as stroke or systemic"

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and atrial thrombus. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia with dense, large right-sided infiltrate. He is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on ventilator support (APRV), likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The plan is to continue with APRV, wean FiO2 to 0.5 and further PaO2 > 65, consider switching to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV), continue antibiotic therapy (vanc/aztreonam/clinda) for aspiration/HAP, continue diuresis, and advance ET tube 3 cm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has a history of atrial thrombus and recent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib RVR), which can lead to decreased cardiac output and hypotension.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating potential renal dysfunction. This could be due to sepsis, hypotension, or other underlying conditions.

   unlikely to change management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including asthma, gout, recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and atrial thrombus. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with dense, large right-sided infiltrate. The patient is also suspected to have hypoxemic respiratory failure on ventilator due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA, along with pulmonary edema.

Assessment and Plan:
- Wean off PS (pressure support) as tolerated
- Consider switching to PCV (pressure control ventilation)
- Continue antibiotics (vanc/aztreonam Day 5-29 and clinda Day 4-24) for aspiration/HAP
- Continue diuresis
- Nebulized treatments
- Advance ET tube 1-2 cm
- Follow-up cultures
- Follow-up glucan/galactomannan
- Follow-up ID and NSG recommendations

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure on ventilator due to HAP/aspiration PNA + pulmonary edema.
2. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis.
3. Anemia: Hct from 24 to 22 today. No obvious source of bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the hospital for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by Pan-Sensitive Enterococcus. The patient presented with fevers, lethargy, and was subsequently intubated due to pneumonia affecting his entire right lung.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds and needs a nutrition consult.
2. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient has persistent fevers and an ongoing infection despite being on antibiotics. His white blood cell count is elevated.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient had an episode of AFIB with rapid ventricular response that required cardiac monitoring and treatment.
4. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure has been low, requiring Neo for blood pressure support.
5. Respiratory Failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has pneumonia in the entire right lung and is on mechanical ventilation.
6. Altered Mental Status (not delirium): The patient is sedated and unable to assess mental status.
7. History of Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient had a previous episode of sepsis with enterococcal bacteremia.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess and bacteremia. He presents from rehab with fevers and lethargy, subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, altered mental status, and right atrial appendage thrombus.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:
- Antibiotics (Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Clindamycin) for pneumonia.
- Diuretics (40 IV Lasix) to achieve negative fluid balance.
- MDIs as needed.
- Daily chest X-rays.
- Advance ET tube feeding.
- Blood cultures and urinalysis.
- Monitoring for atrial fibrillation.
- Amiodarone for rate control.
- Statin therapy on hold due to transaminitis.
- Fever management.
- Neurological evaluation.
- Right atrial appendage thrombus monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Recurrence of hypotension and sepsis: The patient had a previous episode of hypotension and sepsis, which resolved"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, atrial thrombus, NSTEMI) p/w
   aspiration PNA with dense, large R-sided infiltrate.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely [**1-17**] to HAP/aspiration
   PNA + pulmonary edema.
   - On PS with worsening CXR, likely [**1-17**] lower PEEP.  Will increase and
   repeat CXR in am.  Consider bronch if no improvement tomorrow.
   - Continue abx (vanc/aztreonam Day [**6-28**] and clinda Day [**5-25**]) for
   aspiration/HAP
   - Continue diuresis
   - Bronchodilators
   - Pull back ET tube 2 cm
   No attempt to wean on PSV until secretions/ fevers and clinical wheeze
   improve
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at
   this time from PNA.  Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and
   discitis stable. No new source identified. DVT unlikely given recent
   anticoagulation and now SQ heparin.  Would consider effusion/empymea
   given CXR appearance.  Drug fever would be dx of exclusion.
   - CT scan to evaluate for possible R sided effusion
 if effusion
   ,would have concern for empyema as source of fevers
   - Will scan abd/pelvis while at CT scanner
   - Cont vanc / aztreonam / clinda
   - F/U cultures
   - F/U galactomannan
   - F/U ID and NSG recs
   # Anemia: Hct stable.  No obvious source of bleeding.  Stool occult
   negative.
   - Hct goal >21
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio 400mg PO tid x1 week, started Sunday [**10-23**]
   - In sinus rhythm, so no anticoagulation at this time.  On aspirin.
   Long term anticoagulation plan deferred for closer to discharge.
   #Acute transaminitis: Most likely due to shock liver in setting of
   hypoTN during Afib RVR.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Restart lipitor
   #S/p epidural abscess, aortic endocarditis. Repeat spine MRI showed
   discitis L5-S1 that shows no progression compared with MR 3-4wks ago.
   New small fluid collection of uncertain significance.
   - NSY
 no intervention for now

- Patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, NSTEMI.
- The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with dense, large right-sided infiltrate.
- He is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on ventilator support.
- The assessment suggests that the patient may have hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA with pulmonary edema.
- The plan includes increasing PEEP, repeating CXR in the morning, considering bronchoscopic evaluation if no improvement tomorrow, continuing antibiotics (vanc/aztreonam Day [6-28] and clinda Day [5-25]) for aspiration/HAP, and diuresis.
- The patient has persistent fevers due to known PNA but no new source identified.
- There is concern for right-sided effusion/empyema given the worsening CXR appearance.
- A CT scan will be performed to evaluate for possible right-sided effusion and consider empyema as the source of fevers.
- The patient's anemia is stable, and there is no obvious source of bleeding.
- The patient is in sinus rhythm and will continue on aspirin with long-term anticoagulation plan deferred for closer to discharge.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, atrial thrombus, NSTEMI) p/w
   aspiration PNA with dense, large R-sided infiltrate.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely [**1-17**] to HAP/aspiration
   PNA + pulmonary edema.
   - On PS with worsening CXR, likely [**1-17**] lower PEEP.  Will increase and
   repeat CXR in am.  Consider bronch if no improvement tomorrow.
   - Continue abx (vanc/aztreonam Day [**6-28**] and clinda Day [**5-25**]) for
   aspiration/HAP
   - Continue diuresis
   - Bronchodilators
   - Pull back ET tube 2 cm
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at
   this time from PNA.  Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and
   discitis stable. No new source identified. DVT unlikely given recent
   anticoagulation and now SQ heparin.  Would consider effusion/empymea
   given CXR appearance.  Drug fever would be dx of exclusion.
   - CT scan to evaluate for possible R sided effusion
 if effusion
   ,would have concern for empyema as source of fevers
   - Will scan abd/pelvis while at CT scanner
   - Cont vanc / aztreonam / clinda
   - F/U cultures
   - F/U galactomannan
   - F/U ID and NSG recs
   # Anemia: Hct stable.  No obvious source of bleeding.  Stool occult
   negative.
   - Hct goal >21
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio 400mg PO tid x1 week, started Sunday [**10-23**]
   - In sinus rhythm, so no anticoagulation at this time.  On aspirin.
   Long term anticoagulation plan deferred for closer to discharge.
   #Acute transaminitis: Most likely due to shock liver in setting of
   hypoTN during Afib RVR.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Restart lipitor
   #S/p epidural abscess, aortic endocarditis. Repeat spine MRI showed
   discitis L5-S1 that shows no progression compared with MR 3-4wks ago.
   New small fluid collection of uncertain significance.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complications including an epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 101.9°F (Tmax: 38.8°C)
- Heart rate: 87 bpm (81-106)
- Blood pressure: 136/49 mmHg (120/41-195/59)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (12-29)
- Oxygen saturation: 95%
- Sinus rhythm

The patient has a dense, large right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray, which suggests a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia/aspiration pneumonia plus pulmonary edema. The plan includes increasing PEEP, repeating chest X-ray, and considering bronchoscopic evaluation if there is no improvement tomorrow"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU for fevers and lethargy, subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and troponin leak. He also has a history of enterococcal bacteremia and developed rashes to ampicillin and ceftriaxone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition indicates severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. This can lead to multiple organ failure if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to right aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR can cause hemodynamic instability and may require cardioversion or medication management.
4. Troponin Leak: The patient has elevated troponin levels indicating myocardial injury. This could be due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.
5. Fevers: The patient's persistent fevers may indicate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) who presented to the ICU with fevers, lethargy, and respiratory distress. He was subsequently intubated for right-sided pneumonia. The patient has a complex medical history including recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive Enterococcus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to right-sided aspiration pneumonia. He required mechanical ventilation and was later weaned to pressure support (PS) and then to spontaneous breathing. However, his condition worsened, and he required reintubation with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) due to increased atelectasis.

2. Sepsis: The patient presented with sepsis likely secondary to his pneumonia and enterococcal bacteremia. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin. Despite initial improvement, his condition decompensated, and additional antibiotics may be necessary.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): The patient experienced episodes of AFib/RVR, which required cardioversion and blood pressure support with neo. He was also started on oral amiodarone for rate control.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia affecting the entire right lung and is currently intubated. There is also evidence of increased atelectasis, which may indicate worsening respiratory function.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, and currently presents with persistent fevers. This suggests ongoing infection and possible sepsis.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB/RVR): The patient experienced an episode of AFIB with RVR, leading to hypotension. This required central venous pressure monitoring and nebulized oxygen for blood pressure support.

4. Troponin leak: The patient had a troponin leak after an episode of AFIB earlier in the week. This indicates possible myocardial ischemia, especially considering the patient's hypotension, renal failure, and AFIB with RVR.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are low, indicating anemia. However, no clear source of blood loss has been identified.

6. Right atrial appendage thrombus: Initially, there was a concern for a right atrial appendage thrombus, but subsequent echocardiograms did not show any thrombus.

7. Gout: Although not currently an acute issue, the patient has a history of gout.

8. Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient has known enterococcal bacteremia and developed a rash to ampicillin and ceftriaxone. Currently, the patient is on Vancomycin.

9. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, which may represent failure of current antibiotics or another underlying infection. Blood cultures have been negative to date, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not reveal any new endovascular infection.

10. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient initially had AMS likely due to fevers and infection. The AMS may be attributed to a large amount of sedation given.

11. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which required blood pressure support. This could be related to sepsis, AFIB/RVR, or other underlying conditions.

12. Nutritional issues: The patient requires nutrition support, as indicated by the initiation of tube feeds.

13. Gastrointestinal prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis and bowel regimen.

14. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The patient is on heparin subcutaneous injections for DVT prophylaxis.

15. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis: The patient is on measures to prevent VAP.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU. Imaging reveals multifocal pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, diffuse anasarca (generalized swelling), biliary sludge, and diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased to 22.4%. The patient has allergies to ampicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient received antibiotics (vancomycin, clindamycin, and aztreonam) from October 26th to October 27th. Infusions of fentanyl and midazolam are ongoing. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix) and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, blood pressure ranging from 129/41 mmHg to 150/56 mmHg, heart rate between 77 and 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,201 mL since 12 AM, with outputs including 1,011 mL of TF, 1,200 mL of IVF, and 3,720 mL of total output, resulting in a negative balance of 519 mL. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 735 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.26.

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's intubation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal potassium levels. The patient's blood cultures were positive for Acinetobacter baumannii on October 23rd and negative for other organisms. The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and hypotension.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alteration in nutrition
2. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction)
3. Atrial fibrillation
4. Hypotension (not shock)
5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
6. Altered mental status (not delirium)
7. H/O sepsis without organ dysfunction

ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren 2.0 (full) at 42 mL/hour. Glycemic control is also maintained. The patient has arterial and multi-lumen lines in place for monitoring and medication administration. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient's code status is full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, atrial thrombus, NSTEMI) p/w
   aspiration PNA with dense, large R-sided infiltrate.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely [**1-17**] to HAP/aspiration
   PNA + pulmonary edema.
   - On PS with worsening CXR, likely [**1-17**] lower PEEP.  Will increase and
   repeat CXR in am.  Consider bronch if no improvement tomorrow.
   - Continue abx (vanc/aztreonam Day [**7-29**] and clinda Day [**6-24**]) for
   aspiration/HAP
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt, follow [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need albumin
   - Bronchodilators
   - Recheck CXR given possible aspiration this am
   - No attempt to wean on PSV until secretions/ fevers improve
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at
   this time from PNA.  Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and
   discitis stable. No new source identified. DVT unlikely given recent
   anticoagulation and now SQ heparin.  Effusions on CT do not appear to
   be empyemas.  Drug fever would be dx of exclusion.
   - Cont vanc / aztreonam / clinda
   - F/U cultures, fever curve
   - Appreciate ID input
   # Anemia: Hct stable.  No obvious source of bleeding.  Stool occult
   negative.
   - Hct goal >25
 Transfuse 1 unit PRBC today.
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio 400mg PO tid x1 week, started Sunday [**10-23**]
   - In sinus rhythm, so no anticoagulation at this time.  On aspirin.
   Long term anticoagulation plan deferred for closer to discharge.
   #Acute transaminitis: Most likely due to shock liver in setting of
   hypoTN during Afib RVR.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Restart lipitor
   #S/p epidural abscess, aortic endocarditis. Repeat spine MRI showed
   discitis L5-S1 that shows no progression compared with MR 3-4wks ago.
   New small fluid collection of uncertain significance.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complications including epidural abscess, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia (PNA), bilateral effusions, biliary sludge, and diverticulosis. His recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. Imaging shows dense right-sided infiltrate.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary edema, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He has also had an epidural abscess requiring surgery and is now experiencing increased secretions and rhonchi on auscultation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely due to HAP/aspiration PNA + pulmonary edema.
   - Increase PEEP and repeat CXR in the morning. Consider bronchoscopy if no improvement tomorrow.
   - Continue antibiotics (vanc/aztreonam Day 7-29) and clinda Day 6-24"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, atrial thrombus, NSTEMI) p/w
   aspiration PNA with dense, large R-sided infiltrate.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely [**1-17**] to HAP/aspiration
   PNA + pulmonary edema.
   - On PS with worsening CXR, likely [**1-17**] lower PEEP.  Will increase and
   repeat CXR in am.  Consider bronch if no improvement tomorrow.
   - Continue abx (vanc/aztreonam Day [**7-29**] and clinda Day [**6-24**]) for
   aspiration/HAP
   - Continue diuresis with lasix gtt, follow [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need albumin
   - Bronchodilators
   - Recheck CXR given possible aspiration this am
   - No attempt to wean on PSV until secretions/ fevers improve
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at
   this time from PNA.  Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and
   discitis stable. No new source identified. DVT unlikely given recent
   anticoagulation and now SQ heparin.  Effusions on CT do not appear to
   be empyemas.  Drug fever would be dx of exclusion.
   - Cont vanc / aztreonam / clinda
   - F/U cultures, fever curve? Switch to flagyl with concerns regarding C
   Diff
   - Appreciate ID input
   # Anemia: Hct stable.  No obvious source of bleeding.  Stool occult
   negative.
   - Hct goal >25
 Transfuse 1 unit PRBC today.
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio 400mg PO tid x1 week, started Sunday [**10-23**]
   - In sinus rhythm, so no anticoagulation at this time.  On aspirin.
   Long term anticoagulation plan deferred for closer to discharge.
   #Acute transaminitis: Most likely due to shock liver in setting of
   hypoTN during Afib RVR.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Restart lipitor
   #S/p epidural abscess, aortic endocarditis. Repeat spine MRI showed
   discitis L5-S1 that shows no progression compared with MR 3-4wks ago.
   New small fluid collection of uncertain significance.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure from aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema.

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/aztreonam) for aspiration/HAP and clindamycin for C. diff coverage. Diuretics are being administered to manage fluid balance, and bronchodilators are given for asthma symptoms.

The patient has persistent fevers, likely due to known pneumonia. Effusions on CT do not appear to be empyemas. There are no new sources identified for the fevers, and drug fever would be diagnosed by exclusion.

The patient has anemia with a stable Hct level and no obvious source of bleeding. Transfusion of one unit of PRBC is planned to reach a Hct goal of >25.

The patient was initially on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response but has transitioned to oral PO dosing. He is currently in sinus rhythm and on aspirin. Long-term anticoagulation plans have been deferred until closer to discharge.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. The patient has been experiencing a fever of 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit, and their chest X-ray remains stable. The patient received a blood transfusion, resulting in a hematocrit (HCT) level of 25 at midnight. Their urine output (UOP) has been responding well to lasix, with a total output of 4 liters by midnight and a net output of -2.3 liters since morning.

The patient has allergies to ampicillin and ceftriaxone, and they have been on various antibiotics including vancomycin, clindamycin, and aztreonam. The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions, as well as furosemide (Lasix). They are also on prophylactic heparin sodium.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted fever. The vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.9 degrees Fahrenheit), with a current temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit). The patient's heart rate (HR) is within normal range, along with blood pressure (BP) and respiratory rate (RR). Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is at 100%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,225 mL and output of 4,570 mL since midnight, resulting in a negative balance of 2,345 mL. The respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 438 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 502 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 8.1 L/min.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), and platelet count (Plt). The blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and potassium (K+) levels are within normal limits, while the sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and glucose levels are slightly low.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented to the hospital with fevers, lethargy, and was subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic inflammatory response. There is a potential risk of progression to septic shock and multiorgan failure.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and the need for rate control medications. There is a potential risk of cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.

4. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be due to septic shock, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, or other underlying causes. There is a potential risk of organ perfusion impairment and further deterioration in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess and bacteremia. He presents with fevers and lethargy and was subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's right aspiration pneumonia may lead to further respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing fevers and leukocytosis indicate a possible ongoing infection, which could worsen his sepsis condition.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB/RVR): This condition can result in episodes of hypotension and may require cardioversion.
4. Troponin leak: The elevated troponin levels suggest myocardial injury, which may indicate ischemia in the setting of hypotension, renal failure, and AFIB/RVR.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's AMS could be due to multiple factors such as sedation, infection, or other underlying causes.
6. Right Atrial Appendage Thrombus: Although no thrombus was seen on the current ECHO, the patient's risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history including asthma, gout, recent complicated hospital course, epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure likely caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia (PNA), along with pulmonary edema. The patient's fever has been persistent, possibly due to the ongoing pneumonia. There is also evidence of aortic valve endocarditis and discitis, but no new source has been identified. Effusions on CT do not appear to be empyemas. The patient has an increased risk of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection due to recent antibiotic use, including clindamycin. The patient's anemia is stable after receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday. The patient was initially on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib RVR), but has now transitioned to oral amiodarone. The patient is in sinus rhythm and no longer requires anticoagulation, but will continue on aspirin. Long-term anticoagulation plan deferred until closer to discharge.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He presents with aspiration pneumonia with dense, large right-sided infiltrate, now improving. He is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on ventilator support and is likely suffering from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia. His condition is improving, and there are plans to consider extubation tomorrow morning if clinically doing well. Other ongoing issues include persistent fevers due to known pneumonia, stable enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis, negative glucan/galactomannan results, possibility of Clostridium difficile infection, and anemia with a stable hematocrit level after receiving one unit of packed red blood cells yesterday. The patient is also being treated for atrial fibrillation with rhythm control medication and has no obvious source of bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to HAP or aspiration pneumonia.
2. Clostridium difficile infection, especially given the recent use of clindamycin.
3. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis.
4. Atrial fibrillation with possible recurrence.
5. Anemia with a stable hematocrit level after receiving"

He is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on the ventilator, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration pneumonia plus pulmonary edema. The patient's recent antibiotics have been discontinued, and he is currently on vancomycin and aztreonam for aspiration/HAP. Diuretics with Lasix are being continued, and bronchodilators are also being administered. The patient is not attempting weaning off the pressure support ventilation (PSV) until secretions and fevers improve.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure on the ventilator: Continue abx (vanc/aztreonam Day [8-29]) for aspiration/HAP.
2. Persistent fevers: Known pneumonia, but would expect him to be afebrile at this time from pneumonia. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis stable. No new source identified. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) unlikely given recent anticoagulation and now subcutaneous heparin. Effusions on CT do not appear"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, NSTEMI. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia with dense, large right-sided infiltrate, now improving. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia/aspiration pneumonia plus pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has been improving, with a recent improvement in chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.
2. Aortic endocarditis and discitis: The patient has a history of enterococcus bacteremia and aortic endocarditis, which can lead to further complications such as septic emboli or heart failure.
3. Atrial thrombus: The presence of an atrial thrombus increases the risk of stroke or systemic embolism.
4. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, which puts him at risk for further cardiac complications.
5. L leg contracture: The patient has a contracture in his left leg, which may be due to a central process, inflammatory"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complications including an epidural abscess, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with dense, large right-sided infiltrate, which is now improving. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA, along with pulmonary edema. Antibiotics (vanc/aztreonam) have been continued for aspiration/HAP.

The patient has persistent fevers, possibly due to known PNA or enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis. There is no new source identified for the fever, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is unlikely given recent anticoagulation and now subcutaneous heparin. Effusions on CT do not appear to be empyemas, and glucan/galactomannan tests are negative. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a possibility due to increased diarrhea and clindamycin use. Drug fever would be diagnosed by exclusion.

The patient has a left leg contracture, which may be due to a central process, inflammatory or infectious arthropathy, or other causes. An MRI is pending, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with a dense, large right-sided infiltrate, which is now improving. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent due to likely hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA plus pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/49-182/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination shows crackles in the chest and diminished breath sounds. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal creatinine and liver enzymes. The patient's blood cultures have shown enterococcus bacteremia, and they have a history of aortic endocarditis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: The patient is likely experiencing this due to HAP/aspiration PNA plus pulmonary edema.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU for fevers, lethargy, and respiratory failure due to right aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with APRV, then AC, and finally PS mode. He has been receiving vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin for pneumonia, but these antibiotics were stopped on day 7 and 10, respectively. The patient's abdominal pain remains unchanged since the last imaging on 10/26. His blood cultures are negative for C. difficile. The patient has also had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, troponin leak, altered mental status, and right atrial appendage thrombus. His respiratory status has improved, but he still requires supplemental oxygen. His leukocytosis is improving, and he has been weaned off sedation. The patient's renal function remains stable, but he is oliguric. His nutritional status needs to be addressed, and he requires a nutrition consult for tube feeds. The patient's gout is not currently an acute issue. His code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to right aspiration pneumonia. Despite improvements"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to right aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on pressure support ventilation. The patient's abdominal pain, nutrition, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and altered mental status are being closely monitored. The patient's medications include Vancomycin, Aztreonam, Lasix, gabapentin, fentanyl patch, and prednisone. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, lactic acid levels, and troponin-T. The patient's imaging shows worsening chest x-ray with increased atelectasis. The patient's contracture in the left leg is concerning for central process or gouty arthritis. An MRI has been ordered to further evaluate this. The patient's pain control is being addressed with increased gabapentin and fentanyl patch. The patient's fevers and rising leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection, and fungal markers are negative. The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response required cardiovascular support. The patient's troponin leak is being managed with rate control and statin therapy. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to AMS or infection, and the right atrial appendage thrombus is being monitored without anticoagulation."

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented from rehabilitation for fevers and lethargy and was subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient has respiratory failure due to right aspiration pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has been treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin for pneumonia, but his condition has not improved. The patient also has a leg contracture concerning for central process or gouty arthritis of the knee. He has chronic pain exacerbated by weaning sedation, for which gabapentin and fentanyl patch have been increased. The patient's fevers and rising leukocytosis are unexplained, and he has been evaluated for sepsis. He also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that required central venous line placement and neosynephrine for blood pressure support. The patient has a troponin leak after an episode of atrial fibrillation earlier in the week, and his creatinine levels have increased. He initially had altered mental status likely due to fevers and infection, but currently, his mental status is difficult to assess due to large amounts of sedation.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath. The patient has a history of recent laminectomy surgery and is currently in the ICU due to sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient has been experiencing a fever, with a maximum temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit on [2146-10-30] at 04:00 AM. The MRI scan revealed a fluid collection adjacent to the right facet joint between L4 and L5, which demonstrates restricted diffusion. This could be secondary to blood products, but associated infection cannot be excluded.

The patient is on multiple medications including fentanyl, lasix, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs show a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/41 to 167/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL and a decrease in hemoglobin level of 25.3 g/dL. The blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 108-158 mg/dL. The results also show elevated levels of creatinine (2.5 mg/dL), potassium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was recently hospitalized for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by Pan-Sensitive Enterococcus. The patient presented with fevers and lethargy and subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to right aspiration pneumonia, a left leg contracture possibly due to gouty arthritis, pain control issues, fevers and rising leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, troponin leak, acute mental status change, and a right atrial appendage thrombus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to right aspiration pneumonia: The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation to support his respiratory function. However, there is worsening of the condition as evidenced by increased atelectasis on chest X-ray. The patient may require further interventions such as bronchoscopy or surgical intervention to clear the infection and improve lung function.

2. Left leg contracture possibly due to gouty arthritis: The patient has a history of gout, and the tenderness of the left knee suggests gouty arthritis. This condition can lead to joint deformity and limited mobility. The patient may need to be referred to a rheumatologist for definitive diagnosis and treatment.

3. Pain control issues: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and a recent complicated hospital course including an epidural abscess, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. He is currently in the ICU for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with dense, large right-sided infiltrate, now improving. The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure likely caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA plus pulmonary edema. He is also being treated for enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis, which are stable. The patient has persistent fevers, and there is a possibility of Clostridium difficile infection given increased diarrhea and clindamycin use. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to HAP/aspiration PNA + pulmonary edema.
2. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis.
3. Clostridium difficile infection.
4. Drug fever.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
6. L leg contracture.
7. Diffuse body pain.
8. Anemia.
9. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib RVR).

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course.
- He presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and is now improving.
- The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on the ventilator, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration PNA with pulmonary edema.
- His fever has persisted, possibly due to known PNA or Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis.
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/aztreonam) for aspiration/HAP and has had cultures negative.
- He is also receiving anticoagulation and has developed lower extremity edema, which may be related to his medical conditions.
- Other concerns include altered mental status, leg contracture, diffuse body pain, anemia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. HAP/aspiration PNA: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to HAP/aspiration PNA. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and consider weaning off the ventilator if the patient's condition improves.
2. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis: The patient has a history of Enterococcus bacteremia and aortic endocarditis. Monitoring for signs of worsening endocarditis and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
3. C. difficile infection:"

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely [**1-17**] to HAP/aspiration
   PNA + pulmonary edema.  CXR improving.
   - Continue abx (vanc/aztreonam Day [**10-29**]) for aspiration/HAP
   - Bronchodilators
   - Weaned PS to [**4-19**] now, SBT today, mental status is main barrier
   currently to extubation.
   - Stop diuresis, follow I/Os
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at
   this time from PNA.  Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and
   discitis stable. No new source identified. DVT unlikely given recent
   anticoagulation and now SQ heparin.  Effusions on CT do not appear to
   be empyemas.  Glucan/Galactomannan negative.  C .diff a posibility
   given increased diarrhea and clinda use.  Drug fever would be dx of
   exclusion.
   - Cont vanc / aztreonam, dosing vanco by level, due today
   - C-diff negative.
   - All cultures NGTD
   - CT-Chest/Abd per ID
   - Check diff on CBC
   - Appreciate ID input
 Meropenem for any decompensation
   # Altered Mental Status: Responds only to pain.
   - Head CT given poor MS
   # L Leg Contracture: Consider central process, vs inflammatory or
   infectious arthropathy
   - Await MRI read, d/w neurosurgery
   - Monitor L knee, hip, if tappable effusion tap given history of
   hematogenous infection, leaning towards gout,
   Rheum eval for ?tap ?gout
 if ID w/u is otherwise negative, would
   consider pred for gout flare.
   # Diffuse Body Pain: Still in marked discomfort despite fentanyl drip,
   neurontin.
   - Increase fentanyl patch, neurontin, wean fentanyl
   # Anemia: Hct stable s/p 1 unit PRBC yesterday.  No obvious source of
   bleeding.  Stool occult negative.
   - Hct goal >25.
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and atrial thrombus. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and is currently improving. He is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on the ventilator, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA plus pulmonary edema. The patient's fever is persistent, but this is likely due to known PNA. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis are stable, with no new source identified. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is unlikely given recent anticoagulation and now subcutaneous heparin. Effusions on the CT do not appear to be empyemas. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a possibility due to increased diarrhea and clindamycin use. Drug fever would be diagnosed by exclusion. The patient's altered mental status is a concern, as he only responds to pain. A head CT has been ordered due to poor mental status. The patient also has a leg contracture, which may be due to a central process, inflammatory or infectious arthropathy. An MRI read is awaited, and neurosurgery input is appreciated. The patient is still in marked discomfort despite a fentanyl drip"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess and bacteremia. He presented with fevers and lethargy and subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient has been on vancomycin (day 10 of 14) and aztreonam (day 10 of 14) and clindamycin stopped on day 7 of 10. His respiratory failure is due to right aspiration pneumonia. He has also been experiencing leg contracture and pain. The patient's fever and rising leukocyte count indicate possible infection, with negative fungal markers and pending fungal cultures. Legionella sputum and urine tests were negative, and urinalysis done yesterday was negative as well. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, troponin leak, altered mental status, and anemia. The assessment includes renal failure, fever, abdominal pain, chronic pain, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, respiratory failure (not ARDS), altered mental status, and history of sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.5-2, indicating pre-existing renal insufficiency. Acute kidney injury may occur due to se"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was recently hospitalized for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive enterococcus. The patient presented to the hospital with fevers and lethargy and subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. 

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure due to right aspiration pneumonia, renal failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, altered mental status, and troponin leak. 

The patient has been treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and clindamycin for the pneumonia, but these antibiotics were stopped due to a rash. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's left leg shows signs of contracture, which may be related to gout or muscle spasm. Pain control is a concern as the patient has chronic pain exacerbated by sedation weaning. 

The patient's fever and rising leukocyte count are not explained by the current infection or imaging studies. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and a CT scan of the abdomen/chest should be done to investigate further.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions, including acute renal failure, fever, history of abdominal pain, chronic pain, alteration in nutrition, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, respiratory failure (not ARDS), altered mental status, and history of sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 102.5°F, current temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate between 66-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/40 mmHg to 158/54 mmHg, respiratory rate between 7-15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with a total intake of 2,985 mL and total output of 1,895 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, vancomycin, and aztreonam.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of slightly low calcium levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.28.

   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, NSTEMI) p/w aspiration PNA with
   dense, large R-sided infiltrate, now improving.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely [**1-17**] to HAP/aspiration
   PNA + pulmonary edema.  CXR improving.
   - Finished 14 days of vanc/aztreonam for aspiration/HAP
   - Bronchodilators
   - Wean to PS; mental status currently main barrier to extubation given
   pain/sedation
   - Pain consult
   - I/Os even
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at
   this time from PNA.  Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and
   discitis stable. No new source identified. DVT unlikely given recent
   anticoagulation and now SQ heparin.  Effusions on CT do not appear to
   be empyemas.  Glucan/Galactomannan negative.  C .diff negative.   Rash
   and eosinophilia points to possible drug fever
   - Change abx to daptomycin
   - Appreciate ID input
 Meropenem for any decompensation
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely from oversedation due to pain regimen.
   Responds only to pain.  Head CT unremarkable.
   - Pain consult.
   # L knee/great toe pain: Concerning for gout.
   - Rediscuss with rheum regarding possible tap
   - L knee ultrasound
   - Send uric acid level
   - Consider pred for gout flare
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio started Sunday [**10-23**], tapered to 200mg tid [**10-30**].  Check EKG.
   - In sinus rhythm, so no anticoagulation at this time.  On aspirin.
   Long term anticoagulation plan deferred for closer to discharge.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complications including an epidural abscess, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He presents with aspiration pneumonia with a dense, large right-sided infiltrate, which is now improving. The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on ventilator support, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, along with pulmonary edema. His chest X-ray shows improvement.

The patient has been on antibiotics (vancomycin and aztreonam) for aspiration/HAP but is still febrile. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis are stable with no new source identified. Deep vein thrombosis is unlikely due to recent anticoagulation and now subcutaneous heparin. Effusions on CT do not appear to be empyemas, and Galactomannan and glucan tests are negative. Rash and eosinophilia suggest a possible drug fever, so the antibiotics have been changed to daptomycin. ID input is appreciated, and meropenem is considered for any decompensation.

The patient's mental status is altered, likely from oversedation due to pain regimen. He responds only to pain, and his head CT is unremarkable. A pain consult has been ordered"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
- The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with dense, large right-sided infiltrate, now improving.
- He is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on the ventilator and is likely to have hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA with pulmonary edema.
- The patient has persistent fevers, which are likely due to known PNA, but other sources have been ruled out.
- There are no signs of endocarditis or discitis, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is unlikely given recent anticoagulation and now subcutaneous heparin.
- Effusions on the CT scan do not appear to be empyemas, and fungal infections have been ruled out.
- The patient has developed a rash and eosinophilia, suggesting a possible drug fever.
- The patient's mental status is altered, likely from oversedation due to the pain regimen.
- The patient has pain in the left knee and great toe, concerning for gout.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is being treated with amiodarone.

   - Continue abx (vanc/aztreonam Day [**10-29**]) for aspiration/HAP
   - Bronchodilators
   - Weaned PS to [**4-19**] now, SBT today, mental status is main barrier
   currently to extubation.
   - Stop diuresis, follow I/Os
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, atrial thrombus, and NSTEMI. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with dense, large right-sided infiltrate, which is now improving. He is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation and is likely to have hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration PNA plus pulmonary edema.

The patient has persistent fevers, known PNA, but would expect him to be afebrile at this time from PNA. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis are stable, with no new source identified. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is unlikely given recent anticoagulation and now subcutaneous heparin. Effusions on CT do not appear to be empyemas. Glucan/Galactomannan negative. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a possibility given increased diarrhea and clindamycin use. Drug fever would be diagnosed by exclusion.

The patient also has altered mental status, responding only to pain, with a head CT given poor mental status. There is a concern for central nervous system (CNS) infection or inflammatory process causing leg contracture. An MRI read"

 FEVER - 103.8
F - [**2146-10-31**] 08:00 PM
   - Max fentanyl drip had been 125/hr and over the wkend, pt was switched
   to 200mcg/hr patch + 25mcg/hr drip. Apneic in the am but still in pain.
   Pain c/s requested to determine if there was a way to wean but still
   provide adequate pain control with another [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - Per them, there is no good way to do this as all ohter agents would
   further cloud mental status and complicate extubation.
   - Fentanyl patch decreased 200mcg/hr to 100mcg/hr and drip increased to
   provide transition, but total dose = 200+25-->100+50.
   - hypertensive with systolics over 200: hydral started and upttitrated
   overnight to 30 q6h. HTN improved with hydral, but mainly responsive to
   fentanyl.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU for fevers, lethargy, and subsequent intubation due to pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, fever, chronic pain, altered mental status, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and right leg contracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of fevers and is currently on antibiotics. Infections can worsen renal function, cause sepsis, and lead to further complications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may require prolonged mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and lung injury.
5. Right Leg Contracture: The patient has a right leg contracture, which may be due to immobility or joint issues. It can lead to pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and decreased mobility.
6. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic pain needs"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is experiencing severe pain and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic pain, renal failure, fever, altered mental status, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, respiratory failure, and altered nutrition. The patient is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, hydralazine, and others. The patient's vital signs show high blood pressure, normal heart rate, low respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, high potassium level, and normal liver function tests. The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has a history of renal failure, which can be exacerbated by factors such as dehydration, medication side effects, or sepsis.
2. Infection/sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen the patient's condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to their underlying medical condition or complications from mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator could be challenging due to the patient's pain and mental status changes.
4. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be carefully managed to prevent complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted from rehabilitation for fevers and lethargy, intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung, and diagnosed with acute respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics for suspected infections, including Vancomycin and Aztreonam, which were stopped on day 12, and Clindamycin, which was stopped on day 7.

The patient's current condition includes renal failure, fever, chronic pain, altered mental status, sepsis (previously without organ dysfunction), atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. He has also shown signs of leg contracture, pain that cannot be adequately controlled during sedation weaning, rising leukocytosis, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to his chronic renal insufficiency, sepsis, and possibly certain medications.
2. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, which could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
3. Chronic Pain: The patient has chronic pain exacerbated by weaning sedation. Pain management is challenging due to the need to avoid further clouding of mental status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and NSTEMI. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with dense, large right-sided infiltrate, which is now improving. He is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on the ventilator and has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA plus pulmonary edema. The patient's fever is persistent, likely due to known PNA, but other sources have been ruled out. Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis are stable, and there is no evidence of empyemas in the effusions on CT. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to oversedation from the pain regimen, and a head CT was unremarkable. The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response has been managed with amiodarone, and long-term anticoagulation plans have been deferred until closer to discharge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is currently on the ventilator due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely caused by HAP/aspiration PNA plus pulmonary edema. Monitoring and supportive care are crucial to manage this condition.
2. Persistent fevers: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, NSTEMI) p/w aspiration PNA with
   dense, large R-sided infiltrate, now improving.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely [**1-17**] to HAP/aspiration
   PNA + pulmonary edema.  CXR improving.
   - Finished 14 days of vanc/aztreonam for aspiration/HAP
   - Bronchodilators
   - Wean to PS; mental status currently main barrier to extubation given
   pain/sedation
   - I/Os even
   - Day 12 of ET tube
 if not extubated tomorrow, then will d/w family
   possible trach Thurs/Fri
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at
   this time from PNA.  Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and
   discitis stable. No new source identified. No DVT.  Effusions on CT do
   not appear to be empyemas.  Glucan/Galactomannan negative.  C. diff
   negative.   Rash and eosinophilia points to possible drug fever
   - Change abx to daptomycin for enterococcus endocarditis
   - Appreciate ID input
 Meropenem for any decompensation
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider fungal coverage if does not defervesce given yeast in
   sputum/urine.
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely from oversedation due to pain regimen.
   Minimally more responsive today.  Head CT unremarkable.
   - Wean sedation
   - Pain consult to come by formally when patient extubated and
   interactive
   # L knee/great toe pain: Concerning for gout.  Low suspicion for septic
   joints. No fluid on knee U/S.
   - Discuss possible septic joint with ID, but will hold on MRI for now
   - Start steroids
   - Send uric acid level
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio started Sunday [**10-23**], tapered to 200mg tid [**10-30**].
   - In sinus rhythm, so no anticoagulation at this time.  On aspirin.
   Long term anticoagulation plan deferred for closer to discharge.
   # HTN: Likely [**1-17**] to weaning sedation
   - Continue to uptitrate hydralazine
   # Emesis: NPO with OG tube to suction to prevent further aspiration
   events.

Summary:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and NSTEMI.
- The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation due to aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
- The patient has completed 14 days of vancomycin and aztreonam for aspiration/HAP.
- The patient's mental status is currently a main barrier to extubation due to pain and sedation.
- The patient's fevers are likely due to known pneumonia, and there is no new source identified.
- The patient has enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and discitis, which are stable.
- The patient's rash and eosinophilia indicate a possible drug fever.
- The patient has altered mental status likely from oversedation due to pain regimen.
- The patient has pain in the knee and great toe, which may be concerning for gout.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, initially on amiodarone and now transitioning to oral medication.
- The patient has hypertension, which may be related to weaning sedation.
- The patient experienced emesis and is currently on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been in the ICU since October 29th and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of sepsis, acute renal failure, fever, abdominal pain, chronic pain, alteration in nutrition, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and current mechanical ventilation indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. Monitoring oxygenation and ventilation parameters, as well as ensuring proper tube placement and patency, is crucial to prevent further respiratory compromise.

2. Sepsis: The patient's history of sepsis and ongoing fever suggest an ongoing infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, white blood cell count, and inflammatory markers is essential to detect any deterioration in the patient's condition.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate renal impairment. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and renal function tests is necessary to manage acute renal failure and prevent further deterioration.

4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be indicative of hypotension. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure, along with appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support, is important to maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs.

5. Atrial Fibrillation:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and was found to have aspiration pneumonia in his right lung. He has been intubated and placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient has been weaned off sedation and is now on minimal sedation.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute renal failure, fever, altered mental status, chronic pain, sepsis (with organ dysfunction), atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. The cause of these complications is likely due to his recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess and bacteremia, as well as his current condition of right aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current medications include gabapentin for pain control, fentanyl patch, and IV fentanyl for sedation weaning. He is also on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and aspirin and statin for troponin leak. His blood cultures, urine cultures, and fungal markers are pending, and he is being evaluated for possible sources of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to right aspiration pneumonia. This requires ongoing monitoring and management, including continued use of PSV and weaning off sedation.

2. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient has severe sepsis with organ"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) presenting with respiratory distress. He has been admitted multiple times recently for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by Enterococcus species. The patient presented with fevers and lethargy, leading to intubation due to pneumonia affecting the entire right lung.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had right aspiration pneumonia, but there has been improvement. He is currently off antibiotics and receiving treatment with daptomycin for Enterococcus infection. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) went well, but he is still not extubated.

2. Left Leg Contracture: The patient had a left leg contracture that improved after extubation and discontinuation of sedation. A lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) done yesterday was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The left knee is no longer tender, reducing concerns about gout.

3. Pain Control: The patient experiences chronic pain, which worsens during sedation weaning. He is being continued on gabapentin and fentanyl patch for pain management.

4. Fevers/Rising Leukocytosis: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis have improved, possibly due to drug fever/rash caused by vancomycin"

   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, NSTEMI) p/w aspiration PNA with
   dense, large R-sided infiltrate, now improving.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely [**1-17**] to HAP/aspiration
   PNA + pulmonary edema.  CXR improving.
   - Finished 14 days of vanc/aztreonam for aspiration/HAP
   - Bronchodilators
   - Wean to PS; mental status currently main barrier to extubation given
   pain/sedation
   - I/Os even
   - Day 12 of ET tube
 if not extubated tomorrow, then will d/w family
   possible trach Thurs/Fri
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at
   this time from PNA.  Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and
   discitis stable. No new source identified. No DVT.  Effusions on CT do
   not appear to be empyemas.  Glucan/Galactomannan negative.  C. diff
   negative.   Rash and eosinophilia points to possible drug fever
   - Change abx to daptomycin for enterococcus endocarditis
   - Appreciate ID input
 Meropenem for any decompensation
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider fungal coverage if does not defervesce given yeast in
   sputum/urine.
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely from oversedation due to pain regimen.
   Minimally more responsive today.  Head CT unremarkable.
   - Wean sedation
   - Pain consult to come by formally when patient extubated and
   interactive
   # L knee/great toe pain: Concerning for gout.  Low suspicion for septic
   joints. No fluid on knee U/S.
   - Discuss possible septic joint with ID, but will hold on MRI for now
   - Start steroids
   - Send uric acid level
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio started Sunday [**10-23**], tapered to 200mg tid [**10-30**].
   - In sinus rhythm, so no anticoagulation at this time.  On aspirin.
   Long term anticoagulation plan deferred for closer to discharge.
   # HTN: Likely [**1-17**] to weaning sedation
   - Continue to uptitrate hydralazine
   # Emesis: NPO with OG tube to suction to prevent further aspiration
   events.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and NSTEMI. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with dense, large right-sided infiltrate, now improving. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure on ventilator, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA + pulmonary edema. The patient has been on 14 days of vancomycin and aztreonam for aspiration/HAP, and is currently improving.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely HAP/aspiration PNA + pulmonary edema. CXR improving.
   - Finished 14 days of vanc/aztreonam for aspiration/HAP
   - Bronchodilators

   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, NSTEMI) p/w aspiration PNA with
   dense, large R-sided infiltrate, now improving.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure on vent: Likely [**1-17**] to HAP/aspiration
   PNA + pulmonary edema.  CXR improving.
   - Finished 14 days of vanc/aztreonam for aspiration/HAP
   - Bronchodilators
   - Extubate today
   # Persistent fevers: Known PNA
 but would expect him to be afebrile at
   this time from PNA.  Enterococcus aortic valve endocarditis and
   discitis stable. No new source identified. No DVT.  Effusions on CT do
   not appear to be empyemas.  Glucan/Galactomannan negative.  C. diff
   negative.   Rash and eosinophilia points to possible drug fever.  Now
   afebrile x 24 hours.
   - On daptomycin x 6 weeks from [**2146-9-30**] for enterococcus endocarditis
   - Appreciate ID input
 Meropenem for any decompensation
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely from oversedation due to pain regimen.
   Responsive today.  Head CT unremarkable.
   - Off sedation
   - Will assess pain once extubated and consider pain consult
   # L knee/great toe pain: Concerning for gout.  Low suspicion for septic
   joints. No fluid on knee U/S.
   - Observation for now as improved.
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio started Sunday [**10-23**], tapered to 200mg tid [**10-30**].
   - In sinus rhythm, so no anticoagulation at this time.  On aspirin.
   Long term anticoagulation plan deferred for closer to discharge.
   # HTN: Likely [**1-17**] to weaning sedation
   - Continue to uptitrate hydralazine
   # Emesis: NPO.  Will need formal assessment for aspiration before
   starting any POs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He presented from a rehabilitation facility with fevers and lethargy and was subsequently intubated for pneumonia of the entire right lung. The patient has been on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated today. There have been no overnight events. The patient has allergies to ampicillin and ceftriaxone. He received a course of vancomycin and aztreonam, which was stopped, and is still on daptomycin for the treatment of enterococcus.

The patient has several medical complications including hypertension, acute renal failure, fever, chronic pain, altered mental status, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and altered nutrition. He also has a history of aspiration, leg contracture, gout, anemia, and a right atrial appendage thrombus.

Plan:
- Continue monitoring and treating the patient's multiple medical conditions.
- Wean off hydralazine and transition to home medications for hypertension.
- Start amlodipine 10 and metoprolol 25 tid (home dose is 100).
- Continue post-pyloric doffhoff for recurrent aspiration.
- Continue gabapentin and fentanyl patch for pain control.
- Follow up blood cultures and urine cultures.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) who was recently hospitalized for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by Pan-sensitive Enterococcus. The patient presented to the hospital with fevers and lethargy and subsequently required intubation due to pneumonia affecting the entire right lung.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient had right aspiration pneumonia, which has now improved. He is off antibiotics and receiving treatment with Daptomycin for Enterococcus. The patient successfully underwent extubation and is doing well on a face tent. Albuterol nebs are given as needed, and the patient's oxygen level is being weaned as tolerated.

2. Left leg contracture: The patient's left leg contracture has improved after extubation and without sedation. A LENIS (left extremity nerve injury survey) done yesterday was negative for clot. The left knee is less tender to palpation, reducing concerns about gout. The patient will continue to be monitored, and follow-up recommendations from rheumatology and nursing will be implemented.

3. Pain control: The patient experiences chronic pain that has been exacerbated by weaning sedation. However, since sedation has been completely weaned, pain management strategies such as continuing gabapentin and f"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complications including an epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and NSTEMI. He was admitted with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and a dense, large right-sided infiltrate. He has now improved and was extubated on November 2nd.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to HAP/aspiration PNA and pulmonary edema. The patient has been extubated and is on bronchodilators and diuretics for management.

2. Persistent fevers: The patient initially had persistent fevers, which are now resolved and presumed to be drug fever. The patient is on daptomycin for enterococcus endocarditis and will continue this treatment for six weeks. ID input is appreciated, and meropenem may be considered for any decompensation.

3. Pain: The patient has knee pain concerning for gout. There is low suspicion for septic joints, and no fluid was found on knee ultrasound. Observation is being continued as the patient has improved. A pain consult may be considered in a few days once the mental status is fully cleared.

   - On daptomycin x 6 weeks from [**2146-9-30**] for enterococcus endocarditis
   - Appreciate ID input
 Meropenem for any decompensation.  Will discuss
   how to list drug allergies given numerous reactions to abx
   # Pain: Knee concerning for gout.  Low suspicion for septic joints. No
   fluid on knee U/S.
   - Observation for now as improved.
   - Consider pain consult in a few days when mental status fully cleared
   #Afib RVR: Initially on amio gtt, now transitioned to PO.
   - Amio started Sunday [**10-23**], tapered to 200mg tid [**10-30**]; 200mg daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He was admitted to the ICU for fevers and lethargy, and subsequently intubated for pneumonia affecting the entire right lung. The patient also had a recent hospitalization for an epidural abscess and bacteremia caused by pan-sensitive enterococcus.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had right aspiration pneumonia but has now improved and is off antibiotics. He is still on daptomycin for treatment of enterococcus.
2. Left leg contracture: The patient had a left leg contracture but it has improved after extubation and no longer exhibits signs of gout. Further follow-up with rheumatology and nursing recommendations is needed.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that is being managed with oral hydralazine. It will be transitioned to home medications including amlodipine 10 mg and metoprolol 25 mg three times a day. The hydralazine will be weaned as these medications take effect.
4. Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal endocarditis (VRE endocarditis): The patient received a course of daptomycin, which will finish on November 14th.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and NSTEMI. He presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and dense, large right-sided infiltrate. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for aspiration/HAP and extubated on 11/2. He is now showing signs of improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as indicated by the dense, large right-sided infiltrate and the initial need for mechanical ventilation. There is a likelihood of Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure due to HAP/aspiration PNA plus pulmonary edema. The patient has been extubated, but continuous monitoring is necessary.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which needs to be corrected to prevent potential complications related to fluid imbalance.
3. Enterococcus endocarditis: The patient has been diagnosed with enterococcus endocarditis, for which he is on daptomycin therapy. This condition requires long-term treatment and close monitoring to prevent further complications.
4. Pain: The patient was experiencing pain initially but has shown improvement. Pain management should continue to be addressed to ensure patient comfort.
5. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including an epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and NSTEMI. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia with dense, large right-sided infiltrate, which is now improving and the patient has been extubated.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration pneumonia (PNA) plus pulmonary edema. The patient finished 14 days of vancomycin (Vanc)/aztreonam for aspiration/HAP and is currently on bronchodilators and autodiuresis.
2. Hypernatremia: Fluid restriction for weight-based fluid management.
3. Right upper extremity (RUE) swelling: Likely due to positioning and diuresis. An ultrasound (U/S) is recommended to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
4. Enterococcus endocarditis: The patient is on daptomycin for six weeks starting from September 30th (end date November 14th) for enterococcus endocarditis. The patient experienced drug fever and rashes from other antibiotics.
5. Pain: Observation for now as improved.
6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Af"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including an epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with a dense, large right-sided infiltrate, which is now improving and he has been extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient may be at risk for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. RUE swelling: The patient has right upper extremity swelling, which could be due to positioning and diuresis. Further investigation is needed to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
4. Enterococcus endocarditis: The patient is being treated with daptomycin for enterococcus endocarditis. Drug fever and rashes from other antibiotics have occurred.
5. Pain: The patient is being observed for pain management as he has improved.
6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib RVR): The patient was initially on amiodarone but transitioned to oral medication. It is mentioned that amiodarone was started on Sunday, October 23rd"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. They have a history of hypertension, renal failure, fever, abdominal pain, chronic pain, alteration in nutrition, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, acute respiratory failure, and altered mental status. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), blood pressure ranging from 128/57 to 130/58 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as increased creatinine, glucose, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient has received various treatments, including medication infusions and interventions such as placing a PICC line and inserting a multi-lumen line. They are being provided with nutrition and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation indicate possible respiratory distress or inadequate oxygenation.
2. Renal failure: Elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection leading to sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M (h/o asthma, gout and recent complicated hospital course including
   epidural abscess requring surgery, enterococcus bactermia, aortic
   endocarditis, septic emboli to brain, NSTEMI) p/w aspiration PNA now
   improving and extubated [**11-2**].
   HAP/aspiration PNA + pulmonary edema-  Extubated [**11-2**] and resolved
   - Finished 14 days of vanc/aztreonam for aspiration/HAP
   - Bronchodilators
   - Autodiuresis
   Enterococcus endocarditis:
   - On daptomycin x 6 weeks from [**2146-9-30**] (end date [**2146-11-14**]) for
   enterococcus endocarditis ([**1-17**] drug fever and rashes from other
   antibiotics)
   - repeat echo without abscess or vegetations
   L5-S1 discitis/ osteomyelitis: stable from [**9-28**] to [**10-19**] MRI
   -will touch base re: f/u and tx for this as separate from endocarditis
   Hypernatremia: stabilized and not improved with increased free H2O
   flushes yest
   - cont enteric free H20, will give 500cc D5W today as well and monitor
   RUE swelling: Likely [**1-17**] positioning and diuresis
   - U/S to r/o DVT
   Afib RVR: resolved
   - now off amio and in sinus
   - no anticoag at this time, will f/u with Cards as an outpt
   HTN:
   - Continue to up titrate hydralazine, metoprolol, and amlodipine
   Aspiration risk:  Failed swallow study with tachypnea, desaturation and
   evidence of applesauce in pharynx.
   - Dobhoff placed and will cont tube feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of asthma, gout, and recent complicated hospital course including epidural abscess requiring surgery, enterococcus bacteremia, aortic endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, and NSTEMI. The patient presented with aspiration pneumonia, which is now improving and the patient has been extubated. He also had HAP/aspiration pneumonia with pulmonary edema, which resolved after finishing 14 days of vancomycin and aztreonam. The patient is currently being treated for enterococcus endocarditis with daptomycin for 6 weeks. An MRI showed stable L5-S1 discitis/osteomyelitis since September 28th, but will be managed separately from endocarditis. The patient's hypernatremia has been stabilized but not improved with increased free H2O flushes. He will continue with enteric free H2O and receive 500cc D5W today. The patient's right lower extremity swelling is likely due to positioning and diuresis, so an ultrasound will be done to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) has resolved, and he is now in sinus rhythm. He will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient and will not be on anticoagulation at this time. The patient's hypertension will continue to"
