   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 2232**] is a 64 yo female with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, history of GIB
   and MGUS, admitted after fall with possible new T3 burst fracture found
   to have a Hct of 17.
   # Anemia/Hct Drop: Patient has a history of GIB and rectal varices s/p
   TIPS and portal gastropathy now presenting with a Hct of 17, down from
   24.5 one month ago. Last EGD in [**2-19**] without varices.  Per ED report,
   patient was guaiac negative, although now patient is OB brown
   positive.  Hct 17.5->15.8 after 2 units PRBC.  Given history and guaiac
   positive stool, concerning for GIB and less likely MGUS progression.
   - Transfusing additional 2 units PRBCs
   - Trend hct Q6H, transfuse for hct<21
   - PPI IV BID, hold off on octreotide.
   - Consult hepatology
   - NGT placement for NGL
   - Correct coagulopathy with FFP
   # Thigh hematoma: Femoral CVL with only brown port working. Given that
   brown port still draws back, unlikely to be out of femoral vein.
   Hematoma likely secondary to coagulopathy.
   - Serial exams to watch for compartment syndrome and worsening
   hematoma.
   - Will need to re-site CVL when coags stable.
   # T3 Burst Fracture: Imaging shows no cord impingement. Per
   neurosurgery, no need for surgical intervention, but patient should
   have a brace and Q2 hour neuro checks.
   - Log rolling precautions until brace is obtained
   - Q2 hour neuro checks
   - F/U neurosurgery recs
   # Fall: History suggestive of mechanical fall.
   - Fall precautions
   - Will clear CT neck after final report
   - PT consult
   # Cirrhosis: Secondary to EtOH and HCV. Patient is followed at liver
   center.
   - Continue Lactulose/Rifaximin/Ursodiol
   - Trend LFTs
   - Consult hepatology
   # CKD: At baseline
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   FEN: NPO, replete as  necessary
   Prophylaxis: SCDS, PPI
   Access: PIV x1, femoral CVL
   Code: Full. Discussed with daughter and HCP, patient is full code with
   bridge to hospice.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, GIB, and MGUS.
- She was admitted after falling and possible new T3 burst fracture found with a Hct of 17.
- The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) dropped from 24.5 one month ago to 17 currently.
- She is positive for occult blood in stool (OB brown positive), indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
- The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with low blood pressure and tachycardia.
- She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), with a subsequent decrease in Hct to 15.8%.
- The patient has a thigh hematoma, likely secondary to coagulopathy, and requires close monitoring for compartment syndrome and worsening hematoma.
- Imaging shows no cord impingement related to the T3 burst fracture, and neurosurgery does not recommend surgical intervention.
- The patient should have a brace, log rolling precautions, and Q2 hour neuro checks.
- The patient's history suggests a mechanical fall, and fall precautions are necessary.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH and HCV, with ongoing management including lactulose, rifaximin, ursodiol, and hepatology consultation.
- She also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline.
- The patient's code status is full code with bridge to hospice.
- The patient's current disposition is ICU level of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): Given the patient's history of GIB and positive OB brown stool, there is a high risk of ongoing or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Thigh hematoma: The patient has a significant thigh hematoma, which could worsen and lead to compartment syndrome if not monitored closely.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation parameters are abnormal, indicating a risk of bleeding or clotting complications.
4. T3 burst fracture: Although neurosurgery does not recommend surgical intervention, the patient is at risk of neurological complications due to the spinal fracture.
5. Fall: The patient's fall suggests a mechanical cause, but further evaluation is needed to prevent future falls.
6. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis increases the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome.
7. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's CKD may progress, leading to further deterioration of renal function.
8. Hypotension and tachycardia: The patient's unstable hemodynamic status may indicate poor perfusion and increased cardiac workload.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to invasive lines and prolonged ICU stay."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with a chief complaint of fall and anemia. The patient had a multi-lumen central venous line (CVL) placed, which resulted in a thigh hematoma that was expanding. The patient received additional units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and packed red blood cells (PRBCs), but their hemoglobin (Hct) level remained low at 15.8%. The patient also had a brown output on the CVL draw, indicating possible blood contamination.

The patient's vital signs showed hypotension (BP 86/47 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 106 bpm). Their temperature was significantly low (Tmax: 35.8 C, Tcurrent: 35.6 C). The patient required supplemental oxygen with a SpO2 of 90% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's fluid balance showed an intake of 2,413 mL and output of 80 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,333 mL. The patient received 500 mL of intravenous fluid and 413 mL of blood products. 

The patient's laboratory results indicated anemia with a low Hct of 15.8%, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 69 K/uL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 161 IU/L. The patient's coagulation profile showed an INR of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). She was admitted after a fall with a possible new T3 burst fracture. The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 17, down from 24.5 one month ago. Her stool guaiac test was initially negative but is now positive for occult blood, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), with ongoing bleeding indicated by a positive brown port on central venous line (CVL).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia/Hct Drop: The patient has a history of GIB and rectal varices post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and portal gastropathy. She is presenting with a Hct of 17, down from 24.5 one month ago. Given her history and positive guaiac stool, there is concern for GIB rather than MGUS progression. The plan includes transfusing additional 2 units of PRBCs, trending Hct every 6 hours, transfusing for Hct <21, initiating proton pump inhibitor (PPI) IV BID, holding off on octreotide, consulting hepatology, placing a nasogastric tube (NGT), and correcting coagulopathy with FFP.
2. Thigh Hematoma: The patient has a femoral CVL with only the brown port working. The hematoma is likely secondary to coagulopathy. Serial exams will be performed to watch for compartment syndrome and worsening hematoma, and the CVL will need to be re-sited when coagulation parameters stabilize.
3. T3 Burst Fracture: Imaging shows no cord impingement, and per neurosurgery, there is no need for surgical intervention. The patient should have a brace and Q2 hour neuro checks. Log rolling precautions will be implemented until the brace is obtained, and follow-up with neurosurgery is recommended.
4. Fall: The patient's history suggests a mechanical fall. Fall precautions will be taken, and a CT scan of the neck will be performed after the final report. A physical therapy consult is also planned.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has secondary cirrhosis due to EtOH and HCV. She is being followed at a liver center. The plan includes continuing lactulose, rifaximin, and ursodiol, trending liver function tests (LFTs), and consulting hepatology.
6. CKD: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline. The plan includes trending creatinine levels and repleting electrolytes as necessary.
7. Code Status: The patient is full code with"

","Summary:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2232**] is a 64-year-old female with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), admitted after a fall with possible new T3 burst fracture. She has a hematocrit (Hct) level of 17, indicating anemia. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple issues including thigh hematoma, T3 burst fracture, GIB, and CKD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia/Hct Drop: The patient's Hct level is significantly low, which can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. This may be due to GIB or MGUS progression, and the patient is being transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase her Hct.
2. Thigh Hematoma: The patient has developed a thigh hematoma, likely caused by coagulopathy and femoral central venous catheter (CVC) placement. There is a risk of compartment syndrome and worsening hematoma, so serial exams are necessary. The CVC will need to be re-sited.
3. T3 Burst Fracture: The patient has a T3 burst fracture, but imaging shows no cord impingement. Neurosurgery has determined that no surgical intervention is needed. However, the patient should have a brace and q"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, GIB, and MGUS. She was admitted after falling and being found to have a hematocrit (Hct) level of 17.

2. The patient experienced multi-lumen stop, and an ultrasound revealed thigh hematoma. She received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (prbc) through the left femoral line, resulting in a decreased Hct from 17.5 to 15.8. Another 2 units of prbc were transfused through the peripheral line, increasing the Hct from 15.8 to 17, followed by two more units through the peripheral IV, raising the Hct to 28.

3. The patient also received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (ffp) and had a femoral line pulled. A vascular consult was requested, and the right lower extremity ultrasound showed a right groin hematoma but no evidence of arterial-venous fistula or aneurysm.

4. The patient was simultaneously consulted by palliative care and vascular surgery. The family is open to comfort measures only (CMO), but the patient wants full code status. She does not want to be disturbed.

5. The patient has ongoing allergies to Haldol and Darvon, with"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). She was admitted after a fall with a possible new T3 burst fracture and found to have a hematocrit (Hct) level of 17.

The patient experienced multi-lumen stop, thigh hematoma, and transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (prbc) through the left femoral vein, followed by transfusion through the peripheral intravenous (IV) line. Her Hct level increased from 15.8 to 17. Then two more units of prbc were transfused through the peripheral IV and her Hct level increased to 28. She also received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient has been consulted with palliative care and vascular surgery. She is open to comfort measures only (CMO) but wants full code status. The patient has ongoing bleeding with positive guaiac test, but her bleeding has stabilized.

The patient has a history of GIB and rectal varices post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and portal gastropathy. She is presenting with anemia/Hct drop. Her Hct level has decreased from 24.5 one month ago to 17 currently. She is OB brown positive,"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient has a history of dementia, HepC, and EtOH cirrhosis. They fell at home and fractured their vertebral body. The patient also has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 16 and has been transfused without an increase in Hct initially. The patient has a leg hematoma, and there are multi-lumen lines in place. The patient's allergies include Haldol (Oral) and Darvon (Oral), both with unknown reactions. The last dose of antibiotics, Ciprofloxacin, was given on 06/09/2016 at 02:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate and pantoprazole through IV infusions. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent fall. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/46-109/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and supplemental oxygen. The patient's physical examination reveals right thigh wrapped with ace, pulses present, T and C spine collar on, right ribs, guarding, bowel sounds present, and edematous extremities.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 2232**] is a 64 yo female with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, history of GIB
   and MGUS, admitted after fall with possible new T3 burst fracture found
   to have a Hct of 17.
   # Tachycardia: Likely secondary to persistent anemia in setting of
   femoral CVL bleeding. Less likely to be PE given no hypoxia. Patient
   without leukocytosis, although Tmax to 100.8 overnight suggesting
   possible infectious process. Patient also continues to be agitated and
   complain of pain, likely contributing to tachycardia.
   - UA and culture
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Q12H hct checks, transfuse for hct<21
   # Anemia/Hct Drop: Patient has a history of GIB and rectal varices s/p
   TIPS and portal gastropathy now presenting with a Hct of 17, down from
   24.5 one month ago. Last EGD in [**2-19**] without varices.  Per ED report,
   patient was guaiac negative, although now patient is OB brown
   positive.  Hct initially didn
t bump with transfusion because of left
   thigh hematoma and bleeding into space but now stable at 27, s/p
   removal of left femoral CVL.  Vascular following and no evidence of
   fistula or aneurysm.
   - As above, CBC Q12H, transfuse for hct<21 or plt<50
   - cont PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow-up hepatology recs if any. No plan on diagnostic or
   therapeutic intervention at this time.
   - PICC line for access
   - Correct coagulopathy with FFP if rebleeds, goal INR <1.5
   - Serial exams to watch for compartment syndrome and worsening
   hematoma.
   # T3 Burst Fracture: Imaging shows no cord impingement. Per
   neurosurgery, not a candidate for surgical intervention, but patient
   should have a mini-TSLO brace and Q2 hour neuro checks.
   - Clarify whether patient still needs log roll precautions
   - Q2 hour neuro checks
   - F/U neurosurgery and trauma surgery recs
   # Abdominal pain:  abdomen more tense this a.m. but positive bowel
   sounds, no peritoneal signs.  Would consider SBP given history of
   ascites versus bowel obstruction versus constipation. KUB negative for
   obstruction.
   - Bowel regimen
   # Fall: History suggestive of mechanical fall.
   - Fall precautions
   - PT consult when stable
   # Cirrhosis: Secondary to EtOH and HCV. Patient is followed at liver
   center by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2233**].
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin, and ursodiol.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Consult hepatology
   # CKD: At baseline
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   # Goals of care: Readdress goals of care with daughter and patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). She was admitted after falling and presenting with a possible new T3 burst fracture. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, agitation, and complains of pain. Her hematocrit (Hct) has dropped from 24.5 to 17, and she has a history of GIB and rectal varices post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and portal gastropathy. The patient tested positive for occult blood in the stool (OB) and her white blood cell count (WBC) is slightly elevated. She also has anemia, with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.4 g/dL. The patient's platelet count is low at 51,000/mm3, and her creatinine level is at baseline. She is currently receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may be secondary to her persistent anemia and femoral central venous line bleeding. Other possible causes could include pulmonary embolism (PE), although the patient does not exhibit hypoxia. Agitation and complaint of pain may also contribute to the t"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 2232**] is a 64 yo female with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, history of GIB
   and MGUS, admitted after fall with possible new T3 burst fracture found
   to have a Hct of 17.
   # Tachycardia, hypotension, fever: Likely secondary to persistent
   anemia in setting of femoral CVL bleeding. Less likely to be PE given
   no hypoxia. Patient without leukocytosis, although Tmax to 100.8
   overnight suggesting possible infectious process. Patient also
   continues to be agitated and complain of pain, likely contributing to
   tachycardia.
   - UA and culture
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Q12H hct checks, transfuse for hct<21
   - Bolus 1L IVF
   - CXR
   # Anemia/Hct Drop: Patient has a history of GIB and rectal varices s/p
   TIPS and portal gastropathy now presenting with a Hct of 17, down from
   24.5 one month ago. Last EGD in [**2-19**] without varices.  Per ED report,
   patient was guaiac negative, although now patient is OB brown
   positive.  Hct initially didn
t bump with transfusion because of left
   thigh hematoma and bleeding into space but now stable at 27, s/p
   removal of left femoral CVL.  Vascular following and no evidence of
   fistula or aneurysm.
   - As above, CBC Q12H, transfuse for hct<21 or plt<50
   - Cont PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow-up hepatology recs if any. No plan on diagnostic or
   therapeutic intervention at this time.
   - PICC line for access
   - Correct coagulopathy with FFP if rebleeds, goal INR <1.5
   - Serial exams to watch for compartment syndrome and worsening
   hematoma.
   # T3 Burst Fracture: Imaging shows no cord impingement. Per
   neurosurgery, not a candidate for surgical intervention, but patient
   should have a mini-TSLO brace and Q2 hour neuro checks.
   - Clarify whether patient still needs log roll precautions
   - Q2 hour neuro checks
   - F/U neurosurgery and trauma surgery recs
   # Abdominal pain:  abdomen more tense this a.m. but positive bowel
   sounds, no peritoneal signs.  Would consider SBP given history of
   ascites versus bowel obstruction versus constipation. KUB negative for
   obstruction.
   - Bowel regimen
   # Fall: History suggestive of mechanical fall.
   - Fall precautions
   - PT consult when stable
   # Cirrhosis: Secondary to EtOH and HCV. Patient is followed at liver
   center by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2233**].
   - Continue lactulose, rifaxamin, and ursodiol.
   - Continue cipro for SBP ppx.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Consult hepatology
   # CKD: At baseline
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   # Goals of care: Readdress goals of care with daughter and patient.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old female with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, history of GIB and MGUS, admitted after a fall with a possible new T3 burst fracture.
- The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, fever, and agitation.
- She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and rectal varices, and she presented with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 17, which is low.
- The patient had a femoral central venous line (CVL) that was removed due to bleeding, and she received blood transfusions.
- Imaging shows no cord impingement, and the patient is not a candidate for surgical intervention for the T3 burst fracture.
- The patient's abdomen is tense, but with positive bowel sounds and no peritoneal signs. She has a history of ascites, bowel obstruction, and constipation.
- The patient's vital signs include tachycardia, hypotension, and fever.
- Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and kidney dysfunction.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to ethanol (EtOH) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).
- She has chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline.
- The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is on multiple medications for prophylaxis and treatment of various conditions.
- The patient's family meeting and goals of care need to be readdressed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and an elevated lactate level, suggesting possible infection. The patient is also on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB, low Hct, and bleeding into space due to a femoral CVL. She received blood transfusions and has ongoing monitoring for coagulopathy.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient is on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula, and there is a concern for potential pulmonary complications.
4. Neurological issues: The patient has a T3 burst fracture with no surgical intervention planned. She should have neurologic checks every 2 hours, and there is a concern for potential neurological complications.
5. Abdominal pain and potential complications: The patient's abdomen is tense, and she has a history of ascites, bowel obstruction, and constipation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of abdominal pain and potential complications.
6. Fall-related complications: The patient had a fall, and there is a concern for mechanical fall-related injuries. Fall precautions are in place, and a physical therapy consult is recommended.
7. Cirrhosis-related complications: The patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH and HCV. She is on medications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, GIB, and MGUS. She was admitted after a fall with a possible new T3 burst fracture and was found to have a low hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 17. The patient has multiple medical complications, including anemia, hct drop, tachycardia, abdominal pain, CKD, and cirrhosis. She is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be secondary to persistent anemia due to femoral central venous line bleeding. Less likely to be a pulmonary embolism given no hypoxia.
2. Anemia/Hct Drop: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and rectal varices, which have been managed with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and portal gastropathy. She now presents with a significantly low hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 17, down from 24.5 one month ago. The patient also has a thigh hematoma and bleeding into the space, but is now stable after the removal of the left femoral central venous catheter (CVL). Close monitoring of the CBC every 12 hours, with transfusion for Hct <21 or platelet count <50, is recommended.
3. T3 Burst Fracture: Imaging shows no cord impingement. The patient is not a candidate for surgical intervention, but should have a mini-thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TSLO) brace and Q2 hour neuro checks. Clarify whether the patient still needs log roll precautions and consult neurosurgery and trauma surgery for further recommendations.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdomen is more tense this morning but has positive bowel sounds, with no peritoneal signs. There is a concern for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) given her history of ascites, bowel obstruction, or constipation. KUB is negative for obstruction.
5. Fall: The patient's history suggests a mechanical fall. Implement fall precautions and consult physical therapy when stable.
6. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is secondary to ethanol (EtOH) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Continue lactulose, rifaximin, and ursodiol. Trend liver function tests (LFTs) and consult hepatology.
7. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has CKD at baseline. Continue to trend creatinine levels.
8. Goals of Care: Readdress goals of care with the daughter and patient, considering input from palliative care.
9. Code Status: Do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 2232**] is a 64 yo female with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, history of GIB
   and MGUS, admitted after fall with possible new T3 burst fracture found
   to have a Hct of 17.
   # Tachycardia: Likely secondary to persistent anemia in setting of
   femoral CVL bleeding. Less likely to be PE given no hypoxia. Patient
   without leukocytosis, although Tmax to 100.8 overnight suggesting
   possible infectious process. Patient also continues to be agitated and
   complain of pain, likely contributing to tachycardia.
   - UA and culture
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Q12H hct checks, transfuse for hct<21
   # Anemia/Hct Drop: Patient has a history of GIB and rectal varices s/p
   TIPS and portal gastropathy now presenting with a Hct of 17, down from
   24.5 one month ago. Last EGD in [**2-19**] without varices.  Per ED report,
   patient was guaiac negative, although now patient is OB brown
   positive.  Hct initially didn
t bump with transfusion because of left
   thigh hematoma and bleeding into space but now stable at 27, s/p
   removal of left femoral CVL.  Vascular following and no evidence of
   fistula or aneurysm.
   - As above, CBC Q12H, transfuse for hct<21 or plt<50
   - cont PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow-up hepatology recs if any. No plan on diagnostic or
   therapeutic intervention at this time.
   - PICC line for access
   - Correct coagulopathy with FFP if rebleeds, goal INR <1.5
   - Serial exams to watch for compartment syndrome and worsening
   hematoma.
   # T3 Burst Fracture: Imaging shows no cord impingement. Per
   neurosurgery, not a candidate for surgical intervention, but patient
   should have a mini-TSLO brace and Q2 hour neuro checks.
   - Clarify whether patient still needs log roll precautions

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, GIB, and MGUS. She was admitted after a fall with a possible new T3 burst fracture. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, which is likely secondary to persistent anemia in the setting of femoral CVL bleeding. Other potential causes such as PE are less likely due to the absence of hypoxia. The patient also has a high Tmax suggesting a possible infectious process. She continues to be agitated and complains of pain, which may contribute to the tachycardia.

The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 24.5 to 17, indicating significant blood loss. This could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other sources. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and rectal varices, and she underwent a TIPS procedure. She also has portal gastropathy. The patient's blood type is O positive, and she has a positive guaiac test, indicating the presence of blood in the stool.

The patient's platelet count is low, and she has been transfused with platelets. Her INR is elevated, indicating a coagulopathy. The patient has been placed on prophylactic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) and stress ulcer prophylaxis (PPI). She is also receiving lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has a history of CKD at"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient has a history of [medical history], and is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 101/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever.

The patient's physical examination reveals sinus tachycardia, and there are no assessments available for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status. The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 69 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, low blood glucose levels ranging from 71-84 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests. Coagulopathy is also present with prolonged PT/INR and PTT.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension, fever, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, altered mental status, pain control, fracture, liver function abnormalities, and coagulopathy. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is discussed, and the total time spent in the ICU is noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis or septic shock if not promptly treated.

2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's low blood pressure and tachycardia may suggest hemodynamic instability, potentially due to hypovolemia from blood loss or septic shock. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation or vasopressor support may be required.

3. Acute kidney injury: The elevated creatinine level and low urine output indicate possible acute kidney injury. This could be due to prerenal causes like hypovolemia or intrinsic renal damage. Prompt identification and management are crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/INR and PTT suggest a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of clotting factors and appropriate replacement therapy may be necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

5. Liver dysfunction: Abnormal liver function tests indicate possible hepatic involvement. Further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
