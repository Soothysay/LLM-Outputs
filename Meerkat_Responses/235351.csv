","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He presented with bradycardia associated with a history of diltiazem overdose, lactic acidosis, and low mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is still slightly below normal limits. Close monitoring and administration of calcium gluconate and atropine as needed are recommended to manage this condition.

2. Lactic Acidosis: Although the lactate levels have improved, it is important to continue following ABG results and holding metformin to prevent further lactic acidosis. The possible etiologies include metformin or sepsis, so careful assessment is required.

3. Hypotension: The patient's MAP is low, indicating potential hypotension. This could be due to sepsis or the effects of diltiazem. Appropriate antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and zosyn should be continued while determining the source of low MAP. Close monitoring of vital signs and adjustment of medication doses are necessary.

4. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient has significant obstructive lung disease and is mildly wheezy. Hypercapnia is likely due to hypoventilation. Albuterol and ipratroprium should be administered as needed. Monitoring ABG and"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. She presented with bradycardia and is suspected to have overdosed on diltiazem. The patient also has lactic acidosis, hypotension, and respiratory distress. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 125/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on face tent. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 31.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 27%, platelet count of 512 K/uL, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, troponin of 0.03, total CO2 of 22 mmol/L, glucose of 82 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 3.3 mmol/L. The PT/PTT/INR is 34.8/29.9/3.7, ALT/AST is 70/94, LDH is 284 IU/L, calcium is 8.3 mg/dL, magnesium is 1.2 mg/dL, and phosphate is 4.2 mg/dL.

The patient's chest X-ray shows improved aeration of the right lung base with persistent opacity possibly reflecting resolving pneumonia.

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Bradycardia: likely due to diltiazem overdose. The patient's heart rate improved with dopamine and insulin. Continue insulin drip with d10 titrated to keep blood glucose above 80, and provide amps of d50 PRN low blood glucose. Wean dopa as tolerated, confirm with tox regarding endpoint for insulin drip, and administer calcium gluconate and atropine PRN.
- Lactic acidosis: possible etiologies include metformin or sepsis. The gap is nearly normal at 12, and lactate improved to 3.3. ABG improved this morning. Hold metformin, and consider sepsis as a possibility. No dialysis is required.
- Hypotension: low MAPs last night. Differential diagnosis includes sepsis, although no clear source is identified, or diltiazem. Hypothermia argues for infection, as does leukocytosis. Recently had pneumonia which could be a source of sepsis, but it appears to be improving. Administer vanc/zosyn for 48 hours while determining source for low MAPs, and follow up with blood cultures, urinalysis, stool culture, and sputum culture to determine if antibiotics can be discontinued.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He presented with bradycardia, lactic acidosis, and low mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient's current condition is stable, but he has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, which could be due to an overdose of diltiazem. Dopamine infusion has helped improve the heart rate.
2. Lactic acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, which could be caused by sepsis or metformin toxicity. The gap is nearly normal, indicating a possible septic cause. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, with preserved systolic blood pressure but low MAP. Differential diagnoses include sepsis and diltiazem overdose. Hypothermia and leukocytosis also suggest possible infection. Recent pneumonia could be a source of sepsis.
4. Respiratory acidosis: The patient has significant obstructive lung disease and is mildly wheezy on examination. Hypercapnia is likely due to hypoventilation.
5. Renal failure: The patient may have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to bradycardia and low blood flow. Creatinine is improving, indicating potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 81 yo with PMH of asthma, DM2, HTN presenting with bradycardia
   with history of diltiazem overdose, lactic acidosis, and low MAP.
   .
   #1 Bradycardia: likely [**3-14**] diltiazem.  HR improved with dopamin,
   insulin.
   - cont insulin drip with d10 titrated to keep BG above 80, amps of d50
   prn low BG
   - wean dopa as tolerated
   - confir w/tox regarding endpoint for insulin drip
   - calcium gluconate, atropine prn
   - hold nodal blocking agents
   .
   #2 lactic acidosis: possible etiologies include metformin or sepsis.
   Gap nearly normal at 12.  Lactate improved to 3.3.  ABG improved this
   morning.
   - hold metformin
   - see below re: hypotension for sepsis discussion
   - per renal, no dialysis
   .
   #3 hypotension: Low MAPs last night. DDx includes sepsis though no
   clear source, or diltiazem.  Hypothermia argues for infection, as does
   leukocytosis (though there could be contribution from stress).
   Recently had pna which could be a source of sepsis, but it appears to
   be improving by CXR.
   - vanc/zosyn for 48h while determining source for low MAP
   - BCx, UCx, stool cx, sputum Cx follow-up -> can D/C antibiotics if no
   clear source of infection is identified
   - wean dopamine as tolerated
   .
   #4 respiratory distress: She has significant obstructive lung disease,
   not moving air well on exam and subjectively sob.
   - albuterol and ipratroprium standing
   - add inhaled fluticasone
   - start IV solumedrol at 125mg Q8h IV
   - follow ABG, sats if distress worsens
   .
   # Renal failure: likely [**3-14**] to ATN while bradycardic.  Cr is improving.
   - urine lytes
   - follow Cr
   .
   # afib: currently in sinus rhythm
   - holding coumadin as supertherapeutic

   # DM: insulin drip and d10 as above.  holding metformin.  ISS when drip
   is d/c'd.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with bradycardia, lactic acidosis, and low mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate improved with dopamine and insulin. She is currently on an insulin drip to maintain blood glucose levels above 80 mg/dL. Dopamine is being weaned as tolerated, and calcium gluconate and atropine are provided as needed.
- Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels have improved from 5.1 to 3.3. The possible causes of lactic acidosis include metformin or sepsis. Metformin has been held, and further evaluation is needed to determine if sepsis is the cause.
- Hypotension: The patient experienced low MAPs last night, which could be due to sepsis or diltiazem overdose. Hypothermia and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an infection. The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for 48 hours while the source of infection is being determined. If no clear source is identified, antibiotics may be discontinued.

         - diurese with lasix
   b) Asthma
 hx of obstructive lung disease
        - standing albuterol and ipratroprium nebs

        - IV solumedrol at 125mg Q8h IV
   c) ? Pneumonia
 pt. recently treated with azithromycin & levofloxacin
   for PNA, now with GPCs in blood cultures

   # Bacteremia: Patient with GPCs in [**2-11**] bottles from admission blood
   cultures this morning.  Speciation pending.  Patient with recent
   hospitalizations.  Potential organisms include Clostridial species and
   Listeria.  Patient continues to have significant leukocytosis, although
   now on IV steroids, so this will cloud the picture.
   - Continue Vanc & Zosyn
   - Start Flagyl
   - f/u cultures, fever curve, WBC count
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - check hemolysis labs
   - check blood smear
   # Heart Rate: Initially was bradycardic, likely secondary to diltiazem
   toxicity and decreased renal function.  Is on Atenolol 100, Nifedipine
   60, and Diltiazem 240 daily at home.  All of these meds were held
   initially.  Metoprolol 25 mg started last night and patient was
   tachycardic early this am.
   - increase metoprolol to 50 PO BID
   - Start diltiazem 30 PO QID
   - Continue telemetry monitoring
   # Blood pressure: Initially hypotensive on presentation now
   hypertensive with SBPs in 160s this am, likely due to holding of her
   home antihypertensive medication regimen.  Restarting as above.  Will
   gradually uptitrate given previous medication toxicity and concern for
   infection / possible sepsis based on positive blood culture.
   .
   #2 lactic acidosis: Nearly resolved.  Gap 14.  Possible etiologies
   include metformin or sepsis.  Lactate improved to 1.4.
   - hold metformin
   - treating for bacteremia

   # Renal failure: Resolving, creatinine down to 1.4 from 2.1 on
   admission.  Pre-renal vs. \[**3-14**] to ATN while bradycardic.
   - follow Cr

   # Afib: currently in sinus rhythm
   - coumadin was held as supertherapeutic on admission. 2.9 today, will
   consider restarting
   .
   # DM: Holding metformin & glipizide.  ISS was stopped when drip was

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. She presented with bradycardia, lactic acidosis, and low mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient was initially on non-invasive ventilation due to work of breathing (WOB) issues, and later transitioned to BiPAP. She also required nebulizers for respiratory support. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/73 mmHg to 154/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has worsening pulmonary edema on chest X-ray (CXR), which improved with BiPAP. She has a history of obstructive lung disease, and her asthma is being treated with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. There is a concern for possible pneumonia, and she is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Blood cultures show growth of gram-positive cocci (GPCs), and potential organisms include Clostridial species and Listeria.

The patient's heart rate was initially bradycardic but has improved to tachycardia. She was taking diltiazem, nifed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a presentation of diltiazem excess, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress, and mild persistent metabolic acidosis. 

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acidosis, and potential renal failure. There is also a history of pneumonia, which appears to be hospital-acquired. The patient has atrial flutter as well.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for worsening respiratory failure due to bilateral pulmonary edema and increased effusions. Acidosis persists, and the presence of gram-positive rods in the blood suggests a possible infection. Renal failure may be a concern due to the elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). 

The patient's glycemic control should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. There is also a mention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory distress, acidosis, potential renal failure, and other associated conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 81 yo with PMH of asthma, DM2, HTN presenting with bradycardia
   with history of diltiazem overdose, lactic acidosis, and low MAP.
   .
   #1 Respiratory distress: Multiple likely contributing etiologies
   including copd, volume overload, and pneumonia.  Today MUCH improved.
   Patient
s O2 saturation in high 90
s on 2L nasal canula (yesterday and
   day before was tachypnic and requiring bipap)
   a) Volume overload / pulmonary edema due to bradycardic CHF due to ccb
   overdose: evidence for worsening pulmonary edema on CXR and rapid
   improvement on BiPAP
         - diurese with Lasix
         - treat ccb overdose to restore normal cardiac output
   b) obstructive lung disease: less likely contributory considering
   respiratory alkalosis at presentation. Initially added solumedrol as
   patient had just finished prednisone taper, but now ok to d/c steroids
   as most likely etiology is pulmonary edema
        - standing albuterol and ipratroprium nebs
        - add inhaled fluticasone
        - d/c IV solumedrol at 125mg Q8h IV
   c) ? Pneumonia
 pt. recently treated with azithromycin & levofloxacin
   for PNA, now with GPCs in blood cultures
        - treat w/vancomycin, flagyl, and zosyn until GPR is speciated.
        - follow ABG, sats if distress worsens
   #2 Bacteremia: Patient with GPCs in [**2-11**] bottles from admission blood
   cultures yesterday.  Speciation pending.  Patient with recent
   hospitalizations.  Potential organisms include Clostridial species and
   Listeria.  Patient continues to have significant leukocytosis, although
   that has improved.  On IV steroids, so this could contribute.
   Hemolysis labs negative and blood smear was normal which is evidence
   against Clostridium bacteremia.
   - Continue Vanc, Zosyn, Flagyl
   - f/u cultures, speciation of GPR
   - daily surveillance cultures
   #3 Heart Rate: Initially was bradycardic, likely secondary to diltiazem
   toxicity and decreased renal function.  Is on Atenolol 100, Nifedipine
   60, and Diltiazem 240 SR daily at home.  All of these meds were held
   initially.  Metoprolol 25 mg started last night and patient was
   tachycardic early this am.
   - increase metoprolol to 50 PO BID
   - Start diltiazem 30 PO QID
   - Continue telemetry monitoring
   #4 Blood pressure: Initially hypotensive on presentation now
   hypertensive with SBPs in 160s this am, likely combination of holding
   of home antihypertensive medication regimen and IV steroids.
   Restarting as above.
   - d/c steroids
   - Will gradually uptitrate HTN meds given previous medication toxicity
   and possible contribution of steroids
   .
   # lactic acidosis: resolved.  Gap 14.  Possible etiologies include
   metformin or sepsis.  Lactate improved.
   - hold metformin
 patient should NOT receive metformin for DM control.
   - treating for bacteremia
   .
   # Renal failure: Resolving, creatinine down to 1.5 from 2.1 on
   admission.
   -          Renal u/s negative
   -          Follow Cr
   .
   # Afib: currently in sinus rhythm
   - coumadin was held as supertherapeutic on admission. 2.8 today, will
   restart at low dose (2mg).
   .
   # DM: Holding metformin.  ISS was started when drip was d/c'd.  Blood
   sugars are elevated again this am, likely secondary to holding of PO
   meds and steroids.
   -          re-start glipizide
   -          d/c steroids
   -          to re-assess ISS needs tomorrow and adjust meds as
   appropriate
   ..
   # FEN: reg diet, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: famotidine, bowel regimen, d/c heparin sc
   .
   # Code: full, discussed with patient and son
   .
   # Dispo: appropriate for call-out to floor today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. He presented with bradycardia, lactic acidosis, low mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory distress, and bacteremia. The patient was treated with BiPAP, diuretics, steroids, antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin, and metronidazole), and adjustments in cardiac medications. His respiratory distress has improved significantly. The patient still requires ongoing treatment for potential pneumonia and bacteremia. His heart rate and blood pressure have been managed with medication adjustments. Lactic acidosis, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation have resolved. The patient's diabetes management involves holding metformin and restarting oral hypoglycemic agents. Renal function is improving. The patient's current condition is stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress due to volume overload/pulmonary edema, obstructive lung disease, or pneumonia.
2. Bacteremia with possible infection from gram-positive cocci.
3. Bradycardia and hypertension due to medication overdose/toxicity.
4. Lactic acidosis possibly related to sepsis or metformin use.
5. Renal failure.
6. Atrial fibrillation.
7. Poor glycemic control.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 81 yo with PMH of asthma, DM2, HTN presenting with bradycardia
   with history of diltiazem overdose, lactic acidosis, and low MAP.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Multiple likely contributing etiologies
   currently:
   a) Volume overload / pulmonary edema: evidence for worsening pulmonary
   edema on CXR and rapid improvement on BiPAP
         - diurese with lasix
   b) Asthma
 hx of obstructive lung disease
        - standing albuterol and ipratroprium nebs
        - add inhaled fluticasone
        - IV solumedrol at 125mg Q8h IV
   c) ? Pneumonia
 pt. recently treated with azithromycin & levofloxacin
   for PNA, now with GPCs in blood cultures
        - treat as below
   - follow ABG, sats if distress worsens
   # Bacteremia: Patient with GPCs in [**2-11**] bottles from admission blood
   cultures this morning.  Speciation pending.  Patient with recent
   hospitalizations.  Potential organisms include Clostridial species and
   Listeria.  Patient continues to have significant leukocytosis, although
   now on IV steroids, so this will cloud the picture.
   - Continue Vanc & Zosyn
   - Start Flagyl
   - f/u cultures, fever curve, WBC count
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - check hemolysis labs
   - check blood smear
   # Heart Rate: Initially was bradycardic, likely secondary to diltiazem
   toxicity and decreased renal function.  Is on Atenolol 100, Nifedipine
   60, and Diltiazem 240 daily at home.  All of these meds were held
   initially.  Metoprolol 25 mg started last night and patient was
   tachycardic early this am.
   - increase metoprolol to 50 PO BID
   - Start diltiazem 30 PO QID
   - Continue telemetry monitoring
   # Blood pressure: Initially hypotensive on presentation now
   hypertensive with SBPs in 160s this am, likely due to holding of her
   home antihypertensive medication regimen.  Restarting as above.  Will
   gradually uptitrate given previous medication toxicity and concern for
   infection / possible sepsis based on positive blood culture.
   .
   #2 lactic acidosis: Nearly resolved.  Gap 14.  Possible etiologies
   include metformin or sepsis.  Lactate improved to 1.4.
   - hold metformin
   - treating for bacteremia
   .
   # Renal failure: Resolving, creatinine down to 1.4 from 2.1 on
   admission.  Pre-renal vs. \[**3-14**] to ATN while bradycardic.
   - follow Cr
   .
   # Afib: currently in sinus rhythm
   - coumadin was held as supertherapeutic on admission. 2.9 today, will
   consider restarting
   .
   # DM: Holding metformin & glipizide.  ISS was stopped when drip was
   d/c'd.  Blood sugars are elevated this am, likely secondary to holding
   of PO meds, infection, and steroids.
   - restart insulin sliding scale and uptitrate as appropriate

","The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. She presented with bradycardia, lactic acidosis, and low mean arterial pressure (MAP). She has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including respiratory distress, bacteremia, bradycardia, hypertension, lactic acidosis, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's respiratory distress is being treated with diuretics for volume overload/pulmonary edema, inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids for asthma, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.

Bacteremia is suspected due to gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in the blood cultures. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole has been started. Cultures will be monitored, and daily surveillance cultures will be taken.

The patient's heart rate was initially bradycardic, likely secondary to diltiazem toxicity and decreased renal function. Metoprolol has been started, and the dose will be increased. Diltiazem will be restarted at a lower dose.

The patient's blood pressure was initially hypotensive but is now hypertensive. Antihypertensive medications will be restarted and gradually uptitrated.

Lactic acidosis is nearly resolved, and possible etiologies include metformin or sepsis. Metform"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female admit to ICU with respiratory failure with an evolution
   over time of clearly having signficiant and intermittent pulmonary
   edema noted.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
This is quite clearly related to intermittent
   pulmonary edema.  This edema may well trigger bronchospasm and
   worsening respiratory distress but with the rapid resolution and
   findings on CXR of edema without hyperinflation is consistent with
   this.
   -Maintain BIPAP overnight
   -Continue with rate pressure product control and minimize afterload
   -Will also need to keep the heart rate stable with Diltiazem
   -Will D/C systemic steroids given rapid resolution of respiratory
   distress/respiratory alkalosis
   -Return to baseline steroid dosing for chronic support
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   -Continue with Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl as positive blood cultures present
   -Will continue until final cultures have returned
   -This is atypical picture for sepsis but we had hypotension, lactic
   acidosis, Dopamine requirement upon admission is all consistent and on
   antibiotics we have had improvement and evidence of resolution of
   Sepsis and will await final speciation of organisms for determination
   of final course.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to intermittent pulmonary edema. The note also mentions several other conditions and medical interventions, including:

1. C. difficile infection (C. diff colitis, Clostridium difficile): The patient is being treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl. Positive blood cultures indicate the presence of C. difficile, and treatment will continue until final cultures return.

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient is experiencing metabolic acidosis, which may be related to the C. difficile infection or other underlying conditions.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently showing signs of acute renal failure. Antibiotics such as Zosyn and Flagyl are being used to treat the infection.

4. Atrial flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, for which she is being given Diltiazem to control her heart rate.

5. ICU care: The patient is receiving various ICU interventions, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and monitoring with arterial and central venous lines. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are also being implemented.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions and interventions include worsening respiratory distress, sepsis, further deterioration of renal function, cardiac arrhythmias"
