   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Came to ED with fatigue, weakness. Noted to be tachypneic in the ED.
   CTA obtained, which showed multiple pulmonary emboli. After
   consultation with neuro-oncologist, decision made to start
   anti-coagulation.
   This AM, nurses were a bit concerned about his mental status. Patient
   slightly confused. More sleepy through the early morning.
   Patient complaining of mild respiratory distress.

   1) Pulmonary embolism
   2) Metastatic melanoma
   3) Hypocalcemia
   Patient with bilateral pulmonary emboli. On heparin now, with concern
   about potential bleeding into CNS metastases. He is not a very good
   candidate for long term anticoagulation. Need to consider placement of
   IVC filter prior to discharge. Maintain PTT between 60-80. Has been
   hemodynamically stable.
   Oxygenation good on minimal supplemental oxygen.
   No evidence of seizures.
   Calcium down this AM for unclear reasons. Would recheck.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with metastatic melanoma to the brain. He presents with difficulty ambulating and was found to have multiple pulmonary embolisms (PE). The patient continues to deny any respiratory symptoms and has a minimal oxygen requirement. He is currently receiving heparin IV for treatment of PE. 

The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to increased steroid doses over the past few days. There is no evidence of infection, as the patient remains afebrile without other symptoms. The patient's difficulty ambulating is likely a result of his underlying diagnosis, possible neurologic spread, and/or hypoxia. Physical therapy has been consulted and will see the patient on the floor.

The patient has metastatic melanoma with brain mets and is currently not undergoing therapy. He requires ICU monitoring for proclivity of mets to bleed. There are no current neural deficits, but the patient has been discussed with the family regarding making him DNR/DNI and possibly moving toward hospice. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98.1Â°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/79 mmHg to 139/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with metastatic melanoma to the brain. He presents with difficulty ambulating and has multiple pulmonary embolisms (PE). The patient denies any respiratory symptoms and has minimal oxygen requirements. He is currently receiving heparin IV for anticoagulation and may require an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient's mental status is altered, but not due to delirium. He is experiencing tremors and has a history of melanoma with brain metastases. The family has made the decision to make the patient do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI), and they are considering a palliative care consult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - The patient has multiple PE's likely secondary to malignancy. Monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory symptoms and continuing with heparin therapy is important.
2. Difficulty ambulating - The patient reports feeling weak and experiencing unsteadiness, which could be due to underlying conditions, possible neurological spread, and/or hypoxia. Physical therapy consultation and monitoring for falls are recommended.
3. Metastatic melanoma with brain metastases - The patient's cancer is advanced, and there is a risk of neurological deterioration. Regular neurologic checks, further imaging if necessary, and consideration of neuro consultation and palliative care are important.
4. DVT - As the patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with metastatic melanoma, presenting with difficulty ambulating and multiple pulmonary embolisms (PEs). He has altered mental status, brain metastases, and is currently not undergoing therapy for his melanoma. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires oxygen supplementation. He has a history of tremors and denies any respiratory symptoms. His labs show slightly elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, while other values are within normal range. The patient's condition is being monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has multiple PE's, which can lead to further respiratory complications such as hypoxia, tachypnea, and even respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's known melanoma brain metastases have a propensity to become hemorrhagic. Anticoagulation therapy, such as heparin, should be carefully considered and monitored to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate level may indicate possible infection or sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms is necessary to detect and manage any potential infections.
4. Neurological Decline: The patient's altered mental status and brain metastases increase the risk of neurological decline, including seizures and worsening neurologic deficits. Neurological consultation and imaging may be needed for further evaluation and management."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and malignant melanoma. The patient's mental status remains depressed, but it has improved compared to before. The patient is hemodynamically stable and is on IV heparin. Oxygen therapy is being attempted to be weaned off today.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is slightly elevated but within acceptable limits, blood pressure is stable, respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 95%. 

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, well-nourished, overweight/obese, and no signs of edema or pallor in the eyes. Cardiovascular examination reveals a normal PMI and no murmurs. Respiratory examination shows crackles at the right base, and abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing, and the skin is warm without any rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, follows simple commands, oriented to person, place, and time, and has purposeful movements.

Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but elevated levels of LDH and ALT are noted. Other lab results such as PT/PTT/INR, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with metastatic melanoma to the brain, presenting with difficulty ambulating and multiple pulmonary embolisms. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring due to the high risk of bleeding associated with the spread of metastatic melanoma. The patient's condition is being managed with various medications and interventions, including heparin IV for pulmonary embolism, steroids for leukocytosis, and monitoring for hypoxia. The patient has been made DNR/DNI and the family is considering moving towards hospice care. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/76 to 147/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 6.6 to 18.3 K/uL, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's neurologic examination is grossly intact, but there are signs of metastatic melanoma with brain mets.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has multiple pulmonary embolisms likely secondary to malignancy. Close monitoring and systemic anticoagulation with heparin are being used to manage this condition. Potential complications include further embolic events or pulmonary hypertension."

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of pulmonary embolism and metastatic melanoma. The patient's oxygen levels decreased last night, and heparin was adjusted based on PTT. He is afebrile and experiencing mild dyspnea. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged except for the noted events. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/77 mmHg to 147/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has sinus rhythm and is well-nourished with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal systems. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive and follows simple commands. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The assessment and plan include altered mental status, pulmonary embolism, and metastatic melanoma. The patient is responding well to heparin therapy, with improved mental status and no evidence of further embolization. Antibiotics will be started due to salmonella in the stool.
