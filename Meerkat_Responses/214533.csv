","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient had wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM prior to the cardiac arrest, which could suggest an arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation. It is important to monitor the patient on telemetry and perform serial ECGs to detect any further arrhythmias.

2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): Despite having a normal stress test two weeks prior, the patient's ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes raise concerns for CAD. A cardiac catheterization is planned to rule out CAD.

3. Seizure and mental status changes: The patient experienced a possible seizure and subsequent mental status changes. A neurology consult is scheduled to evaluate for seizure and assess cortical function upon sedation withdrawal.

4. Fever and infection: The patient has been febrile to 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit and has an elevated white blood cell count. Although there are no signs of infection on chest X-ray and urinalysis, it is important to follow up with these tests and monitor for any signs of infection. Aspiration pneumonia vs. aspiration pneumonitis are considerations.

5. Alcohol abuse and withdrawal: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve, who experienced a cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may have been caused by various factors such as arrhythmia (VFib specifically), seizure, stroke with AFib, or ischemia. Telemetry monitoring, serial ECGs, and cardiac catheterization have been ordered to further evaluate and rule out these possibilities.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Despite having a normal stress test two weeks prior, the patient presented with ECG changes, elevated Troponin I, and CK levels, which raised suspicion for CAD. Cardiac catheterization has been scheduled to assess for CAD.
3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient is experiencing left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology on ECG, but has had right bundle branch block (RBBB) in previous ECGs. He also has extensive ectopy. Normal electrolytes have been checked, and no signs of ischemia are observed. An echocardiogram has been ordered to assess for any wall motion abnormalities. An electrophysiology (EP) consult has been scheduled.
4. Fever: The patient was found down and underwent cooling protocol. His WBC count was"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - Unclear etiology, but patient was having
   wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM. The preciptiant of the cardiac
   arrest is still unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia (VFib
   specificallY) or seizure. Stroke with AFib is another posibility, but
   we cannot assess any deficits a this time given sedation.  Also
   possible it could be ischemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Serial ECGs
   - Trend CE
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**]: cardiac cath today to r/o CAD
   - Neurology consult today re: ?seizure
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with normal stress test 2 weeks prior, multiple ECG
   changes (right and left bunndle as above), Trop I of 2.24 and CK of
   ~5500 with negative MBI. He does not have any risk factors, was not on
   aspirin and did not have chest pain. This makes unlikley that he has
   CAD as presenting symptom.
   - Cardiac cath today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Trend CE
   - Serial ECGs
   - Continue Metorpolol (increased to 50mg po/ng TID)
   - On simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - No indications for ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 284**] given not known CAD and most-likley
   increased CE after CPR
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Plavix load given
   - Plavix 75 mg daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt currently with LBBB morphology, but RBBB in multiple
   ECGs at other hospital. Pt also has extensive ectopy. At this time his
   electrolytes are normal. No signs of ischemia. Dilated heart in
   echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF, bicuspid AS and mixomatous
   degeneration of mitral valve. [**Month (only) 11**] be going in and out of Atrial
   Fibrilation.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 50 mg TID for now
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   - Echcoardiogram in AM to assess for WMA
   - EP consult in AM
   - Discuss anticoagulation for AFib, poor candidate given EtOH. Will
   hold until CT scan negative.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #. Fever - Pt was found down and s/p cooling protocol. WBC was high up
   to 14,000. No signs of infection on CXR and UA clean at OSH. Concern
   for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. Given no infiltrates
   will hold on antibiotics for now. Withdrawal is another consideration.
   Febrile to 100.6 last night.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Blood cultures
   - No antibiotics for now
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse - Pt with last drink 4 days ago. Has been getting
   ativan and valium. No signs of withdrawal at this time (HR, BP
   adequte), but difficult to assess given beta-blocker and sedated.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis in the
   settinf of code and being found down.
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   .
   #. Hematuria - Resolved. Most likely traumatic after Foley placement.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest with unclear etiology, possibly due to wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM. Etiologies suggest arrhythmia (VFib specifically) or seizure. Stroke with AFib is another possibility, but it cannot be assessed at this time due to sedation. Ischemia is also a consideration.

2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has multiple ECG changes, elevated cardiac enzymes (Trop I of 2.24 and CK of ~5500), and a negative MBI. He does not have any risk factors, was not on aspirin, and did not have chest pain. This makes it unlikely that CAD is the presenting symptom. However, cardiac catheterization is recommended to rule out CAD.

3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient currently has LBBB morphology but has had RBBB in multiple ECGs at other hospitals. The patient also has extensive ectopy. With normal electrolytes and no signs of ischemia, the patient's dilated heart with preserved EF, bicuspid AS, and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration should be further evaluated. Serial ECGs, telemetry monitoring, and an echocardiogram are planned to assess for any worsening of rhythm disturbances, particularly atrial fibrillation.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest.
- The patient was having wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM, and the cause of the cardiac arrest is still unclear.
- The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes and liver function tests.
- He is intubated and on ventilatory support.
- The patient has a fever of 100.6°F and no signs of infection on chest X-ray and urinalysis.
- There are concerns about aspiration pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis.
- The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is being monitored for possible withdrawal symptoms.
- His liver function tests indicate possible shock liver or ischemic hepatitis.
- The patient has resolved hematuria, which was likely due to Foley catheter placement.
- The patient has been prescribed prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of MVP, bicuspid aortic valve, and recent cardiac arrest, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or ischemic heart disease.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count raise concerns for potential"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro Recs: Though the etiology of patient's collapse and cardiac
   arrest remain unclear, primary arrythmia is of great concern. Given
   patient's history and presentation, his decreased mental status does
   not appear to be the primary event. His cardiac arrest and head trauma
   put him at significant risk for anoxic brain injury.
      - follow up CT head and neck to assess extent of trauma (rule out
   brain contusion    and delayed hemorrhage)
     - recommend continuous EEG monitoring to evaluate for nonconvulsive
   seizure   activity
      - minimize sedating medications for more accurate neurologic exams
   - EP Recs: If neuro status improves could consider EPS and then
   reconsider ICD . Continue to rate control, ASA.
   - ABG 10:30pm: (7.46/35/118 on AC Tv:500 RR: 16 PEEP: 5 Fi02: 40%). No
   vent changes made.
   - CT Head Final: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 988**]-white differentiation with
   effacement of the sulci and ventricles. Given clinical history, this is
   likely to reflect edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. MRI is
   recommended for further characterization as clinically indicated.
   - CT Neck Final: 1. No evidence for fracture or acute malalignment
   involving the cervical spine. 2. Mild-to- moderate cervical spondylosis
   causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
   - Cxs: No growth to date, pending.
   - Increased ectopy last night. Gave 40 KCL, rechecked lytes (K 4.0).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits a this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   -EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**1-13**].
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These complications include:

1. Neurological complications: The patient has a decreased mental status and a CT scan showing signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. This suggests a risk for ongoing neurological dysfunction, which may progress to permanent brain damage if not properly managed.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of MVP (mitral valve prolapse) and bicuspid aortic valve, and there were episodes of ectopy/NSVT (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia). These findings indicate an increased risk for arrhythmias, which could lead to further cardiac events such as recurrent cardiac arrest or heart failure.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) versus aspiration pneumonitis, and further evaluation with U/A (urinalysis), CXR (chest X-ray), sputum cultures, and blood cultures is recommended. Additionally, the patient has a left-to-right shunt, most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, which may require further characterization with an MRI.

4. Infectious complications: The patient has fevers, but no leukocytosis. It is important to monitor for potential infections and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy as per the current regimen.

5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits a this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**1-13**].
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He was transferred for further evaluation. The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Neurological status: The patient is unresponsive and not sedated. He has slightly reactive pupils, normal muscle mass (MMM), and pink conjunctiva without pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The patient does not respond to sternal rub, withdrawal to pain, or following commands. Spontaneous eye movement and corneal reflex are present. Normal tone in all four extremities.
- Cardiac status: The patient has a preserved ejection fraction (EF) and a dilated heart on echocardiogram. He has a bicuspid aortic valve and mitral valve with mixedomatous degeneration. The patient experienced wide-complex tachycardia at 220 beats per minute, which could be ventricular fibrillation (VFib). There is a possibility of stroke with atrial fibrillation (AFib), but it cannot be assessed due to the patient's unresponsiveness.
- Fever: The patient has low-grade fevers. It is uncertain whether it represents aspiration pneumonia (PNA) or aspiration pneumonitis. There is no leukocytosis, and the patient responds well to Tylenol.
- Left to right shunt: It is likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary"

   Chief Complaint: Intubated s/p cardiac arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro Recs: Though the etiology of patient's collapse and cardiac
   arrest remain unclear, primary arrythmia is of great concern. Given
   patient's history and presentation, his decreased mental status does
   not appear to be the primary event. His cardiac arrest and head trauma
   put him at significant risk for anoxic brain injury.
      - follow up CT head and neck to assess extent of trauma (rule out
   brain contusion    and delayed hemorrhage)
     - recommend continuous EEG monitoring to evaluate for nonconvulsive
   seizure   activity
      - minimize sedating medications for more accurate neurologic exams
   - EP Recs: If neuro status improves could consider EPS and then
   reconsider ICD . Continue to rate control, ASA.
   - ABG 10:30pm: (7.46/35/118 on AC Tv:500 RR: 16 PEEP: 5 Fi02: 40%). No
   vent changes made.
   - CT Head Final: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 988**]-white differentiation with
   effacement of the sulci and ventricles. Given clinical history, this is
   likely to reflect edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. MRI is
   recommended for further characterization as clinically indicated.
   - CT Neck Final: 1. No evidence for fracture or acute malalignment
   involving the cervical spine. 2. Mild-to- moderate cervical spondylosis
   causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
   - Cxs: No growth to date, pending.
   - Increased ectopy last night with stimulation. Gave 40 KCL, rechecked
   lytes (K 4.0). Improved. Early morning again with increased ectopy.
   Gave another 40 KCL and increased Metroprolol to 75mg TID.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is being intubated after a cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of MVP (mitral valve prolapse) and a bicuspid aortic valve. 

24-hour events:
- Neurological assessment: The patient's mental status does not appear to be the primary event, but there is a concern for anoxic brain injury due to cardiac arrest and head trauma. A CT scan of the head shows diffuse loss of white differentiation with effacement of the sulci and ventricles, likely reflecting edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. An MRI is recommended for further characterization.
- Electrolyte imbalance: The patient experienced increased ectopy last night with stimulation, which improved after administering 40 KCL. Another episode of increased ectopy occurred early morning, and the patient was given another 40 KCL and increased metoprolol to 75mg TID.
- Cardiac enzymes: There is an elevation in cardiac enzymes, indicating possible myocardial injury or infarction.
- Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, but no leukocytosis. The fever may represent aspiration pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis. It is unclear whether this is due to withdrawal in a patient with a history of ethanol abuse or not. Further investigation is needed, including a follow-up urinalysis, chest X-ray, sputum cultures, and blood cultures. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin"

   Chief Complaint: Intubated s/p cardiac arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro Recs: Though the etiology of patient's collapse and cardiac
   arrest remain unclear, primary arrythmia is of great concern. Given
   patient's history and presentation, his decreased mental status does
   not appear to be the primary event. His cardiac arrest and head trauma
   put him at significant risk for anoxic brain injury.
      - follow up CT head and neck to assess extent of trauma (rule out
   brain contusion    and delayed hemorrhage)
     - recommend continuous EEG monitoring to evaluate for nonconvulsive
   seizure   activity
      - minimize sedating medications for more accurate neurologic exams
   - EP Recs: If neuro status improves could consider EPS and then
   reconsider ICD . Continue to rate control, ASA.
   - ABG 10:30pm: (7.46/35/118 on AC Tv:500 RR: 16 PEEP: 5 Fi02: 40%). No
   vent changes made.
   - CT Head Final: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 988**]-white differentiation with
   effacement of the sulci and ventricles. Given clinical history, this is
   likely to reflect edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. MRI is
   recommended for further characterization as clinically indicated.
   - CT Neck Final: 1. No evidence for fracture or acute malalignment
   involving the cervical spine. 2. Mild-to- moderate cervical spondylosis
   causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
   - Cxs: No growth to date, pending.
   - Increased ectopy last night with stimulation. Gave 40 KCL, rechecked
   lytes (K 4.0). Improved. Early morning again with increased ectopy.
   Gave another 40 KCL and increased Metroprolol to 75mg TID.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift. Presence of muscle fasiculations and involuntary movements of
   unclear etiology, but possibly due to central neurological injuries.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**1-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. The patient has been intubated and is currently in the ICU. 

The patient's neuro status remains unchanged with decreased mental status, and there is concern for anoxic brain injury due to cardiac arrest and head trauma. Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended to evaluate for nonconvulsive seizure activity, and minimizing sedating medications is advised for more accurate neurological exams.

The patient has shown episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which responded well to IV boluses of K+. Metoprolol has been increased to 75 mg TID, and further evaluation by electrophysiologists is suggested if these episodes become more frequent or stop responding to K+ boluses.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/73 to 142/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

   - ABG at 1400: 7.50/33/127/27/3 on CPAP 10/5, RT thought we should
   leave patient on CPAP at this time as neuro status is likely driving
   breathing and seems comfortable on CPAP; no indication for AC
   - Could not get MRI as patient has an implant in his ear and rads
   cannot characterize the model based on CT/plain films.  Radiology/neuro
   does not feel it's work risking his hearing to get MRI.  Repeat CT
   today which showed (per resident read): No hemorrhage or infarc,
   persistent diffuse loss of grey-white differentiation, soft tissue
   edema improved.  Overal impression: no interval change. (need to f/u
   final read)
   - Neuro still monitoring EEG, no evidence of seizures at this time.
   Feel that patient's condition stable at this time, difficult to judge
   improvement.
   - Urine benzos neg, TSH and B12 normal, ammonia pending

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift. Presence of muscle fasiculations and involuntary movements of
   unclear etiology, but possibly due to central neurological injuries.
   r/o other causes of encephalopathy
all tests negative. B12, TSH, NH3
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -will plan for family meeting today with wife and [**Name2 (NI) 7435**] ([**Name (NI) 1795**] and
   Neuro attending)
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**2-10**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve, who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. The patient was transferred for further workup.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest - The cause of the cardiac arrest is still unclear. Possible etiologies include arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM (VFib specifically), or stroke with atrial fibrillation. Telemetry monitoring is recommended. Further investigation and treatment should be delayed until neurological recovery.
2. Neurological Status - There is no improvement in the patient's neurological status despite being off sedation for 48 hours. A CT scan showed signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements may be due to central neurological injuries. Other causes of encephalopathy should be ruled out.
3. Fever - The patient has had low-grade fevers. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. There is no leukocytosis. The patient responds well to Tylenol. It is unlikely to represent withdrawal in a patient with a history of EtOH abuse because there are no signs of hypertension or tachycardia.
4. Rhythm Disturbances - The patient has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT. These episodes have responded well to IV boluses of"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ABG at 1400: 7.50/33/127/27/3 on CPAP 10/5, RT thought we should
   leave patient on CPAP at this time as neuro status is likely driving
   breathing and seems comfortable on CPAP; no indication for AC
   - Could not get MRI as patient has an implant in his ear and rads
   cannot characterize the model based on CT/plain films.  Radiology/neuro
   does not feel it's work risking his hearing to get MRI.  Repeat CT
   today which showed (per resident read): No hemorrhage or infarc,
   persistent diffuse loss of grey-white differentiation, soft tissue
   edema improved.  Overal impression: no interval change. (need to f/u
   final read)
   - Neuro still monitoring EEG, no evidence of seizures at this time.
   Feel that patient's condition stable at this time, difficult to judge
   improvement.
   - Urine benzos neg, TSH and B12 normal, ammonia pending
   - Patient's family would like meeting with neurology and CCU team.
   Wife will be here from 1pm until 8pm tomorrow.  Need to page neuro
   ([**Doctor First Name 7434**]) in the am and ask her to come to meeting with wife in
   afternoon.

   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift. Presence of muscle fasiculations and involuntary movements of
   unclear etiology, but possibly due to central neurological injuries.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -will plan for family meeting today with wife and [**Name2 (NI) 7435**] ([**Name (NI) 1795**] and
   Neuro attending)
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**2-10**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition is unresponsive, and he is being monitored in the ICU. The patient has been off sedation for 48 hours but has shown no improvement in neurological status. A CT scan revealed signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. The patient is on CPAP and has been responding well to it. There are concerns regarding potential medical complications such as fever, rhythm disturbances, dilated heart, and left-to-right shunt.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, which may indicate aspiration pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Further investigation is needed, including urinalysis, chest X-ray, sputum cultures, and blood cultures.
2. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has experienced episodes of ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). These episodes have responded well to intravenous boluses of potassium. Monitoring for atrial fibrillation is also recommended.
3. Dilated heart: The patient's echocardiogram showed a dilated heart despite preserved ejection fraction. This may be related to the patient's history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Left-to-right shunt:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   Unresponsive
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. 3L positive length of stay.
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, -500 cc today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  r/o other causes of
   encephalopathy
all tests negative. B12, TSH, NH3
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -Will d/w neuro and family possibility of MRI/MRA as patient may be a
   candidate now.
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**3-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: monitoring neuro status with plans
   as per above

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He was transferred for further workup.
- The patient is currently unresponsive and has been off sedation for 72 hours.
- Neurological status has shown some improvement with minor withdrawal to pain and more EEG activity.
- A CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.
- There are muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, possibly due to central neurological injuries.
- Other causes of encephalopathy have been ruled out with negative tests.
- There is a possibility of a posterior circulation distribution abnormality and further investigation is recommended.
- The patient underwent a Right Stapedectomy with a prosthetic stapes implant about 10 years ago. The brand of the prosthetic is unclear, and there may be complications if it is incompatible with an MRI.
- The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and has responded well to Tylenol for fevers. Sputum cultures and blood cultures have been ordered.
- The patient has episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to IV boluses of K+. Metoprolol was increased from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID.
- A dilated heart was seen on"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Family Meeting: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] and Neuro hopeful. Will monitor over weekend
   and re-assess function beginning of week.
   - Simvastatin DC'd and Vancomycin DC'd
   - CT Head final: Prelim without significant change from previous.
   Neuro: EEG suggests a moderate to severe encephalopathy involving
   cortical and subcortical structures. Additionally, posterior
   parasagittal suppression suggests a posterior circulation distribution
   abnormalitiy and may warrant further investigation. Overall, this
   record is slightly improved from the previous 24 hours due to the
   increase in frequency of the background rhythm. NO electrographic
   seizures were noted
   - Spoke with ENT physician in RI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7448**]) patient had
   Right Stapedectomy with a prosthetic stapes implant about 10 years ago
   (NO COCHLEAR IMPLANT! RADIOLOGY REPORT WAS INCORRECT!); He had a McGee
   Piston prosthetic that is likely MRI compatible.
   There is one brand made in [**2136**] that is not compatible, and not sure
   which brand patient has. So...radiology is willing to do an MRI on
   patient with proper consent if an MRI is needed. There are 2
   complications that the family must know. If patient has the one brand
   that is incompatible: 1. Deafness (wife says patient is already deaf in
   that ear...) 2. Disruption of oval window that can cause a fluid leak,
   and surgery will need to fix this. If family is willing to agree to
   these potential complications, than radiology will perform the MRI.
   - Will contact Neuro and let them know.
   - Increased metoprolol to 100 TID b/c of increased ectopy

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   Unresponsive
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  r/o other causes of
   encephalopathy
all tests negative. B12, TSH, NH3
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -Will d/w neuro and family possibility of MRI/MRA as patient may be a
   candidate now.
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**3-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and a bicuspid aortic valve, who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. He was transferred for further workup. The patient is currently unresponsive.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The cause of the cardiac arrest is still unclear, with possibilities including arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM (VFib specifically), or stroke with atrial fibrillation.

2. Stroke: There may be a suggestion of a posterior cerebral artery infarct on EEG.

3. Infection: The patient has a fever and concern for aspiration pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. No leukocytosis is present, but cultures have been ordered.

4. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has had episodes of ectopy/non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which have responded well to IV boluses of potassium. There is also a discussion of possible atrial fibrillation.

5. Left to right shunt: This is most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return. An MRI is recommended to further characterize, but it is not possible with intubation.

6. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient had minimal CAD on catheterization, and his statin medication has been stopped due to clean coronaries and a low LDL cholesterol level.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3L positive length of stay.   Ge started Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday but did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   - Standing Lasix 40mg po BID to diurese, as receiving tube feeds and
   not self-diuresing
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this tomorrow to assess neuro
   status
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. WBC
   increased to 11.3 today.  Febrile to 100.2 in last 24 hours and with
   low-grade fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent
   withdrawal in pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or
   tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora, last chest xray [**6-27**]
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**4-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. 

1. Neurological Status: The patient remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement in their neurological status over the past week. There is a possibility of anoxic brain injury, muscle fasciculations, and involuntary movements due to central neurological injuries. An MRI/MRA has been consented by the family to assess the neuro status.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The cause of the cardiac arrest is still unclear, with possibilities including arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM (VFib specifically), or stroke with AFib. Further investigation is needed once the patient's neurological status improves.

3. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers and an increased WBC count, suggesting a possible infection such as pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Sputum cultures and blood cultures have been ordered, and levofloxacin has been continued for a total of 7 days.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3L positive length of stay.   Ge started Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday but did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   - Standing Lasix 40mg po BID to diurese, as receiving tube feeds and
   not self-diuresing
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this tomorrow to assess neuro
   status
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. WBC
   increased to 11.3 today.  Febrile to 100.2 in last 24 hours and with
   low-grade fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent
   withdrawal in pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or
   tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora, last chest xray [**6-27**]
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**4-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI tomorrow.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest, possibly due to wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM (VFib) or stroke with AFib. He remains minimally responsive and intubated. The patient's neurological status has shown some improvement over the past week. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever and increased white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source and appropriate treatment.

2. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which responded well to IV boluses of K+. Increased ectopy overnight and the possibility of AFib should be monitored closely.

3. Left to Right Shunt: The patient has a left to right shunt, most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return. An MRI is recommended to further characterize the condition.

4. Cervical spine injury: Although the CT scan showed no evidence of fracture, there is a concern for ligamentous injury. Continuous collar immobilization is recommended until the neck is cleared, either through MRI or clinical evaluation.

5. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, but no signs of withdrawal are currently present. Monitoring for any signs of withdrawal and providing appropriate care is important.

6. Liver injury:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP (mitral valve prolapse) and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. The patient remains minimally responsive and intubated. The note outlines several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The cause of the cardiac arrest is still unclear, with possible etiologies including arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM (VFib specifically), or stroke with AFib. The patient has been on Lasix 20mg IV x 2, but did not meet the goal of -500 cc output. The plan includes monitoring on telemetry, standing Lasix 40mg po BID to diurese, and waiting for further investigation/tx until neurological recovery.

2. Neurological Status: There has been an improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to pain and more EEG activity; the patient is off sedation for 72 hours. A CT scan showed signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. The presence of muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology is being investigated. Other causes of encephalopathy have been ruled out. The plan includes following up on prognosis, obtaining an MRI/MRA to assess neuro status, continuing to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, and response to stimuli.

3. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever of 100.2 in the last 24 hours, which may be due to aspiration PNA (pneumonia) or aspiration pneumonitis. The white blood cell count has increased to 11.3 today. Sputum cultures, oral flora, and blood cultures are recommended. Levofloxacin will be continued for a total of 7 days.

4. Rhythm: The patient has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT (non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) last night and this morning, which responded well to IV boluses of K+. There was an initial discussion of possible atrial fibrillation, but no episodes have occurred since admission. The plan includes repleting electrolytes PRN, increasing metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID, and serial ECGs.

5. Left to Right Shunt: A most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return is suspected, and an MRI is recommended to further characterize the condition. A TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of intracardiac shunting. If the patient awakens, a cardiac MRI is suggested.

6. CAD (coronary artery disease): The patient has minimal CAD, and the plan includes stopping simvastatin 20mg po daily due to clean coronaries and LDLc being 91. Metoprolol 100mg po/ng T"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3L positive length of stay.   Ge started Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday but did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   - Standing Lasix 40mg po BID to diurese, as receiving tube feeds and
   not self-diuresing
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this tomorrow to assess neuro
   status
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. WBC
   increased to 11.3 today.  Febrile to 100.2 in last 24 hours and with
   low-grade fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent
   withdrawal in pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or
   tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora, last chest xray [**6-27**]
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**4-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest. He was intubated and remains minimally responsive. The patient has shown some improvement in neurological status over the past week. He has a past medical history of possible seizure, cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests, and alcohol abuse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The cause of the cardiac arrest is still unclear, with possible etiologies including arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM (VFib specifically), or stroke with atrial fibrillation. The patient's cardiac enzymes and liver function tests were elevated, indicating potential myocardial injury.
2. Neurological Status: The patient remains minimally responsive and unresponsive to commands. There is a suggestion of a posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarct on EEG. Further investigation, such as an MRI, is planned to assess neurological status.
3. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers and an increased white blood cell count, raising concern for aspiration pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis. Sputum cultures and blood cultures have been ordered.
4. Dilated Heart: The patient has a dilated heart in echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration. He has had episodes of ectopy/non-sust"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of
 500 cc- 1 Liter today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this today to assess neuro
   status
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point. WBC decreased to 9.6
   today.  Afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient
   appears to be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**5-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to increased metoprolol PVC
s and NSVT overnight; but
   maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy or stops
   responding to K boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around edge of
   cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI; Unable to
   assess sacrum as patient unable to move with cervical collar in place.
   - MRI today; if negative, will remove cervical collar and turn patient.
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI today.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP (mitral valve prolapse) and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a possible seizure and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient has been intubated and remains minimally responsive. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The cause of the cardiac arrest is still unclear, but possible etiologies include arrhythmia, specifically wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM (ventricular fibrillation), or a stroke with atrial fibrillation. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Neurological status: The patient shows slight improvement in neurological status over the past week, but remains unresponsive. There is a suggestion of a posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarct on the EEG. Monitoring and further investigation are required to assess any neurological deficits and potential recovery.

3. Fever: The patient had a fever, which could be due to aspiration pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. The white blood cell count has decreased, indicating a possible improvement. Sputum cultures have not yet identified an organism, and blood cultures are pending.

4. Rhythm: The patient has had episodes of ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) but has maintained sinus rhythm. Serial ECGs and telemetry monitoring are recommended.

5. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed a Stage"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest, leading to an elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement in neurological status over the past week.

The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by an arrhythmia, specifically ventricular fibrillation, although other etiologies such as stroke with atrial fibrillation are also possible. His neurological status is still guarded due to unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of posterior cerebral artery infarct on EEG.

The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration. He continues to have episodes of ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which have responded well to increased metoprolol.

The patient's respiratory status is appropriate for weaning, but given his depressed mental status, extubation is being held for now. There is a concern for left-to-right shunt, most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, which should be further characterized with an MRI.

The patient has developed a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar and is unable to remove it until a negative MRI is obtained. The patient's skin breakdown should be managed by frequent turning and ensuring appropriate low pressure bed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of
 500 cc- 1 Liter today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests.
- The patient remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement in neurological status over the past week.
- Possible etiologies for the cardiac arrest include arrhythmia (specifically ventricular fibrillation) and stroke with atrial fibrillation, although neurological deficits cannot be assessed due to unresponsiveness.
- The patient has received Lasix for fluid balance and has shown slight improvement.
- There are concerns regarding fever, rhythm disturbances, dilated heart, skin breakdown, respiratory failure, left to right shunt, and potential complications from alcohol abuse.
- The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), ranitidine, and metoprolol.
- Further investigations and treatments are recommended, including an MRI to assess neuro status, ongoing monitoring of electrolytes, ECGs, and telemetry.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmia: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ongoing rhythm disturbances indicate a potential risk for recurrent arrhythmias, which could lead to further cardiac events.
2. Stroke: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the possibility of a stroke during the cardiac arrest, there is a risk of ongoing neurological deficits or further neurological complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of even to +300 cc today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family has not officially consented for MRI/MRA with radiology; will
   contact radiology today to assess status of MRI/MRA today
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point.  Diaphoretic although,
   afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient appears to
   be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Last day of  Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is
   day [**6-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to increased metoprolol PVC
s and NSVT overnight; but
   maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy or stops
   responding to K boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around edge of
   cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI; Unable to
   assess sacrum as patient unable to move with cervical collar in place.
   - MRI today; if negative, will remove cervical collar and turn patient.
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI today.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement in neurological status over the past week. The patient's cardiac enzymes and liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible ischemic hepatitis or shock liver. There are concerns about potential complications such as arrhythmia, stroke, and sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is being monitored on telemetry. He has a positive blood culture, indicating an infection. The patient also has a pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar and is at risk for respiratory failure. Further investigations, including an MRI, are planned to assess for any underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmia: The patient had wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM during cardiac arrest, which may suggest ventricular fibrillation. This increases the risk of future arrhythmic events.
2. Stroke: The patient's unresponsiveness could be due to a stroke, especially considering his history of atrial fibrillation. A PCA infarct is suggested on the EEG, but further imaging is required to confirm.
3. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood culture indicates an infection. Given his immunocompromised state and elevated inflammatory markers, sepsis is a potential complication.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, who experienced a cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement in neurological status over the past week. The cause of the cardiac arrest is still unclear, with possible etiologies including arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia, or stroke. The patient has been diagnosed with anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift, muscle fasciculations, and involuntary movements of unclear etiology. There are concerns for aspiration pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis, and the patient's fever is being monitored. The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral valve prolapse. He is at risk for further complications such as skin breakdown, respiratory failure, left-to-right shunt, and cardiac issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Skin Breakdown: The patient has developed a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. It is important to remove the collar and turn the patient frequently to prevent further skin breakdown and assess the dorsum.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated on moderate settings, with an RSBI of 87. His lung status appears appropriate for weaning, but given his depressed mental status, extubation will be held for now. Consideration should"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He was transferred for further workup and remains minimally responsive and intubated. His neurological status has shown slight improvement over the past week.

The patient's cardiac enzymes and liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury or ischemic hepatitis. He also has dilated cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction and a history of mixed aortic valve disease. The patient has been experiencing episodes of ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which have responded well to increased metoprolol.

The patient's respiratory status is stable with an RSBI of 87, indicating that he is not ready for weaning from mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about potential aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, but no organism has been isolated yet. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased to 9.6 today, and he appears to be improving on the current antibiotic regimen.

The patient has a left-to-right shunt most likely due to anomalous pulmonary venous return, as indicated by the TTE showing aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of intracardiac shunting. An MRI is recommended to further characterize this condition.

   process noted per my read
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.  Neurology has
   discussed poor prognosis with the family, but recommends finishing a 24
   hour EEG monitoring for another assessment of his neuro status.
   - F/U 24 hour EEG results
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family meeting regarding decision of extubation vs Trach/PEG.  Wife
   has stated that the patient would not want to be sustained on a
   ventilator long-term.
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  He is 4.3L positive length of stay, +300ml over last 24
   hours. UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc.  Daily goal on
   this patient should be even to slightly positive, as he has many
   insensible losses with NG tube and ventilator.
   - Continue to give Lasix prn for uneven I/O
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - Monitor lytes every 3 days and replete as needed
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.
   Diaphoretic but remains afebrile. Responds well to tylenol.
   - Sputum Cultures showed oral flora
   - All blood cultures final with no growth
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Need to address whether patient needs Trach/PEG or will undergo
   extubation, as ETT tube causing ulceration in mouth and not able to
   give ideal mouth care
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but must first
   address goals of care after 24 hour EEG
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated > 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily stopped in preparation for possible Trach/PEG
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize pain
   .

   Disposition: CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Neurological status: The patient is minimally responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in neurological status since admission. There are signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift on the CT scan. The patient has also shown minor improvements in neurological status since admission. Ruling out other causes of encephalopathy, including B12, TSH, NH3, is recommended. A 24-hour EEG monitoring is advised for further assessment of neuro status.

2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias. He has positive fluid balance, and daily goals should be even to slightly positive due to insensible losses with NG tube and ventilator. Monitoring on telemetry and continuing Lasix prn for uneven I/O are recommended.

3. Pneumonia: The patient finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia. Although he remains afebrile, diaphoretic, and responds well to Tylenol, sputum cultures showed oral flora, and all blood cultures final with no growth.

4. Rhythm: The patient has a dilated heart on echocardiogram with preserved EF, bicuspid AS, and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration. He continues to have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which respond well to increased metoprolol. Maintaining sinus rhythm is"

   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.  Neurology has
   discussed poor prognosis with the family, but recommends finishing a 24
   hour EEG monitoring for another assessment of his neuro status.
   - F/U 24 hour EEG results
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family meeting regarding decision of extubation vs Trach/PEG.  Wife
   has stated that the patient would not want to be sustained on a
   ventilator long-term.
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  He is 4.3L positive length of stay, +300ml over last 24
   hours. UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc.  Daily goal on
   this patient should be even to slightly positive, as he has many
   insensible losses with NG tube and ventilator.
   - Continue to give Lasix prn for uneven I/O
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - Monitor lytes every 3 days and replete as needed
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.
   Diaphoretic but remains afebrile. Responds well to tylenol.
   - Sputum Cultures showed oral flora
   - All blood cultures final with no growth
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Need to address whether patient needs Trach/PEG or will undergo
   extubation, as ETT tube causing ulceration in mouth and not able to
   give ideal mouth care
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI
   attempted this morning but unable to do it due to fast RR and some
   blood-tinged sputum.
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but must first
   address goals of care after 24 hour EEG
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated > 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily stopped in preparation for possible Trach/PEG
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize pain

   Disposition: CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest and subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs. The patient remains minimally responsive and intubated, with no significant improvement in neurological status since admission.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Neurological complications: The patient has been off sedation for more than one week, and his CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. There is a guarded prognosis due to the lack of meaningful responsiveness. Monitoring physical exam, responsiveness, and response to stimuli is recommended.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias. Telemetry monitoring should continue, and Lasix should be given as needed for uneven I/O. Daily goals should aim for even to slightly positive fluid balance, considering insensible losses from the NG tube and ventilator.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia. Since the sputum cultures showed oral flora and all blood cultures had no growth, further investigation or treatment may not be necessary at this time.
4. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased metoprolol. Telemetry monitoring should continue, and electrolytes should be repleted as needed.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient is developing"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
#Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status sin
ce admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He has been off sedatio
n for more than one week and his CT shows signs of anoxic brain injury without h
emorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other causes of encephalopathy including B12
, TSH, NH3.  Second video EEG without change, no seizure activity.
   - Family meeting, discuss code status and plan.
   .
   # Comfort Measures: After family is prepared for extubation we will dc
   cervical collar and metoprolol and provide morphine gtt.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.
   -          DC Telemetry.
   -          At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - DC Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - DC cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI
   120 this morning.
   -Extubation after family has had a chance to visit.
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - No intervention at this time.
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest, resulting in an elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. He was transferred for further evaluation and remains minimally responsive and intubated. There have been minor improvements in his neurological status since admission, but he is still not meaningfully responsive. His CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift, ruling out other causes of encephalopathy. The second video EEG showed no seizure activity. The family is preparing for extubation, and comfort measures will be provided after the family is prepared. The patient is also being treated for pneumonia, rhythm disturbances, skin breakdown, respiratory failure, left-to-right shunt, and coronary artery disease. There are no signs of heart failure at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated on moderate settings, and his RSBI is 120 this morning. The plan is to extubate after the family has had a chance to visit.
2. Skin Breakdown: The patient is developing mouth ulcers secondary to the endotracheal tube and has a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. Measures to prevent further skin breakdown include giving orabase solution, frequent turning, and ensuring an appropriate low-pressure bed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.  Neurology has
   discussed poor prognosis with the family, but recommends finishing a 24
   hour EEG monitoring for another assessment of his neuro status.
   - F/U 24 hour EEG results
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family meeting regarding decision of extubation vs Trach/PEG.  Wife
   has stated that the patient would not want to be sustained on a
   ventilator long-term.
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  He is 4.3L positive length of stay, +300ml over last 24
   hours. UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc.  Daily goal on
   this patient should be even to slightly positive, as he has many
   insensible losses with NG tube and ventilator.
   - Continue to give Lasix prn for uneven I/O
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - Monitor lytes every 3 days and replete as needed
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.
   Diaphoretic but remains afebrile. Responds well to tylenol.
   - Sputum Cultures showed oral flora
   - All blood cultures final with no growth
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Need to address whether patient needs Trach/PEG or will undergo
   extubation, as ETT tube causing ulceration in mouth and not able to
   give ideal mouth care
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI
   attempted this morning but unable to do it due to fast RR and some
   blood-tinged sputum.
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but must first
   address goals of care after 24 hour EEG
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated > 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily stopped in preparation for possible Trach/PEG
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize pain

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced cardiac arrest and subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in neurological status since admission. The patient's CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Other causes of encephalopathy have been ruled out.

The patient's current medical conditions include cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias, pneumonia (finished a course of levofloxacin), dilated heart with preserved EF, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration. He continues to have episodes of ectopy/NSVT but responds well to increased metoprolol. His rhythm has been maintained in sinus rhythm.

The patient has developed mouth ulcers secondary to the endotracheal tube and stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. He is also at risk for respiratory failure and has a left-to-right shunt most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return. An MRI is recommended to further characterize the shunt.

The patient's cardiac catheterization showed minimal CAD, and his coronary arteries are clean. He has been on ASA 325 mg daily but will stop it in preparation for possible tracheostomy/PEG.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
#Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status sin
ce admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He has been off sedatio
n for more than one week and his CT shows signs of anoxic brain injury without h
emorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other causes of encephalopathy including B12
, TSH, NH3.  Second video EEG without change, no seizure activity.
   - Extubate today.
   .
   # Comfort Measures: After family is prepared for extubation we will dc
   cervical collar and metoprolol and provide morphine gtt.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
#Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status sin
ce admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He has been off sedatio
n for more than one week and his CT shows signs of anoxic brain injury without h
emorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other causes of encephalopathy including B12
, TSH, NH3.  Second video EEG without change, no seizure activity.
   - Extubate today.
   .
   # Comfort Measures: After family is prepared for extubation we will dc
   cervical collar and metoprolol and provide morphine gtt.
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN, Consider changing to gtt
   - Palliative care consult

   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.
   -          DC Telemetry.
   -          At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.

   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - DC metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - DC cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.
   -Extubation today

   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.

#Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status sin
ce admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He has been off sedatio
n for more than one week and his CT shows signs of anoxic brain injury without h
emorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other causes of encephalopathy including B12
, TSH, NH3.  Second video EEG without change, no seizure activity.
   - Extubate today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest and subsequently had elevated cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. The patient remains minimally responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in neurological status since admission.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Neurological deterioration: The patient has been off sedation for more than one week, and his CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's neurological status and provide appropriate care to prevent further deterioration.

2. Extubation: The plan is to extubate the patient today. Extubation can be a critical step in the patient's recovery process. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and readiness for extubation is essential to prevent respiratory failure.

3. Skin breakdown: The patient is developing mouth ulcers secondary to the endotracheal tube, and there is also a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. Frequent turning, appropriate low-pressure bed usage, and orabase solution application should be continued to prevent further skin breakdown.

4. Infection: Although the patient has completed a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia and all blood cultures have shown no growth, it is still important to remain vigilant for any signs of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is necessary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury. He is currently in the ICU, extubated and breathing on his own. The patient's neurological status has shown minor improvements but he remains unresponsive. He has been off sedation for over a week, and CT and EEG results indicate anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Other causes of encephalopathy have been ruled out.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological deterioration: The patient's severe neurologic injury and lack of meaningful improvement in neurological status suggest a high risk of further neurological deterioration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient previously had pneumonia, although it appears to be under control with the completion of a course of levofloxacin. However, there is still a risk of recurrent or new infections due to his compromised immune system.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias and continues to experience episodes of ectopy/NSVT. This indicates a risk of recurrent arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient is developing mouth ulcers and a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. Frequent turning and appropriate wound care should be implemented to prevent further skin breakdown.
5. Left to Right Shunt: The patient may have a left to right shunt secondary to anomalous"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury. He remains unresponsive and has shown only minor improvements in his neurological status since admission. The patient was extubated and is breathing independently, with no overnight events. His wife has been at the bedside, although she and their children are emotionally upset.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
- Heart rate: 101 bpm (normal range: 78-101 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 132/68 mmHg (normal range: 110-145/62-94 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute (normal range: 11-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on room air

The patient has a history of pneumonia, for which he completed a course of levofloxacin. He now has low-grade temperatures, which respond well to Tylenol. Sputum cultures showed oral flora, and all blood cultures were negative.

The patient also has a dilated heart with preserved ejection fraction, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral valve involvement. He experiences episodes of ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which have responded to increased metoprolol. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN, Consider changing to gtt
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluate again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.
   - No intervention at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury. The patient remains unresponsive and has not shown significant improvement in neurological status since admission. The patient is extubated and breathing independently.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Neurological status: The patient's severe neurologic injury and lack of meaningful improvement indicate a high risk for persistent neurological dysfunction or further deterioration.

2. Skin breakdown: The patient is developing mouth ulcers due to the endotracheal tube and has a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. This suggests a risk for skin breakdown and pressure ulcers, especially considering the patient's neurologic condition and inability to reposition themselves.

3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias and continues to have episodes of ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). There is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias or progression to more serious arrhythmias.

4. Infection: Although the patient has completed a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia and all blood cultures were negative, there is still a risk for developing infections due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.

5. Left to right shunt: The patient has a most likely"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest and suffered severe neurologic injury.
- The patient has shown minor improvements in neurological status since admission but remains unresponsive.
- The patient has been extubated and is breathing on his own.
- The patient's CT and EEG show signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift, ruling out other causes of encephalopathy.
- Comfort measures have been implemented, including stopping all medications except for comfort medications like morphine and scopolamine.
- The patient is still on telemetry due to the cardiac arrest.
- The patient completed a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia and is now responding well to tylenol.
- The patient has episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which respond well to increased metoprolol.
- The patient is developing mouth ulcers secondary to the endotracheal tube and has a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar.
- The patient has a left-to-right shunt, most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, but no longer requires intervention.
- The patient's lines, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis have been adjusted accordingly.
- The patient's disposition is CCU for now, with consideration for transfer to a palliative care unit.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient had a recent course of antibiotics for pneumonia, but since the sputum cultures showed oral flora, there may still be a risk of developing pneumonia again due to the compromised state of the patient's respiratory system.

2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient experienced ventricular arrhythmias leading to cardiac arrest. Although the patient is currently on telemetry and responding well to increased metoprolol, there is still a risk of recurrent arrhythmias.

3. Skin breakdown: The patient is developing mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer, indicating potential skin breakdown due to immobility and pressure.

4. Neurological deterioration: Despite minor improvements, the patient remains unresponsive and has severe neurological injury. There is a risk of further neurological deterioration.

5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the use of medical devices such as central lines, urinary catheters, and the endotracheal tube.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is no longer on heparin prophylaxis, there is still a risk of developing DVT due to immobility.

These potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed to ensure the best possible care for the patient."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN, Consider changing to gtt
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluated again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.
   - No intervention at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who experienced a cardiac arrest and suffered severe neurologic injury. The patient has shown minor improvements in neurological status since admission but remains unresponsive. He has been extubated and is breathing independently. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Neurological status: The patient's lack of meaningful responsiveness indicates severe neurologic injury. This may lead to further deterioration or the development of additional neurological complications.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia, which suggests a current or recent infection. Although the patient responded well to tylenol and sputum cultures showed oral flora, there is still a risk of recurrent or persistent pneumonia.

3. Rhythm disturbances: The patient continues to have episodes of ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which have responded well to increased metoprolol. However, the patient's dilated heart with preserved ejection fraction, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration puts him at risk for future cardiac arrhythmias.

4. Skin breakdown: The patient is developing mouth ulcers secondary to the endotracheal tube and has a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. This indicates the need for regular turning, use of orabase"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluate again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.
   - No intervention at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluate again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia, but
   continues to have fevers. Responds well to Tylenol. Sputum Cultures
   showed oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.
   - No intervention at this time.

   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluate again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.
   - No intervention at this time.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and bicuspid aortic valve.
- He suffered from a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias and has severe neurological injuries with no meaningful improvement since admission.
- The patient has minor improvements in neurological status but is still not meaningfully responsive.
- He has been extubated and breathing on his own.
- The CT and EEG show signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.
- Other causes of encephalopathy have been ruled out.
- The patient's comfort measures include stopping all medications except for comfort medications such as morphine prn and scopolamine.
- Palliative care has been consulted, and further evaluation will be done on Monday.
- Telemetry continues, and further lab draws/lasix are not indicated.
- The patient has completed a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia and responds well to tylenol.
- Sputum cultures showed oral flora, and all blood cultures are negative.
- The patient has episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased metoprolol.
- The patient is developing mouth ulcers secondary to the endotracheal tube and has a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar.
- The left-to-right shunt is most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, but an MRI is no longer indicated in this comfort measures"
