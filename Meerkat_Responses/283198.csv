   Assessment and Plan
   The patinet is a 58 year old male with a history of DM, HTN,
   dyslipdemia and CAD s/p IMI with NSTEMI in the setting of infection.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has a history of CAD, with prior IMI, now
   with mild elevation of cardiac enzymes and ischemic EKG changes in the
   setting of infection.  Patient transfered for cardiac catheterization,
   which is deffered due to ongoing infection.  Likely demand ischemia,
   and patient currently chest pain free without evidence of ongoing heart
   damage.
   - cont ASA, metoprolol, and high-dose statin
   - patient on plavix at home, although indication for cont plavix
   therapy.  Patient did not receive plavix load.  No need to plavix load
   as on previously.
   - SLNG for chest pain
   - likely cardiac catheterization once medically stabilized.
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE performed at [**Hospital1 2975**] with worsened global systolic
   function, with EF decreased from 35% from 60% with new posterior wall,
   anterior septum and apical akensis.  [**Month (only) 11**] be cardiac stunning in the
   setting of demand ischemia versus toxic-metabolic in the setting of
   infecition.  Currently with elevated JVP, worsened oxygen requirment
   and fluid overload on CXR.
   - CXR to evaluate lung fields
   - will check BNP
   - cont metoprolol
   - will hold home ACE in setting of ARF
   - will diurese with a goal of negative 500cc and continue to evaluate
   fluid status.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm without history of arrythmia.
   .
   # FEVER:  The patient intially felt to have viral gastroenteritis with
   N/V/Fever.  Chest XR with a quiestion of PNA, although may opacificion
   secondary to HF. Influenza negative and BCx from [**11-30**] NGTD.
   - CXR to evaluate for PNA
   - Check BCx and UCx
   - Tylenol PRN fever
   - Will start levofloxacin for PNA given tenuous respiratory status.
   .
   # HYPOXIA:  Again, likely secondary to heart failure in the setting of
   decreased systolic function and fevers with pulmonary edema on CXR.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have some contribution of potential PNA.
   - CXR
   - diuresis with IV lasix
   - ween O2 as tolerated
   - PRN nebulizer treatments, although not currently wheezing
   .
   #  DM:  Patient with marked hyperglycemia in the setting of infection.
   - will continue home insulin regmimen, but if continued hyperglycemia,
   may benefit from insuling gtt
   - will check lytes/urine for evidence of DKA
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal Failure:  Patient with baseline Cr of 1.6, up
   to 2.1 from 1.7 at OSH.  ? of hypovolumia in the setting of infection
   vs. poor forward flow in the setting of acute systolic heart failure.
   - will check UA and send urine lyets
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - will diureis as described and follow Cr closely.
   .
   #  Depression: continue home meds
   .
   FEN:  Low sodium, cardiac, DM diet.  NPO at MN for possible cath.
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with sc heparin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of infection. The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is currently receiving multiple treatments including insulin for hyperglycemia, heparin for NSTEMI, and antibiotics for infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 77 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 124/66 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's physical examination reveals no chest wall deformities or scoliosis, but there is evidence of tachypnea and faint crackles at the bases of the lungs. The patient's abdomen appears unremarkable with no tenderness or masses. The extremities are without edema or peripheral pulses abnormalities. The patient's skin is also unremarkable.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), glucose, troponin T, creatinine (Cr), and BUN, along with decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hb), potassium (K+"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patinet is a 58 year old male with a history of DM, HTN,
   dyslipdemia and CAD s/p IMI with NSTEMI in the setting of infection.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has a history of CAD, with prior IMI, now
   with mild elevation of cardiac enzymes and ischemic EKG changes in the
   setting of infection.  Likely demand ischemia, and patient currently
   chest pain free without evidence of ongoing heart damage.  No urgent
   need for cath today given possible infection.
   - cont ASA, metoprolol, and high-dose statin, Plavix, heparin and
   integrilin
   - SLNG for chest pain
   - cardiac catheterization once medically stabilized
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE performed at [**Hospital1 2975**] with worsened global systolic
   function, with EF decreased from 35% from 60% with new posterior wall,
   anterior septum and apical kinesis.  [**Month (only) 11**] be cardiac stunning in the
   setting of demand ischemia versus toxic-metabolic in the setting of
   infection.  Currently with elevated JVP, worsened oxygen requirement
   and fluid overload on CXR.
   - continue to diuresis with Lasix today with goal of -1L
   - continue ACE and b-blocker
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm without history of arrhythmia.
   .
   # FEVER:  CXR consistent with LLL PNA.  Pt being treated with
   Levofloxin 750 IV q48H. Influenza negative and BCx from [**11-30**] NGTD. Pt
   currently afebrile.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Tylenol PRN fever
   - Levoquin for 5 days (today is day #2)
   .
   # HYPOXIA:  Again, likely secondary to heart failure in the setting of
   decreased systolic function and fevers with pulmonary edema on CXR.
   Also PNA contributing.
   - diuresis with IV lasix
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - PRN nebulizer treatments, although not currently wheezing
   .
   #  DM:  Patient with marked hyperglycemia in the setting of infection.
   - continue insulin gtt and electrolyte monitoring for assessment of
   ketoacidosis.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal Failure:  Patient with baseline Cr of 1.6, up
   to 2.1 from 1.7 at OSH.  ? of hypovolumia in the setting of infection
   vs. poor forward flow in the setting of acute systolic heart failure.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - will diureis as described and follow Cr closely.

   58 year old male with a history of DM, HTN, dyslipidemia and CAD s/p
   IMI with NSTEMI in the setting of infection.
   # CORONARIES: The patient has a history of CAD, with prior inferior MI,
   now with mild elevation of cardiac enzymes.  This was unlikely a true
   NSTEMI, but rather a troponin leak from demand ischemia in the setting
   of infection and acute renal failure.  The patient is currently chest
   pain free without evidence of ongoing heart damage.
   - Continue ASA, high-dose statin, and Plavix; increase his metoprolol
   to 37.5 mg tid for better HR control.
   - SLNG for chest pain
   - No current need for cardiac catheterization at this time.
   # Acute systolic heart failure:  TTE performed at [**Hospital1 2975**] with

   with new posterior wall, anterior septum and apical kinesis.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   cardiac stunning in the setting of demand ischemia versus
   toxic-metabolic in the setting of infection.  His CXR shows improvement
   in his volume overload and his JVP is down from yesterday.
   - Continue to diuresis with lasix, now switching to lasix 60 mg po bid.
   - Will increase his metoprolol as above; holding acei given ARF.
   # HYPERTENSION: The patient SBP
s have been up into the 140
s.  Given
   his acute systolic heart failure, would want to increase his afterload
   reduction.
   - Will start amlodipine 5 mg daily.
   - Increase metoprolol as above and continue lasix treatment now with po
   lasix 60 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - Restart acei once his ARF resolves.
   # RHYTHM: Currently in sinus rhythm without history of arrhythmia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of an infection. The patient's current condition is improving, with no chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/72 to 93/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute systolic heart failure: The patient's echocardiogram shows decreased global systolic function with an ejection fraction decreased from 35% to 60%. This indicates worsening heart function.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings have been elevated, ranging from 146/72 to 93/55 mmHg.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.6, which increased to 2.1 and now remains stable at 1.9.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient continues to have elevated blood glucose levels in the range of 200-300 mg/dL despite being off the insulin gtt.
