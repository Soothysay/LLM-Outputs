","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder and asthma/COPD. He presented with altered mental status and had a fall. The patient's current condition includes left pleural effusion, rapid atrial flutter, CNS lesion, and seizure disorder. He was unable to tolerate a contrast MRI, and his heart rate increased. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. An MRI with contrast or a CT scan with contrast may be necessary. The patient may need to be premedicated with haloperidol (Haldol) and possibly intubated for the procedure.

2. Fall: The fall could be due to a variety of reasons such as arrhythmia, seizure, or hypotension. To investigate further, an EEG to assess for seizure activity, a neurology consult, telemetry monitoring, and follow-up head imaging may be required.

3. Left Pleural Effusion and Post-obstructive Pneumonia with Left Hilar Mass: The patient has a left pleural effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia with a left hilar mass. Diagnostic tapping/bronchoscopies will be needed when the patient is able to provide consent. A primary bronchogenic malignancy is suspected based on the CT appearance, and the patient's history of smoking"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, asthma/COPD who presented with altered mental status and a fall. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, left effusion, post-obstructive pneumonia, and atrial flutter. He is critically ill and receiving various treatments in the ICU, including medication infusions, respiratory support, and prophylactic measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to several factors, including a possible brain mass, seizure, or arrhythmia. Further evaluation with an EEG and neuro consult is planned to determine the underlying cause.

2. Fall: The fall could be attributed to a variety of causes such as arrhythmia, seizure, or heatstroke. An EEG and telemetry are ongoing to monitor the patient's brain activity and heart rhythm. Follow-up head imaging may also be necessary.

3. Left effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient has a left effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia, which requires ongoing antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin and metronidazole. A diagnostic tap may be performed to further assess the situation.

4. Atrial flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, for which he is receiving diltiazem and IV propranolol. Cardioversion was attempted but was complicated by a possible brain mass. The patient will be in touch with cardiology for further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, who presented to the hospital after a fall. He was found to have atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response and a possible intracranial lesion. The patient underwent elective intubation for an MRI but experienced hypotension following the procedure. He required low-dose pressor support, which has since been weaned off. The patient's heart rate remains in the low 100s since starting metoprolol. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been planned for the morning, and discussion of cardioversion with cardiology is ongoing. The patient's mitral valve shows a small to medium-sized mobile mass, which could be a thrombus, myxoma, vegetation, or papillary fibroelastoma. An MRI of the left parietal cortex revealed a 1.3 cm lesion. The patient's mental status is unchanged from admission, and he has a history of schizoaffective disorder. He is on various psychotropic medications, and a psych consult has been requested. The patient's sister has given consent for the current work-up plan. Potential medical complications that can arise include malignant effusion, mass biopsy, and thoracentesis for the hilar mass."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU after a fall. He has been diagnosed with atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response and possible intracranial lesion. A mobile mass was seen on the echocardiogram in the body of the left atrium, which appears to be attached to the base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet. The differential diagnosis for this mass includes thrombus, myxoma, vegetation, and papillary fibroelastoma. The patient underwent an MRI of the brain, which showed a 1.3 cm lesion in the left parietal cortex. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned for further evaluation of the mitral valve mass. The patient's sister has provided consent for ongoing treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage or lesion: The patient's fall and the presence of a possible intracranial lesion on the MRI indicate a potential risk for bleeding or further damage to the brain.
2. Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response: The patient's irregular heart rhythm can lead to decreased cardiac output and potential complications such as hypotension or arrhythmias.
3. Mitral valve mass: The presence of a mass on the mitral valve can cause obstruction of blood flow from the left atrium"

   no PE. large mass centered in the left hilus again identified. It
   narrows the left mainstem bronchus as well as left upper lobe bronchus,
   with complete obstruction of the lower and lingular bronchi. It appears
   to directly invade the pericardium and myocardium, extending
   exophytically in the left atrium via the posterior wall. the left
   inferior pulm vein is not opacified, c/w occlusion and possible
   invasion of this structure as well. unchanged prominent mediastinal
   lymph nodes. bilateral lung nodules as described on prior non-contrast
   study. Left effusion and post-obstructive collapse/pneumonities,
   increased from prior study. sclerotic lesion in the lateal right 4th
   rib concerning for additional metastatic disease.
   [**2172-3-4**] TEE:
   A mass is seen in the poterior wall of the left atrium near the site of
   the left upper pulmonary vein (not seen). The left atrial mass has a
   broad base measuring 2.5 x 0.8 cm with a miobile, stalk-like aspect
   measuring 3 x 0.7 cm- ? Thrombus versus extension of mass. The left
   atiral appendage is seen and is free of mass or thrombus. No mass or
   thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
   seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
   is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Heterogenous mass with broad base (2.5 x 1.8 cm) and mobile
   stalk (3 x 0.7 cm) seen in the left posterior atrial wall adjacent to
   entrance of the left lower pulmonary vein and possibly occluding the
   entrance of the left upper pulmonary vein (not seen). The mass may be
   entering the left atrium via the left upper pulmonary vein. No valvular
   vegetations seen. Mild mitral regurgitation. Normal biventricular
   systolic function. Small pericardial effusion seen. Bilateral pelural
   effusions seen.
   [**2172-3-3**] MRI brain:
   Focal enhancement and edema centered around the left postcentral
   gyrus is concerning for a mestastasis given the location and large
   pulmonary
   mass on the chest CT. Additional differential considerations would
   include
   infection or a primary brain tumor. The appearance would be unusual for
   a
   vascular malformation, despite the prominent superficial vessel, and
   also
   unusual for an evolving infarct. A repeat study with the leads removed
   and
   addition of perfusion sequences would be useful in further evaluation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is an altered mental status. The 24-hour events include transesophageal echo, bronchoscopy, and thoracentesis. The patient had a left atrial mass confirmed by both transesophageal echo and CT angiography, which also showed a large mass centered in the left hilus narrowing the left mainstem bronchus as well as the left upper lobe bronchus. There was complete obstruction of the lower and lingular bronchi, with extension exophytically in the left atrium via the posterior wall. The left inferior pulmonary vein was not opacified, suggesting occlusion and possible invasion. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes were also seen, along with bilateral lung nodules, left effusion, and post-obstructive collapse/pneumonitis. Additionally, there was a sclerotic lesion in the lateral right 4th rib, which is concerning for additional metastatic disease.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), a heart rate of 120 bpm with atrial flutter, blood pressure ranging from 83/58 mmHg to 117/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is 77.2 kg. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is 79%. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,301 mL and a total output of 1,000 mL, resulting in a balance of 3,301 mL. The patient required pressors during the day to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 65 but was able to wean off at night. A PICC line was placed.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was administered on [**2172-3-4**]. Propofol infusion was given at a rate of 30 mcg/kg/min, and fentanyl was administered at [**2172-3-4**] 01:19 PM. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The flow sheet data shows various vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 99. Plateau pressure is 18 cmH2O, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 24 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are unavailable.

Physical examination findings include a large mass centered in the left hilus, narrowing the left mainstem bronchus as well as the left upper lobe bronchus, complete obstruction of the lower and lingular"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder presenting after a fall with atrial flutter and possible intracranial lesion. The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, hypomagnesemia, pleural effusion, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient underwent several procedures, including transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), bronchoscopy, and thoracentesis. The TEE revealed a left atrial mass that could not be distinguished between thrombus and tumor. The CTA chest showed a left hilar mass extending into the myocardium and left atrium, with invasion of the pericardium, myocardium, and left upper pulmonary vein. There were also prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, bilateral lung nodules, left effusion, and post-obstructive collapse/pneumonitis.

Laboratory results indicated elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, platelets, and magnesium levels. The patient's blood glucose level was low, while the calcium and phosphorus levels were within normal range. The assessment and plan included hypotension, hypomagnesemia, pleural effusion, altered mental status, atrial flutter, and a left atrial mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Malignant effusion: Given the presence of a left pleural effusion and hilar mass, there is a concern for malignant effusion.
2. Intrabronch"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder. He presents with syncope and is found to have a mass in the hilar region of the left lung, invading the pericardium, and a brain lesion suggestive of metastasis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 124 bpm, hypertension with a blood pressure of 143/127 mmHg, and an irregular heart rhythm of atrial flutter. His respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 99%. The patient is receiving propofol infusion, fentanyl, simvastatin, flagyl, levaquin, divalproate, celexa, and atrovent.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 113 K/uL, and thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 137 K/uL. Renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are also within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal a mass invading the heart, and a preliminary chest CT shows a hilar mass. The assessment and plan include the following:

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder who is critically ill in the ICU. He presents with atrial flutter and a mass in the hilar/atrial region, confirmed by imaging. The mass is suspected to be malignant. The patient also has respiratory failure, possibly due to mental status changes and potential further procedures. There is no evidence of active infection, so antibiotics will be discontinued. The patient's mental status may be related to a L parietal lesion with suspected metastases. He is currently sedated, but once sedation is discontinued, he will restart prolixin. The patient is NPO for extubation, but if not extubated today, he will start tube feeds. Decision-making is pending guardianship decisions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to mental status changes and further procedures.
2. Infection, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility in the ICU.
4. Stress ulcers due to critical illness and sedation.
5. Poor glycemic control due to stress and nutrition in the ICU.
6. Potential cardiac complications from the atrial mass and agitation.
7. Neurological complications from the L parietal lesion with suspected metastases.
8. Possible bleeding complications from the friable mass within the L mainstem bronchus."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, presenting after a fall with atrial flutter, intracranial lesion, and lung mass.
- The patient underwent a bronchoscopy which revealed a necrotic mass in the left mainstem bronchus with friable tissue.
- The patient is currently intubated and has a left pleural effusion/hilar mass, likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia.
- The patient's respiratory status is stable with the assistance of mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response, and metoprolol has been initiated to control the heart rate.
- The patient's neurological status is concerning for metastasis, as an MRI revealed a parietal lesion consistent with likely metastasis.
- The patient has oliguria/anuria and is being closely monitored.
- The patient's oncology and radiation oncology consultations have been placed.
- The patient's schizoaffective disorder management will continue with the current medication regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant Neoplasm: The presence of a lung mass and intracranial lesion suggests the possibility of metastatic cancer. Further evaluation and treatment by oncology services will be necessary.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's heart rhythm is currently in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to maintain"

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of malignancy who presented to the ICU with hypotension and oliguria/anuria. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and stent placement, as well as a transbronchial biopsy. Oncology, radiation oncology, and palliative care consultations were obtained. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 67/58 mmHg to 133/87 mmHg. Heart rate has been elevated, ranging from 85-141 bpm. Respiratory support is being provided through an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation remains stable at 99%. Fluid balance shows a total input of 5,708 mL and output of 1,063 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,645 mL. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.7 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 168 K/uL, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium levels. Imaging studies are pending. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of oliguria/anuria. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [date] and had a stent placed, as well as a transbronchial biopsy. Oncology, radiation oncology, and palliative care were consulted. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 86/62 mmHg to 133/87 mmHg. Heart rate has been consistently high, between 131 and 141 beats per minute. Respiratory rate has been within normal limits, ranging from 12 to 31 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation has remained stable at 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated, responding only to voice. Physical examination reveals CTAB anteriorly, soft abdomen without masses or organomegaly, and warm extremities without crepitation or edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Other lab values are within normal limits or not significantly abnormal. The patient has been receiving various medications including propofol, metoprolol, and others. The patient's disposition is currently listed as undetermined.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of smoking and schizoaffective disorder. He is currently admitted to the ICU for syncope and is critically ill. The patient has respiratory failure, a left lung mass, pleural effusion, and brain metastasis. He underwent a bronchoscopy with stent placement and biopsy of the right middle lobe. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia and hypotension. He is on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and supplemental oxygen. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies are pending to confirm the diagnosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and altered mental status increase the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Barotrauma: The patient's lung collapse and bronchospasm may increase the risk of barotrauma from positive-pressure ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and hypotension suggest a possible infection and sepsis.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's right lower extremity edema raises concerns for deep vein thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, presenting after a fall. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response, an intracranial lesion, and a lung mass. There is a strong suspicion for advanced primary lung cancer. The patient underwent left bronchial stenting and is currently intubated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a major barrier to extubation. It is important to reassess mental status (MS) as sedation is shut off.
2. Atrial Flutter: Rate control in atrial flutter needs to be maintained with verapamil 40 mg TID.
3. Mental Status Change: The patient's MS change is likely related to mass effect, and neurologic evaluation is required.
4. Schizoaffective Disorder: The patient's schizoaffective disorder medications should be continued, including depakote, celexa, prolixin, and seroquel, due to sedation concerns.
5. Nutrition: The patient has started on tube feeding (TF).
6. Guardianship: Legal guardianship paperwork was filed on 03/06/2172.
7. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output needs to be monitored closely.
8. Pleural Effusion, Acute: Further evaluation and management are needed for the acute"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, presenting with atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and lung mass after falling. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with oliguria/anuria and cancer (malignant neoplasm), and there is a strong suspicion for advanced primary lung cancer. The patient has been started on verapamil for atrial flutter, and the dose has been reduced due to hypotension. The patient's mental status is altered but not delirium, and the patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV). The plan includes turning off propofol, performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and checking arterial blood gas (ABG) to assess readiness for extubation. The patient's guardian has been appointed, and the legal paperwork has been completed. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient has pleural effusion and an acute pulmonary mass. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, cancer, atrial flutter, hypotension, and pleural effusion."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar, and a smoker. He presented with a fall and was found to have a mediastinal mass with metastasis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, intubated to facilitate an MRI, and difficult to extubate. He has a hilar mass with likely metastasis, post-obstructive pneumonia, atrial flutter (now sinus), mental status changes, and is dependent on tube feeds for nutrition. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. Weaning off sedation and performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be challenging due to difficult extubation and post-obstructive pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure or complications related to ventilation.
2. Hilar Mass with Likely Metastasis: The presence of a hilar mass with likely metastasis indicates an underlying malignancy. Further diagnostic evaluations, such as cytology and pathology, are pending. Potential complications may include disease progression, spread to other organs, or complications from treatment interventions.
3. Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia, likely secondary to the mediastinal mass causing airway obstruction. Continuing antibiotics (Levofloxacin and Metronidazole) is appropriate. There is a risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar, who presented with a fall and was found to have a mediastinal mass with metastasis. He is currently in respiratory failure and has been intubated to facilitate an MRI. The patient is difficult to extubate and has post-obstructive pneumonia and mental status changes. He is also experiencing atrial flutter, which has now converted to sinus rhythm. The patient is on verapamil and levo. He is being treated with seroquel for agitation. Cytology and pathology results for the hilar mass with likely metastasis are pending. The patient's mental status changes will be reassessed off propofol. The patient's nutrition is being advanced through tube feeds. Daily updates are being provided to the patient's sister, and a court-appointed guardian is awaiting to assist with goals of care decision-making.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently in respiratory failure and has been intubated. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Difficult to extubate: The patient's difficulty in being extubated increases the risk of post-extubation complications such as stridor, airway obstruction, or need for re-intubation.
3. Hilar mass with likely metastasis: Further evaluation is needed to determine the nature"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the hospital with altered mental status, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and lung mass. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and pleural effusion. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This should be monitored closely, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated if necessary.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and early mobilization should be implemented.

3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments and repositioning are necessary to prevent this.

4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the invasive lines and devices. Cultures should be obtained before initiating antibiotics, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be administered if an infection occurs.

5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response increases the risk of further cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, heavy smoking, and alcoholism. He presented to the hospital after a fall and was found to have a mediastinal mass compressing the pulmonary vein, left lower lobe atelectasis, and encasing the left mainstem bronchus. There is also a concern for metastases to the brain based on CT imaging, and an echogenic mass in the right atrium observed on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

24-hour events:
The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with symptoms of tachycardia, hypertension, and decreased oxygen saturation. An MRI of the brain is pending.

Medical and family history:
The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the mentioned above.

Physical examination:
The patient is intubated and sedated, but follows commands. His heart sounds are regular, and he has rhonchorous breath sounds on the left side with expiratory wheeze on the right. His abdomen is soft, and he has no peripheral edema. Neurological examination reveals movement of the left arm spontaneously and to commands with 2+ strength, while the right arm has no strength and cannot lift off the bed.

Laboratory findings:
The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.7 thousand/mm"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar, smoker, who was found to have a mediastinal mass with metastases. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 66 bpm, blood pressure 94/56 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. 

His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure, where there has been an improvement in aeration on chest X-ray this morning and he tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). 

The patient has a history of leukocytosis, malignancy (with a scrotal mass noted overnight), atrial fibrillation (which has spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm), new right-sided weakness, and feeding tube placement. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, has a PICC line and arterial line in place, and is being given prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to extubation failure or worsening of underlying lung condition, infection due to leukocytosis and immunocompromised state, worsening of malignancy, cardiovascular complications due to atrial fibrillation and potential arrhythm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU after a fall. The patient has several ongoing medical issues including atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, an intracranial lesion, and a lung mass. The patient's condition is being closely monitored and managed by a multidisciplinary team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right-sided weakness: The patient's right-sided weakness is suspected to be caused by a left parietal lesion. The plan is to continue steroids and consider changing to dexamethasone, follow up with a final read MRI, and consult neurology again.

2. Left hilar mass/Brain mass: There is a strong suspicion for advanced primary lung cancer. The patient has undergone a left bronchial stent procedure, and pathology results are pending. Oncology, radiation oncology, and palliative care have been consulted.

3. MS change: The patient's mental status change is likely related to mass effect. Neurology is waiting to reassess the patient's mental status, and an EEG with slowing has been performed.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well. Propofol is being turned off, and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted today with ABG checks. Possible extubation is being considered.

5. Pneumonia (PNA) and leukocytosis:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU after a fall. He has a suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), right-sided weakness, and a lung mass. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and lung mass. His condition is concerning for possible brain metastases, emboli from cardiac mass/thrombosis, advanced primary lung cancer, mass effect, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) but may need further evaluation and possible extubation.
2. Right-sided weakness: The patient's weakness could be due to a bleed at the site of suspected brain metastases or possible mass effect. Further assessment and management are required.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's heart rhythm is improved with rate control since starting verapamil, but ongoing monitoring and management are necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, possibly related to infection or high-dose steroid use. Further investigation and management are needed.
5. Schizoaffective disorder: The patient's psychiatric condition requires ongoing management with current medications.
6. Potential sources of infection: The patient has several possible sources of infection, including aspiration, post-obstructive pneumonia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yoM w/ a h/o schizoaffective disorder presents s/p fall with atrial
   flutter with a rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and
   lung mass.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation for 5 days. [**Month/Year (2) **]
   successfully today
   - continue abx for possible PNA (levo/flagyl)
   - NC O2 to keep O2 sats >88%
   - IV diuresis with goal 500ml out
   # R sided weakness:
   Suspect this is due to L parietal lesion
   -- serial neuro recs
   -- continue prednisone, consider changing to dex
   -- follow up final read MRI
   -- follow up neuro recs.

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU after a fall. He has been intubated for five days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has several medical conditions including atrial flutter, a left parietal brain lesion, lung mass, testicular mass, and thrombocytopenia. He also has a history of primary lung cancer and is currently awaiting pathology results from a left bronchial stent procedure. The patient's mental status is described as sleepy but arousable, and he is able to follow simple commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for five days and requires ongoing respiratory support. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if oxygenation or ventilation parameters are not optimized.
2. Right-sided weakness: The patient has R arm weakness, which is suspected to be caused by the left parietal brain lesion. Continued monitoring and evaluation of neurologic function are necessary.
3. Lung mass/brain mass: The patient has a strong suspicion for advanced primary lung cancer with metastasis to the brain. Further diagnostic workup, including pathology results from the left bronchial stent procedure and cytology results, is needed. Management will involve oncology and radiation oncology consultation.
4. Testicular mass: Given the known lung cancer, there is concern for metastasis to the testicles. A testicular ultrasound"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a chief complaint of a fall and questioned SAH (subarachnoid hemorrhage). The patient experienced right arm weakness, prompting CT and MRI scans of the head. Preliminary readings showed no significant changes. Neurology re-consulted, suggesting the possibility of a mass causing the weakness, although the weakness is a new development. Extubation was deferred until early morning due to a late MRI.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They received Levofloxacin and Metronidazole on 03/08/2172 at 08:00 AM and 01:30 PM, respectively. Propofol infusion was given at a rate of 15 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include Propofol administered on 03/09/2172 at 05:30 AM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: maximum temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), current temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 76 bpm with a range of 60-94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/51 mmHg to 167/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute with inspiration, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 80.7 kg, with a height of 72 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1168 mL"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, who presented to the ICU after a fall. He was initially intubated due to atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. Subsequent investigations revealed intracranial and lung masses, strongly suggesting advanced primary lung cancer. The patient underwent bronchial stenting and is awaiting pathology results. He also has right-sided weakness, which is suspected to be caused by a left parietal lesion. Neurological recommendations have been made, including continuing steroids and following up with a final read MRI. The patient's testicular mass is also of concern for possible metastasis, and a testicular ultrasound has been ordered for further characterization.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter has shown improvement in rate control since starting verapamil. However, close monitoring and adjustment of medication dosages may be necessary to maintain stable heart rhythms.

2. Right-Sided Weakness: The patient's right-sided weakness is likely due to a left parietal lesion. It is important to continue steroids as recommended by neurology and follow up with a final read MRI to assess the progression of the lesion and any potential impact on neurological function.

3. Lung Mass/Brain Mass: The presence of lung and brain masses strongly suggests advanced primary lung cancer. Oncology, radiation oncology, and palliative care consultations have been made, and the patient is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and recent findings of mediastinal mass and post-obstructive pneumonia. He presented to the ICU after experiencing syncope and a fall. The patient has multiple medical conditions including lung cancer, brain metastasis, left atrial mass, and pleural effusion. He was intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by COPD, post-obstructive pneumonia, volume overload, and left lower lobe collapse. He has shown improvement with chest physiotherapy and gentle suction as needed.

The patient also has right upper extremity weakness, which has somewhat improved today, and an upcoming MRI will be compared with previous findings. The mediastinal mass will be further evaluated with cytology and pathology results pending. There is a plan to consult with radiation oncology regarding the mass.

The patient is currently experiencing atrial flutter and will continue on verapamil. His schizoaffective disorder medications need to be adjusted, and a psychiatry consultation has been requested to optimize the medication regimen and assess competency for medical decision-making.

Other assessments include the need for further evaluation of the testicular ultrasound and reassessment of feeding tube placement now that the patient is extubated. The patient's PICC line and arterial line will be addressed accordingly.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar, who is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. He has several medical conditions, including COPD, post-obstructive pneumonia, volume overload, and mediastinal mass. The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and right upper extremity weakness. He is also in atrial flutter and has a history of schizoaffective disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's COPD, post-obstructive pneumonia, volume overload, and LLL collapse put him at risk for worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.

2. Right upper extremity weakness: The patient's weakness in the right upper extremity may be due to the lesion in his brain. Further evaluation with an MRI is needed to determine the cause and extent of the weakness. Physical therapy and neurologic consultation will help guide the management.

3. Mediastinal mass: The presence of a mediastinal mass requires further investigation to determine its nature. Cytology and pathology results are pending, and consultation with hematology/oncology and radiation oncology is recommended. If the mass is malignant, the patient may require further treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

4. Atrial flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, which should be managed with continued use of verapamil to control the heart rate. Monitoring of the"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yoM w/ a h/o schizoaffective disorder presents s/p fall with atrial
   flutter with a rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and
   lung mass.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation for 5 days. [**Month/Year (2) **]
   successfully today
   - continue abx for possible PNA (levo/flagyl day 1=[**3-5**], today day 6)
   - NC O2 to keep O2 sats >88%
   - IV diuresis with goal 500ml out
   # R sided weakness:
   Suspect this is due to L parietal lesion
   -- serial neuro recs
   -- continue prednisone, consider changing to dex
   -- follow up final read MRI
   -- follow up neuro recs.
   .
   # L hilar mass/Brain Mass- Strong suspicion for advanced primary lung
   ca. Now s/p L bronchial stent.
   --Awaiting pathology results
   --f/u cytology results
   --onc, rad onc, and palliative care have been consulted
   .
   # MS Change: Likely related to mass effect
   -- neuro waiting to reassess MS [**First Name (Titles) 3385**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
   -- EEG w/ slowing
   .
   # ?Pna and leukocytosis
   WBC trended down,  no significant fevers. Suspect aspiration pna vs
   post-obstructive pna.
   - continue levo/flagyl x8d course
   - follow up culture data
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Testicular mass
   Concern for mets given known lung CA
   - Testicular u/s for further characterization
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Improved rate control since starting Verapamil though
   80 TID dosing dropping pressures.
   --Cont with Verapamil 40mg TID
   --discontinue metoprolol
   .
   # Schizoaffective disorder:
   -- get psychiatry input on management and also to assesscompetency for
   guardianship issues
   -- continue home depakote, celexa
   -- holding prolixin, seroquel for now
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Slightly decreased today. DDX includes med effect, malignancy,
   infection. Not on any heparin
   - continue to trend CBC daily

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the hospital after being found down. He has been in the ICU for several days, and his condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for 5 days and successfully extubated today. Antibiotics will be continued for possible pneumonia, and oxygen therapy will be maintained to keep oxygen saturation levels above 88%.
2. Right-sided weakness: The patient is suspected to have left parietal lesion, which may be causing the weakness. Serial neurological assessments will be conducted, and prednisone treatment may be adjusted.
3. Left hilar mass/Brain mass: There is a strong suspicion of advanced primary lung cancer. A left bronchial stent has been placed, and pathology results are awaited. Oncology, radiation oncology, and palliative care consultations have been made.
4. MS change: The patient's myasthenia syndrome (MS) changes are likely related to mass effect. Neurological reassessment and EEG with slowing will be conducted.
5. Possible pneumonia (PNA) and leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count trended down, and there are no significant fevers. Aspiration PNA or post-obstructive PNA are suspected. Antibiotics will be continued for 8 days, and culture data will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, who presented to the ICU after falling and experiencing atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. He also had an intracranial lesion and lung mass. The patient was intubated for five days and successfully extubated on [3-9]. He is currently on 4L NC oxygen and showing signs of autodiuresis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal neurologic examination except for right-sided weakness. He has decreased breath sounds bilaterally, worse on the left, and a large effusion in the left lung. Imaging shows continued left lower lobe collapse and large effusion. The patient's laboratory results are mostly within normal limits, except for elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin-T. The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and a testicular mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's previous intubation for five days and current use of 4L NC oxygen indicate ongoing respiratory support needs. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation is necessary to prevent hypox"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, presented to the ICU after falling and experiencing atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. The patient has intracranial and lung masses, leading to a suspected diagnosis of advanced primary lung cancer. The patient underwent intubation for five days due to hypoxic respiratory failure and was successfully extubated today. 

The patient's current conditions include right-sided weakness, likely due to a left parietal lesion. Serial neurorecs are planned, along with follow-up final read MRI and neurorecs. The patient also has a left hilar mass/brain mass, with strong suspicion for advanced primary lung cancer. A bronchial stent has been placed, and pathology results are awaited. 

Additionally, the patient has multiple sclerosis (MS) changes, which are likely related to mass effect. An EEG showed slowing, and neuro waiting to reassess MS. The patient may have pneumonia (PNA) and leukocytosis, with a WBC trend down. Cultures and further follow-up are planned. 

There is a concern for testicular metastasis given the known lung cancer. A testicular ultrasound is recommended for further characterization. The patient's atrial flutter has improved rate control since starting verapamil, and metoprolol will be discontinued. 

The patient also has a history of schizoaffective disorder, and psychiatry input is needed for"

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation for 5 days. [**Month/Year (2) **]
   successfully today
   - continue abx for possible PNA (levo/flagyl)
   - NC O2 to keep O2 sats >88%
   - IV diuresis with goal 500ml out
   # R sided weakness:
   Suspect this is due to L parietal lesion
   -- serial neuro recs
   -- continue prednisone, consider changing to dex
   -- follow up final read MRI
   -- follow up neuro recs.
   .
   # L hilar mass/Brain Mass- Strong suspicion for advanced primary lung
   ca. Now s/p L bronchial stent.
   --Awaiting pathology results
   --f/u cytology results
   --onc, rad onc, and palliative care have been consulted

   - continue levo/flagyl x8d course
   - follow up culture data
   - continue to trend

   # Testicular mass
   Concern for mets given known lung CA
   - Testicular u/s for further characterization

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the hospital after falling. He was found down and intubated for five days due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical issues including atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, an intracranial lesion, lung mass, right-sided weakness, leukocytosis, and a testicular mass.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/81 mmHg to 129/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 76 kg at admission to 80.7 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 165 mL and total output of 3,570 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -3,405 mL. The patient's daily weights and intake/output records are available.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 12.8 g/dL, platelet count of 160 K/uL, blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL, serum creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and sodium level of 140 mEq/L.

He presented with syncope and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to obstruction and post-obstructive pneumonia, as well as volume overload and reactive airways disease. The patient is currently extubated and interactive, has identified a person to make medical decisions for him, and is tolerating oral medications. He has a history of COPD, bipolar disorder, and is currently receiving treatment for metastatic cancer. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is being closely monitored for any changes. Potential medical complications include respiratory failure, metastatic cancer progression, bipolar disorder exacerbation, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing antibiotics, chest physical therapy, steroids for COPD flare, and advancing diet as tolerated."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, presenting after a fall and diagnosed with atrial flutter, intracranial lesion, and lung mass. The patient had hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated for five days before successful extubation on [**3-9**]. Autodiuresis has occurred, and antibiotics are being continued for possible pneumonia. Oxygen therapy is ongoing to maintain O2 saturation above 88%. The patient also has right-sided weakness, suspected to be caused by a left parietal lesion. Serial neurologic examinations are planned, along with continuation of prednisone, follow-up final read MRI, and further neurologic consultations. A left hilar mass/brain mass is present, with a strong suspicion for advanced primary lung cancer, and a bronchial stent has been placed. Radiation oncology is involved, and plans for initiation of XRT are pending decision-making. Cytology results will be followed up, and oncology and palliative care are aware. Chemotherapy prior to radiation is not needed according to oncology. There is also a change in mental status, unclear baseline, with neurologic involvement and EEG showing slowing. A testicular mass with nodularity in the right scrotum is concerning for metastasis given the known lung cancer. A testicular ultrasound is ordered for further characterization. Atrial flutter has improved with rate control using verapamil. The patient's schiz"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU after a fall. The patient was intubated for five days and successfully extubated on [3-9]. He is currently on 4L NC oxygen and has experienced autodiuresis. The patient has a history of oliguria/anuria, cancer (malignant neoplasm), atrial flutter, hypotension, pleural effusion, right-sided weakness, left hilar mass/brain mass suspected to be advanced primary lung cancer, MS change, testicular mass, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure and ongoing hypoxic respiratory failure despite being on 4L NC oxygen. There is a concern for possible pneumonia (PNA) given the prolonged intubation period.
2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has a history of oliguria/anuria, which could indicate acute kidney injury or urinary tract obstruction.
3. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm): The patient has a known history of lung cancer with a suspected squamous cell carcinoma. There is a concern for metastasis given the presence of a testicular mass.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. Rate control measures are in place, but ongoing monitoring is required.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's arterial line stopped at 07:00 PM, and there were plans to transfer him to Hospital Ward for radiation treatments. No prednisone is required from a neurological standpoint, as this will be the last day for the course of COPD treatment. Doctor Last Name agreed with the plan and will serve as the patient's healthcare provider but needs to complete paperwork. An order for a testicular ultrasound was placed, and the patient was placed on a soft dysphagia diet after a speech/swallow evaluation.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Levofloxacin on 03/10/2172 at 10:02 AM and Metronidazole on 03/11/2172 at 12:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), current temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 78 bpm with a range of 76-99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/69 mmHg to 132/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute with a range of 14-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, presenting with altered mental status, respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, cancer (malignant neoplasm), atrial flutter, hypotension, pleural effusion, right-sided weakness, left hilar mass/brain mass, and testicular mass.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may be due to hypoxia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and continued use of non-invasive ventilation support are necessary.

2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output is decreased or absent. This can indicate kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury. Fluid management and monitoring of renal function are crucial.

3. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm): The patient has a history of lung cancer with a suspected primary lung squamous cell carcinoma. Further evaluation and treatment planning with radiation oncology should be considered.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. Rate control measures, such as verapamil, should be continued. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and hemodynamic status is essential.

5. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension. Hemodynamic monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation should be provided.

6. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an acute pleural effusion. Further evaluation through thoracentesis or imaging may be"

s note
   above. He is more lucid and conveys appropriate apprehension about his
   diagnosis and prognosis. He would like heroic support in the event of
   cardio-respiratory decline and we will address this with his HCP too.
   We will avoid beta 2 agonists ( atrovent preferably) and increase
   verapamil to help with tachycardia. Auto-diuresis likely predisposing
   him to rapid HR too. He will receive XRT to chest when he is stable
   from a BP/HR standpoint. He is ready to leave the ICU today.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yoM w/ a h/o schizoaffective disorder presents s/p fall with atrial
   flutter with a rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and
   lung mass who  has new dx of squamous cell lung cancer with extension
   into left atrium, and was started on IV amio load overnight.
   .
   # Atrial & Ventricular Ectopy :  recent atrial flutter had been
   improving until last night when he had some worse breakthrough runs of
   aflutter so his Verapamil was uptitrated to 120mg TID with IV boluses
   --continue close BP monitoring  on higher  verapamil dose
   -- amiodarone loaded overnight, switch to maintenance dosing (still on
   IV load)
   # L hilar mass/Brain Mass:  Given recent imaging and lung sample biopsy
   this is likely an advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer. He is now
   recovering well after recent left bronchial stent.  Also has left
   atrial mass which is a probable extension of his underlying lung
   cancer.
   --Rad onc involved and plan for initiation of XRT pending
   decision-making ( may be transferring patient east for radiation
   oncology assessment and treatment)
   --Oncology following
 per onc, no need for chemo prior to radiation
   --f/up palliative care recs, appreciate input
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation for 5 days. Extubated
   successfully on [**3-9**] and on 4L NC. Patient stopped on steroids yesterday
   - continue abx for possible PNA (levo/flagyl day 1=[**3-3**], today day
   [**9-13**]), can discontinue today
   - NC O2 to keep O2 sats >88%
   --Start atrovent nebs
   # Weakness over right UE/LE :
   Suspect this is due to L parietal lesion. No changes. No mass effect
   from brain mass
   -- serial neuro recs
   .
   # MS Change: Unclear baseline. Improving slowly
   -- neuro involved
   -- follow neuro exam
   -- EEG w/ slowing

   # Testicular mass: Has nodularity in right scrotum which was not
   consistent with any metastatic mass
   .
   # Schizoaffective disorder:
   -- continue home psych meds
   -- psych following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Now back to normal range. DDX includes med effect, bone marrow
   suppression with known  malignancy vs. infection. Not on any heparin at
   this time

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, alcoholism, who presents with atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response following a recent fall. Imaging has ruled out intracranial bleeding but revealed a left parietal brain mass. The patient also has evidence of likely primary squamous cell lung cancer based on additional workup and biopsies.

In the ICU, the patient has experienced various medical complications. These include:
1. Non-stable ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), for which amiodarone loading was started. However, due to amiodarone load, the medication had to be called back in. The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus tachycardia.
2. Testicular ultrasound without evidence of malignancy, with skin/subcutaneous calcification noted.
3. Thrombocytopenia, which is now back to normal range. Differential diagnosis includes medication effect, bone marrow suppression with known malignancy, or infection.
4. Weakness over the right upper extremity and lower extremity, suspected to be due to a left parietal lesion. No changes or mass effect from the brain mass have been observed.
5. Hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation for 5 days. The patient was successfully extubated on [**3-9**] and is currently"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU with atrial flutter, intracranial lesion, and lung mass. He has been intubated for 5 days and is now on a nasal cannula with oxygen to maintain O2 saturation above 88%. The patient has shown some autodiuresis and continues to receive antibiotics for possible pneumonia. He has a left-sided weakness suspected to be due to a left parietal lesion. Serial neurologic examinations are planned, and he will continue on prednisone. A follow-up final read MRI is also planned. The patient has a history of lung cancer with a preliminary pathology report indicating squamous cell carcinoma. He underwent a left bronchial stent placement and will be transferred to an oncology center for radiation therapy assessment. No chemotherapy is needed before radiation. The patient's myasthenia syndrome is improving slowly, and an EEG with slowing has been performed. Additionally, there is a concern for metastasis in the right testicle, and a testicular ultrasound has been done for further characterization. The patient's atrial flutter has improved with verapamil, and he will continue on this medication. His thrombocytopenia has resolved, and a differential diagnosis includes medication effect, malignancy, and infection. The patient's disposition is to be determined once a bed becomes available at another medical facility."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yoM w/ a h/o schizoaffective disorder presents s/p fall with atrial
   flutter with a rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and
   lung mass who  has new dx of squamous cell lung cancer with extension
   into left atrium.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation for 5 days. Extubated
   successfully on [**3-9**] and on 4L NC. Patient has had some autodiuresis but
   now negative 300-400cc overall
   - continue abx for possible PNA (levo/flagyl day 1=[**3-5**], today day [**7-14**])
   - NC O2 to keep O2 sats >88%
   # Weakness over right UE/LE :
   Suspect this is due to L parietal lesion
   -- serial neuro recs
   -- continue prednisone (would do at least 5 days for COPD but clarify
   neuro recs on need for steroid course for brain lesion)
   -- follow up final read MRI
   -- follow up neuro recs.
   .
   # L hilar mass/Brain Mass:  Given recent imaging and lung sample biopsy
   this is likely an advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer. He is now
   recovering  well after recent left bronchial stent.  Also has left
   atrial mass which is a probable extension of his underlying lung
   cancer.
   --Rad onc involved and plan for initiation of XRT pending
   decision-making ( may be transferring patient east for radiation
   oncology assessment and treatment)
   --Oncology following
 per onc, no need for chemo prior to radiation
   --f/up palliative care recs, appreciate input
   .
   # MS Change: Unclear baseline. Improving slowly
   -- neuro involved
   -- follow neuro exam
   -- EEG w/ slowing
   .
   # Testicular mass: Has nodularity in right scrotum
   Concern for mets given known lung CA
   - Testicular u/s for further characterization
   .
   # Atrial & Ventricular Ectopy :  recent atrial flutter had been
   improving until last night when he had some worse breakthrough runs of
   aflutter so his Verapamil was uptitrated to ough 80 TID dosing dropping
   pressures.
   --Cont with Verapamil 40mg TID
   .
   # Schizoaffective disorder:
   -- continue home psych meds
   -- psych following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Now back to normal range. DDX includes med effect, malignancy,
   infection. Not on any heparin
   - continue to trend CBC daily
   .
   # Dispo- to OMED once bed available

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder and alcoholism, presenting with atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response after a recent fall. Imaging showed a lesion in the brain, and a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer was made. The patient has been experiencing non-stable vital signs, including tachycardia and hypotension. He has been receiving amiodarone for atrial flutter and verapamil for ventricular ectopy. The patient has a history of COPD and is being treated with prednisone. He also has a left atrial mass, which is likely an extension of his underlying lung cancer. Radiation oncology is involved in the treatment plan, and the patient may be transferred for radiation assessment and treatment. The patient's testicular mass is concerning for metastasis given the known lung cancer. He underwent a testicular ultrasound for further characterization. The patient's mental status is improving slowly, and an EEG showed slowing. He has a history of thrombocytopenia, but it has since normalized. The patient is dispositioned to OMED once a bed becomes available.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure due to the extension of lung cancer into the left atrium.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yoM w/ a h/o schizoaffective disorder presents s/p fall with atrial
   flutter with a rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and
   lung mass who  has new dx of squamous cell lung cancer with extension
   into left atrium.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation for 5 days. Extubated
   successfully on [**3-9**] and on 4L NC. Patient has had some autodiuresis but
   now negative 300-400cc overall
   - continue abx for possible PNA (levo/flagyl day 1=[**3-5**], today day [**7-14**])
   - NC O2 to keep O2 sats >88%
   # Weakness over right UE/LE :
   Suspect this is due to L parietal lesion
   -- serial neuro recs
   -- continue prednisone (would do at least 5 days for COPD but clarify
   neuro recs on need for steroid course for brain lesion)
   -- follow up final read MRI
   -- follow up neuro recs.
   .
   # L hilar mass/Brain Mass:  Given recent imaging and lung sample biopsy
   this is likely an advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer. He is now
   recovering  well after recent left bronchial stent.  Also has left
   atrial mass which is a probable extension of his underlying lung
   cancer.
   --Rad onc involved and plan for initiation of XRT pending
   decision-making ( may be transferring patient east for radiation
   oncology assessment and treatment)
   --Oncology following
 per onc, no need for chemo prior to radiation
   --f/up palliative care recs, appreciate input
   .
   # MS Change: Unclear baseline. Improving slowly
   -- neuro involved
   -- follow neuro exam
   -- EEG w/ slowing
   .
   # Testicular mass: Has nodularity in right scrotum
   Concern for mets given known lung CA
   - Testicular u/s for further characterization
   .
   # Atrial & Ventricular Ectopy :  recent atrial flutter had been
   improving until last night when he had some worse breakthrough runs of
   aflutter so his Verapamil was uptitrated to 120mg TID
   --continue close BP monitoring  on higher  verapamil dose
   -- amiodarone loaded overnight, switch to maintenance dosing
   .
   # Schizoaffective disorder:
   -- continue home psych meds
   -- psych following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Now back to normal range. DDX includes med effect, bone marrow
   suppression with known  malignancy vs. infection. Not on any heparin at
   this time
   - continue to trend CBC daily
   .
   # Dispo- to OMED once cardiac ectopy stabilizes and pending bed

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, ETOH (alcoholism), who presents with atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response after a recent fall. Imaging has ruled out intracranial bleeding but revealed a left parietal brain mass. The patient also has evidence of likely primary squamous cell lung cancer on additional workup/biopsies.

24-hour events include:
- Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry with occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia, prompting initiation of amiodarone loading followed by maintenance dosing due to breakthrough atrial flutter.
- Titration up of verapamil.
- Testicular ultrasound without evidence of malignancy, but with skin/subcutaneous calcification.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

Medications:
- Amiodarone infusion at 0.5 mg/min.
- Other ICU medications include amiodarone, verapamil, famotidine (Pepcid), and levofloxacin.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo M schizoaffective disorder here with new diagnosis metastatic
   squamous cell carcinoma, course complicated by arryhtmia, respiratory
   failure
   1. Respiratory failure: continues to have 4L O2 requirement with
   productive cough, likely [**1-7**] mass and post-obstructive pneumonia
    - cont standing and prn atrovent
    - completed steriods
    - complete course levaquin and flagyl for possible post-obstructive
   pna, day [**9-13**].
   2. Squamous cell carcinoma:
    - palliative xrt to lung mass
    - will touch base with palliative care regarding further
   decision-making
   3. Aflutter/nsvt: [**1-7**] atrial mass, less responsive to verapamil
    - cont verapamil and amiodarone for now
    - will need to clarify goals of care with patient and health care
   proxy: chest compressions would likely be of greater risk than benefit,
   but at this moment attempted dccv in setting of sustained VT would not
   be contra-indicated, although this would not fix the underlying source
   of arrythmia which is most likely the mass in his right atrium

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder who initially presented with a fall. The workup revealed a hilar mass extending into the pulmonary veins and right atrium, along with brain metastases, pathology confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), as well as respiratory failure. The patient is currently extubated and receiving respiratory support with 4 liters of oxygen.

The patient has been started on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation/flutter and verapamil for rate control. He is also on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and troponin T. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to the [**1-7**] mass and post-obstructive pneumonia. The plan is to continue standing and prn atrovent, complete the course of levaquin and flagyl, and consider palliative radiation therapy (xrt) to the lung mass.

The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter is less"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder, who initially presented with a fall. The workup revealed a hilar mass extending into the pulmonary veins and right atrium, with brain metastases, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The hospital course has been complicated by supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), respiratory failure, and guardianship/HCP issues.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 79 bpm (with a range of 79-132 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 92/52 mmHg to 144/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (with a range of 16-25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently extubated.

Physical examination findings include poor dentition, bronchial breath sounds with wheezes on the right side, and muscle wasting. Neurologic examination was not assessed due to the patient's alertness and ability to follow simple commands.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dL, platelet count of 162 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, blood glucose of 104 mg/dL, and sodium of 137 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require 4L of oxygen and has a productive cough, likely due to the lung mass and post-obstructive pneumonia.
   - Continue standing and prn atrovent
   - Complete course of levaquin and flagyl for possible post-obstructive pneumonia, days 9-13.

2. Squamous cell carcinoma: The patient has a new diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
   - Consider palliative radiation therapy to the lung mass.
   - Consult palliative care regarding further decision-making.

3. Aflutter/NSVT: The patient has atrial fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
   - Continue verapamil and amiodarone for now.
   - Clarify goals of care with the patient and healthcare proxy. Chest compressions would likely be of greater risk than benefit. Attempted defibrillation in the setting of sustained VT would not be contraindicated, although this would not fix the underlying source of arrhythmia, which is most likely the mass in the right atrium.

ICU care includes regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, PICC line placement, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and need for restraints reviewed. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the medical floor once amiodarone load is completed. The patient is critically ill."

   -
   53 yoM w/ a h/o schizoaffective disorder presents s/p fall with atrial
   flutter with a rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion, and
   lung mass who  has new dx of squamous cell lung cancer with extension
   into left atrium, and was started on IV amio load overnight.
   .
   # Atrial & Ventricular Ectopy :  recent atrial flutter had been
   improving until last night when he had some worse breakthrough runs of
   aflutter so his Verapamil was uptitrated to 120mg TID with IV boluses
   --continue close BP monitoring  on higher  verapamil dose
   -- amiodarone loaded overnight, switch to maintenance dosing (still on
   IV load)
   # L hilar mass/Brain Mass:  Given recent imaging and lung sample biopsy
   this is likely an advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer. He is now
   recovering well after recent left bronchial stent.  Also has left
   atrial mass which is a probable extension of his underlying lung
   cancer.
   --Rad onc involved and plan for initiation of XRT pending
   decision-making ( may be transferring patient east for radiation
   oncology assessment and treatment)
   --Oncology following
 per onc, no need for chemo prior to radiation
   --f/up palliative care recs, appreciate input
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation for 5 days. Extubated
   successfully on [**3-9**] and on 4L NC. Patient stopped on steroids yesterday

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU after a fall. He has several significant medical conditions, including atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, an intracranial lesion, and a lung mass. The patient has been diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer that has extended into the left atrium. He is currently on IV amiodarone for cardiac rhythm management.

The patient's recent imaging and lung sample biopsy suggest advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer. He underwent a left bronchial stent placement and is recovering well. Radiation oncology is involved in the patient's care plan, pending decision-making. The patient's oncology team does not recommend chemotherapy prior to radiation.

The patient was intubated for five days and successfully extubated on [3-9]. He is now on 4L NC (nasal cannula) and receiving Atrovent nebs. The patient's weakness over the right upper and lower extremities is suspected to be due to a left parietal lesion. There are no changes in the neurologic exam, and the patient's mental status is improving slowly. 

The patient also has a testicular mass, which appears to be unrelated to any metastatic masses. His schizoaffective disorder is being managed with home psych medications, and he is under psychiatric follow-up. The patient's thrombocytopenia has resolved,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who was admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion likely due to a stroke, and lung mass. He has been diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer with extension into the left atrium. The patient's heart rhythm has improved on amiodarone, and he is still on a higher dose of verapamil. Close blood pressure monitoring is continued on the higher verapamil dose. The patient also has a left atrial mass, which is likely an extension of his underlying lung cancer. Radiation oncology is involved, and plans for initiation of XRT are pending decision-making. The patient may be transferring east for radiation oncology assessment and treatment. Chemotherapy prior to radiation is not recommended by oncology. The patient also has an intracranial lesion consistent with an embolic CVA in the left parietal region, causing right-sided weakness. ASA and lipid checks are advised, along with a follow-up neurology evaluation. The patient's depression has worsened, and psychiatric follow-up is recommended. He was previously intubated for five days and successfully extubated on [3-9]. The patient is currently on 4L NC O2 to maintain O2 sats above 88%. Atrovent nebs have been added. The patient's mental status is improving slowly, and neuro involvement is advised."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, who presented to the ICU after falling. He was diagnosed with atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response, an intracranial lesion, and a lung mass. The patient has been started on IV amiodarone and his verapamil dose has been increased. He is currently being monitored closely for any changes in blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial & Ventricular Ectopy: The patient has ongoing episodes of atrial flutter, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. L Hilar Mass/Brain Mass: The patient has advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer with an extension into the left atrium. This can cause respiratory and cardiac issues.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for 5 days and is now on nasal cannula oxygen. He may still be at risk for respiratory failure if oxygen saturation levels drop below 88%.
4. Weakness over right UE/LE: The patient has weakness in his upper and lower extremities, likely due to a left parietal lesion. Regular neurologic evaluations are necessary.
5. MS Change: The patient has an unclear baseline mental status that is improving slowly. Neurological involvement and follow-up are recommended.
6. Testicular Mass: The patient has nodularity in the right scrotum, which needs further evaluation.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/84 mmHg to 92/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36°C.

The patient has diminished breath sounds on the left side and improved rhonchi on the right side. Neurologically, the patient responds to simple commands and has 2/5 strength in the right upper extremity but is unable to express why he is currently in the hospital.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.7 K/uL, and thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 162 K/uL. Kidney function is normal with a creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder who was admitted to the ICU after a fall. He has been diagnosed with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving his heart, pulmonary veins, and mediastinum. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/84 to 92/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on room air and has shown improvement in respiratory failure. However, he still requires mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The patient's cancer is metastasized and involves critical areas such as the heart and pulmonary veins. This increases the risk of further complications related to cancer progression and spread.
2. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient has been diagnosed with SVT, which is currently stable. The treatment plan includes continuing verapamil and amiodarone. If left untreated or uncontrolled, SVT can lead to palpitations, chest pain, fainting, and in severe cases, can be life-threatening.
3. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient's neurologic examination shows decreased strength on the right upper extremity, and the head CT reveals a phenomenon consistent with an embolic event. The treatment"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a fall. The patient has several medical conditions, including atrial flutter, intracranial lesion likely due to a cerebral vascular accident (CVA), lung mass, and squamous cell lung cancer with extension into the left atrium. The patient's recent imaging and lung sample biopsy indicate an advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer. He underwent a left bronchial stent placement and is currently recovering. The patient also has a testicular mass that was not consistent with any metastatic mass.

Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has non-sustained VT, which has improved after receiving IV amiodarone. He is now on oral amiodarone.
2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient has AMS, but it is not delirium. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient had hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation for five days. He was successfully extubated on 3/9 and is currently on 4L NC with NC O2 to maintain O2 saturation above 88%.
4. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has reduced urine output.
5. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm): The patient has squamous cell lung cancer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, and ventricular tachycardia. The patient has experienced several medical events, including an embolic cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and right upper extremity swelling with a clot around the right peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line, leading to its removal and replacement with a left 20g peripheral intravenous (PIV) line. The patient also had a sustained ventricular tachycardia episode and received verapamil. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure, altered mental status, oliguria/anuria, and multiple comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure increases the risk of developing pneumonia due to impaired lung function and potential aspiration.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization in the ICU setting and the presence of cancer increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and invasive lines increase the risk of infection, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or wound infections.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Oliguria/anuria suggests impaired kidney function, which can be caused by various factors such"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The note details the patient's history, medications, vital signs, laboratory results, and ongoing assessments and plans.

The patient has a history of cancer, and the specific type is not mentioned. They have been experiencing altered mental status, respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria (reduced urine output), ventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, pleural effusion, and hypotension.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but their blood pressure is low. Their heart rate is slightly elevated, respiratory rate is increased, and oxygen saturation is normal.

Laboratory results show abnormal values for white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, glucose levels, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), kidney function markers (BUN/Cr), electrolytes (sodium/potassium), and other markers such as LDH, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and albumin.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (metronidazole and levofloxacin), famotidine, verapamil, and haloperidol for agitation. They have also had a PICC line placed and a central venous line removed.

The patient's current plan includes further evaluation of reflux with a gastric emptying study and impedance study, as well as plans to remove the subclavian"

   # RUE clot: Patient in hypercoagulable state, also with LA mass,
   embolic stroke
   - talk to neuro/neuro-onc regarding if any contraindication to
   anticoagulation. If none, start heparin
   # Atrial & Ventricular Ectopy : Likely 2/2 L atrial mass. Will likely
   have continue ectopy but hemodynamically stable. improved after IV amio
   load, now on PO amiodarone. Also on higher verapamil dose.
   --continue close BP monitoring  on higher  verapamil dose
   -- continue PO amiodarone (s/p IV load)
   -- patient will have occasional ectopy, responds to IV verapamil 5mg
   # L hilar mass: Given recent imaging and lung sample biopsy this is
   likely an advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer. He is now
   recovering well after recent left bronchial stent.  Also has left
   atrial mass which is a probable extension of his underlying lung
   cancer.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder admitted to the ICU after experiencing a fall. He has been diagnosed with atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion likely due to a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and a lung mass. The patient has also been diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer that has extended into the left atrium. His condition has improved with the use of amiodarone for heart rhythm control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right Upper Extremity (RUE) Clot: The patient is in a hypercoagulable state and has a left atrial mass, which increases the risk of thromboembolism. It is recommended to consult with neuro/neuro-onc regarding any contraindications to anticoagulation. If none, start heparin.
2. Atrial and Ventricular Ectopy: This is likely caused by the left atrial mass. Close monitoring of blood pressure is advised, especially on higher doses of verapamil. Continue oral amiodarone and ensure hemodynamic stability.
3. Left Hilar Mass: This is likely an advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer. The patient has recovered well after the left bronchial stent placement. Radiation oncology is involved in planning the initiation of radiation therapy.
4. Intracranial Lesion: Per neuro-onc, this is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of schizoaffective disorder and stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has been admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency. He has also been diagnosed with a possible ischemic stroke. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/69 to 137/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,530 mL and a total output of 2,120 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -590 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of pH 7.28.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Insufficiency: The patient's low oxygen saturation of 92% indicates inadequate oxygenation of the tissues. This could be due to underlying lung disease or complications from mechanical ventilation.
2. Ischemic Stroke: The patient has been diagnosed with a possible ischemic stroke, which is characterized by a lack of blood flow to a specific area of the brain. This can lead to neurological deficits and altered mental status.
3. Stage IV NSCLC: The patient has advanced lung cancer that may require"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of schizoaffective disorder and stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. The patient has experienced several medical complications during his stay:

1. Ischemic Stroke: The patient is suspected to have had an ischemic stroke, which could be a result of a paradoxical embolism due to a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right upper extremity caused by a central venous catheter.

2. Atrial/Valvular Mass: There is a mass observed in the left atrium or valve, which may be either a clot or a tumor. This poses a potential source of embolism to the central nervous system.

3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient initially presented with left atrial mass and pulmonary edema, but it improved after placing a stent.

4. Schizoaffective Disorder: The patient has a pre-existing psychiatric condition called schizoaffective disorder, for which he is on a home psych regimen.

5. Nutrition: The patient is receiving a regular oral diet.

6. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood sugar levels are being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.

7. Lines: The patient has had multiple lines inserted, including a 20-gauge line on [**2172-3-13**] at 04:07 PM.

8. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): There are no specific comments regarding VAP in the progress note.

10. Disposition: The patient is ready for transfer to the floor, specifically to [**Hospital Ward Name**], anticipating radiation therapy (XRT).

It is important to note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note and does not substitute for a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional."

   measures a try: chest PT, incentive spironmetry, guafenecin/mucomyst.
   - Check CXR later today
   - If worsening SOB then would favor repeat bronch
   # Suspected stage IV squamous lung CA: Given recent imaging and lung
   sample biopsy this is likely an advanced primary squamous cell lung
   cancer. He is now recovering well after recent left bronchial stent.
   Also has left atrial mass which is a probable extension of his
   underlying lung cancer.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder, ETOH-ism, atrial flutter, recent fall, altered mental status, and extensive squamous cell lung cancer. The patient has experienced several medical complications during their stay in the ICU.

1. Atrial Flutter with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient initially presented with atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response. They were given verapamil for this condition, and their heart rhythm has since improved.

2. Embolic Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient has an intracranial lesion consistent with an embolic CVA in the left parietal region. This has resulted in right upper extremity/leg weakness. The patient is being started on aspirin and will undergo further neurologic follow-up.

3. Partial Collapse of the Left Upper Lobe (LUL) of the lung: The patient's chest X-ray revealed a partial collapse of the LUL. This is suspected to be due to retained secretions, as seen in prior episodes. The patient's respiratory status has improved with conservative measures such as chest physiotherapy and guaifenesin/mucositis.

4. Suspected Stage IV Squamous Lung Cancer: Recent imaging and lung sample biopsy indicate that the patient likely has advanced primary squamous cell lung cancer. The patient has undergone a left bronchial stent placement. Radiation oncology involvement has been sought,"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder and alcoholism, who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, intracranial lesion likely due to a stroke, and a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. The patient's respiratory status has improved since the placement of a left bronchial stent. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's recent episodes of desaturation and coughing suggest the possibility of aspiration events or partial/full stent blockage. There is also mention of crackles over the bases bilaterally and wheeze over the left upper lobe (LUL), indicating potential pneumonia or further lung collapse.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response and an atrial mass, which could contribute to ongoing ectopy. The patient is currently on amiodarone and verapamil for this condition.

3. Neurological complications: The patient has an intracranial lesion consistent with an embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the left parietal region, leading to right upper extremity (UE) weakness. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old man with NSCLC and recent stent to LUL. Desat yesterdqay
   related to new collapse but moving some air in LUL now. O2 stable, IP
   plans bronch in am if he doesn't
   reexapnd with conservative measures. Continue IV heparin for RUE clot
   and atrial clot/mass. Plan is to transfer to onc for palliative XRT.
   Doubt atrial ectopy will totally resolve prior to reduction in hilar
   mass. Agree with remainder of the plan as outlined in resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recent stent placement in the left upper lobe (LUL). He presented with respiratory insufficiency and has stage IV NSCLC. He experienced new LUL collapse overnight, for which heparin was started for a right lower extremity (RUE) clot as well as an embolic cardiac event (atrial mass/clot). The patient has been receiving IV heparin and other ICU medications.

On the flowsheet, his vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 36.2 to 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 99 and 128 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/49 to 150/96 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15 and 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 80.7 kg, with an admission weight of 76 kg. His height is 72 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,422 mL and output of 2,910 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,488 mL. Respiratory support includes delivery through a nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 97%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH at 33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) not provided,"
