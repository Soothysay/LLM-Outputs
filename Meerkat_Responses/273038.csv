   79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer s/p
   chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and
   malnutrition on TPN, who presents with weakness and abdominal pain,
   found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and also hematemesis in the ED
   # Hypotension/Shock: possible etiologies include obstructive from his
   submassive PEs; septic, from possibly a GI (SBP or gastroenteritis)
   source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding.
   - volume resuscitated with 7L NS + 2 units PRBCs in the ED
   - consider placing IJ for CVP monitoring
   - levophed rather than dopamine (due to tachycardia) to keep MAP >= 65
   - trend lactate
   # Hematemesis: possible causes include AVM, gastritis, PUD, erosion of
   metastatic disease, or portal hypertension from portal v thrombosis
   leading to varices. Gen surgery reviewed his CT scans with radiology
   and did not see any compelling signs of vascular invasion or varices
   that would explain his massive hematemesis, although CT has low
   sensitivity for this diagnosis.
   - two large bore PIVs
   - active type and crossmatch 4 units; serial Hct
   - pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
   - GI planning scope in am if stable, otherwise, would need angio for
   localization/hemostasis if rebleeds
   # Bilateral PE: The patient was found on chest CT to have b/l PE. This
   was likely secondary to his procoagulant state secondary to pancreatic
   cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). Anticoagulation is contraindicated [**1-2**]
   massive hematemesis.
   # Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation
   with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided
   intratumoral injections of TNFerade. Given his issues with malnutrition
   and poor functional status further chemo has been deferred.
   - Will speak with his outpatient oncologist in the am.
   # Malnutrition:  The patient was recently started on TPN as dysphagia
   has been a significant problem for him.  His dysphagic is thought to be
   due to malnutrition-related oropharyngeal myopahty.
   - TPN on hold [**1-2**] no access
   - Nutrition consult.
   - Decadron 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] to decrease nausea as well as compazine.
   # Anasarca: The patient is on aldactone and lasix for anasarca that is
   thought to be related to malnutrition. Hold diuretics for now.
   # Diabetes: The patient is on glipizide as an outpatient.  In the ED
   his serum glucose was 363 and he had glucose in his urine, although no
   ketones.
   - Will hold glipizide for now.
   - Monitor sugars with qid fingersticks and cover with SSI.
   # Hyponatremia: Na of 130 on initial labs in the ED; up to 135 after
   volume resuscitation, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia [**1-2**] diuretic use
   at home. Continue to monitor sodium.
   # Depression: Continue remeron.
   # Sacral dcubitus ulcuer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer and
   received VNA-wound care services at home.
   - Will obtain a wound consult.
   # FEN:  TPN and nutrition consult as above
   # Access: Port-a-cath, 2 18g PIVs
   # PPx: pneumoboots (no heparin [**1-2**] bleeding), bowel regimen, ppi as
   above
   # Code: DNR/DNI if he should actually suffer a cardiac or respiratory
   arrest, but full supportive measures including pressors, transfusions,
   and invasive monitoring lines otherwise

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, pancreatic cancer post chemoradiation, recent ascending cholangitis, and malnutrition on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient presents with weakness and abdominal pain, found to have multiple/bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and hematemesis in the emergency department (ED).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypotension/Shock: Possible etiologies include obstructive from his submassive PEs; septic, from possibly a gastrointestinal source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding. The patient has been volume resuscitated with normal saline and packed red blood cells in the ED. Consider placing an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter for central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. Levophed is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than or equal to 65.

2. Hematemesis: Possible causes include arteriovenous malformation (AVM), gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), erosion of metastatic disease, or portal hypertension from portal vein thrombosis leading to varices. A genitourinary (GI) consultation is planned for further evaluation and management.

3. Bilateral PE: The patient has been found to have bilateral PEs on chest CT, likely secondary to his procoagulant state"

   79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer s/p
   chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and
   malnutrition on TPN, who presents with weakness and abdominal pain,
   found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and also hematemesis in the ED
   # Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation
   with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided
   intratumoral injections of TNFerade. Given his issues with malnutrition
   and poor functional status further chemo has been deferred.  After
   discussion with the patient and his family, he has chosen to be made
   CMO.
   - Zofran and prochlorperazine prn for nausea
   - Morphine prn for pain or SOB
   - Trazadone prn for insomnia.
   # Hypotension/Shock: possible etiologies include obstructive from his
   submassive PEs; septic, from possibly a GI (SBP or gastroenteritis)
   source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding. He was volume resuscitated with
   7L NS + 2 units PRBCs in the ED.  He was initially placed on levophed,
   however this was weaned off yesterday when he was made CMO.  His SBPs
   have been stable since this was weaned.
   # Hematemesis: No further evidence of bleeding.  Labs dc
ed given his
   CMO status.  Will continue to monitor.
   # Bilateral PE: The patient was found on chest CT to have b/l PE. This
   was likely secondary to his procoagulant state secondary to pancreatic
   cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). Anticoagulation is contraindicated [**1-2**]
   massive hematemesis.
   # Diabetes: As the patient is CMO, insulin has been DC
ed and no
   fingersticks are being checked.
   # Depression: Continue remeron.
   # Sacral dcubitus ulcuer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer and
   received VNA-wound care services at home.
   - Wound consult with supportive care.
   # FEN:  sips, as he is CMO, if he requests food he can eat as tolerated
   # Access: Port-a-cath, 2 18g [**Last Name (LF) 5258**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pull his A-line today

He presents with weakness and abdominal pain, and was found to have multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and hematemesis in the emergency department.

Assessment and Plan:
- Pancreatic cancer: The patient completed a course of chemoradiation with 5-FU and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic ultrasound-guided intratumoral injections of TNFerade. Given his issues with malnutrition and poor functional status, further chemotherapy has been deferred. After discussion with the patient and his family, he has chosen to be made Comfort Measure Only (CMO).
- Hypotension/Shock: Possible etiologies include obstructive from his submassive PEs; septic, from possibly a gastrointestinal source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding. He was volume resuscitated with 7L Normal Saline (NS) + 2 units packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the ED. He was initially placed on levophed, however this was weaned off yesterday when he was made CMO. His systemic blood pressures (SBPs) have been stable since this was weaned.
- Hematemesis: No further evidence of bleeding. Labs discontinued given"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), pancreatic cancer that underwent chemoradiation, and complications including ascending cholangitis and malnutrition on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient presents with weakness and abdominal pain and was found to have multiple/bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and hematemesis in the emergency department (ED).

The patient's current medical conditions include pancreatic cancer, hypotension/shock, hematemesis, bilateral PE, diabetes, depression, sacral decubitus ulcer, and nutritional support. The patient has chosen to be made a comfort measures only (CMO) patient, meaning no further aggressive treatment will be provided.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of bilateral PE and current respiratory support, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent episode of hematemesis suggests a potential for ongoing or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock.

3. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state, there is an increased risk of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections, or wound infections from the sacral decubitus ulcer.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), pancreatic cancer status post chemoradiation, complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and malnutrition on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient presents with weakness and abdominal pain, and was found to have multiple/bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and also hematemesis in the emergency department (ED).

The patient has chosen to be made a comfort measure only (CMO), meaning he is not receiving active medical treatment aimed at curing his illness. His code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI) and CMO.

The patient's medical conditions include pancreatic cancer, hypotension/shock, hematemesis, bilateral PE, diabetes, depression, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's current medications include Zofran and prochlorperazine for nausea, morphine for pain or shortness of breath (SOB), trazodone for insomnia, and remeron for depression.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
- Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (bpm), with a normal range of 88-104 bpm
- Blood pressure: 104/51 mmHg, with a normal range of 69-124/40-82 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute, with a normal range of 15-25 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 94%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 16.2 thousand/mm3
- Hematocrit: 31.7%
- Platelet count: 280 thousand/mm3
- Blood glucose: 259 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
- Other lab values are within normal ranges or not provided.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise, including:
1. Pancreatic cancer: The patient has a history of pancreatic cancer, which may continue to progress and cause complications such as pain, malnutrition, and potential spread to other organs.
2. Hypotension/shock: The patient's low blood pressure and history of hypotension may indicate ongoing hypotension or shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Hematemesis: The patient's previous episode of hematemesis suggests a possible gastrointestinal bleed, which could recur and require immediate medical attention.
4. Bilateral PE: The patient's bilateral pulmonary embolisms pose a risk for further clot formation and potential complications such as pulmonary hypertension, right heart strain, or recurrent embolic events.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may require careful monitoring and management, especially considering his CMO status and"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer s/p
   chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and
   malnutrition on TPN, who presents with weakness and abdominal pain,
   found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and also hematemesis in the ED
   # Hypotension/Shock: possible etiologies include obstructive from his
   submassive PEs; septic, from possibly a GI (SBP or gastroenteritis)
   source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding.
   - volume resuscitated with 7L NS + 2 units PRBCs in the ED
   - consider placing IJ for CVP monitoring
   - levophed rather than dopamine (due to tachycardia) to keep MAP >= 65
   - trend lactate
   # Hematemesis: possible causes include AVM, gastritis, PUD, erosion of
   metastatic disease, or portal hypertension from portal v thrombosis
   leading to varices. Gen surgery reviewed his CT scans with radiology
   and did not see any compelling signs of vascular invasion or varices
   that would explain his massive hematemesis, although CT has low
   sensitivity for this diagnosis.
   - two large bore PIVs
   - active type and crossmatch 4 units; serial Hct
   - pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
   - GI planning scope in am if stable, otherwise, would need angio for
   localization/hemostasis if rebleeds
   # Bilateral PE: The patient was found on chest CT to have b/l PE. This
   was likely secondary to his procoagulant state secondary to pancreatic
   cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). Anticoagulation is contraindicated [**1-2**]
   massive hematemesis.
   # Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation
   with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided
   intratumoral injections of TNFerade. Given his issues with malnutrition
   and poor functional status further chemo has been deferred.
   - Will speak with his outpatient oncologist in the am.
   # Malnutrition:  The patient was recently started on TPN as dysphagia
   has been a significant problem for him.  His dysphagic is thought to be
   due to malnutrition-related oropharyngeal myopahty.
   - TPN on hold [**1-2**] no access
   - Nutrition consult.
   - Decadron 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] to decrease nausea as well as compazine.
   # Anasarca: The patient is on aldactone and lasix for anasarca that is
   thought to be related to malnutrition. Hold diuretics for now.
   # Diabetes: The patient is on glipizide as an outpatient.  In the ED
   his serum glucose was 363 and he had glucose in his urine, although no
   ketones.
   - Will hold glipizide for now.
   - Monitor sugars with qid fingersticks and cover with SSI.
   # Hyponatremia: Na of 130 on initial labs in the ED; up to 135 after
   volume resuscitation, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia [**1-2**] diuretic use
   at home. Continue to monitor sodium.
   # Depression: Continue remeron.
   # Sacral dcubitus ulcuer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer and
   received VNA-wound care services at home.
   - Will obtain a wound consult.
   # FEN:  TPN and nutrition consult as above
   # Access: Port-a-cath, 2 18g PIVs
   # PPx: pneumoboots (no heparin [**1-2**] bleeding), bowel regimen, ppi as
   above
   # Code: DNR/DNI if he should actually suffer a cardiac or respiratory
   arrest, but full supportive measures including pressors, transfusions,
   and invasive monitoring lines otherwise
   # Dispo: ICU
   # Comm: with patient

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is at risk for hypotension and shock due to possible causes such as obstructive from submassive pulmonary embolisms (PEs), septic from a gastrointestinal source, or hypovolemic from bleeding. The patient has already been volume resuscitated with normal saline and red blood cells.

2. Hematemesis: The patient has experienced massive hematemesis, which can be caused by various factors such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), erosion of metastatic disease, or portal hypertension leading to varices. Further evaluation and management are needed to identify the exact cause and provide appropriate treatment.

3. Bilateral PE: The patient has bilateral pulmonary embolisms, likely secondary to his procoagulant state due to pancreatic cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). Anticoagulation is contraindicated due to the recent massive hematemesis.

4. Pancreatic cancer: The patient has completed a course of chemoradiation but further chemotherapy has been deferred due to malnutrition and poor functional status. The patient's pancreatic cancer requires ongoing management and coordination with the outpatient oncologist.

5. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished and has been started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly individual with end-stage pancreatic cancer who has chosen comfort measures only and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range and a slightly low blood pressure. The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are within acceptable limits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. The liver enzymes are within normal limits, but there are abnormalities in kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress and clear breath sounds. However, peripheral pulses and neurologic assessments were not performed. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's medical history is significant for end-stage pancreatic cancer, for which they have chosen comfort measures only. The patient also had pulmonary embolisms previously, which were treated with heparin. Other past medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include further deterioration of kidney function, development of pressure ulcers due to immobility, and potential infections due to the presence of indwelling lines and catheters. Additionally, the patient's comfort measures only approach may increase the risk of untreated pain and symptoms associated with their underlying malignancy."
