   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6349**] is a 55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to
   RCAx3 transferred from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS,
   and ARF.
   # Sepsis: In setting of high grade bacteremia. Patient transiently on
   levophed overnight. Also received volume rescucitation with 4.5 L IVF.
   - Wean pressors, goal MAP>65
   - Monitor UOP, goal UOP>30 cc/hr. Bolus as needed
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo, d/c ceftriaxone
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Can check SvO2
   # ID: Patient with high grade bacteremia (4/4 bottles with GPCs) and
   report of wound culture with S.aureus with sensitivities unknown.
   Given that no other source identified, source may be diabetic foot
   ulcer/osteo. No CVL access in terms of line infections.  Would also
   need to consider endocarditis as source of infection.  Meningitis also
   considered given AMS, although LP deferred given difficulty with
   sedation.
   - Continue vancomycin, pip/tazo.
   - Low suspicion for meningitis, as patient was already hospitalized for
   4 days and a nosocomial meningitis is unlikely. Defer LP for now and
   hold CNS dosed ceftriaxone.
   - Surface echocardiogram today
   - Follow-up final foot plain film read
   - Trend WBC and fever
   - Consult podiatry
   # Neuro: CTH overnight negative for acute intracranial process. Likely
   multifactorial given high grade sepsis/bacteremia, ARF, and excessive
   narcotic use.
   - As above, continue vanco and pip/tazo
   - Defer LP and d/c ceftriaxone as suspicion for meningitis low
   - Follow-up neuro recs if any
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Appreciate neuron recs, EEG today
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up to 4.8 from 1.3 at OSH. Differential
   includes contrast induced nephropathy, pre-renal, AIN in setting of
   antibiotic therapy, and ATN given sepsis.  FeNa 1.1 with negative urine
   eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric with 4.5L IVF challenge
   overnight.
   - Renal U/S
   - Trend UOP and creatinine
   - Renal c/s
   - Obtain [**Hospital1 49**] path records.
   - Minotr UOP
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS and ?seizure for
   airway protection.  P/F <200, although patient does not have classic
   bilateral infiltrates. He also has a history of CAD, and in setting of
   volume challenge may have element of heart failure, making ARDS
   clinical diagnosis unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] volume ARDS settings for now.
   - Daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate
   - Head of the bed elevated
   - H2 blocker while intubated
   - VAP bundle
   # Ileus: Demonstrated on OSH imaging. KUB wetread with distended
   transverse colon of 12 cm.  Most likely etiology is excessive narcotic
   use as patient was on high doses of MS Contin as an outpatient and
   continued to take narcotics at the OSH.
   - PO Naloxone
   - OGT to low-intermitent suction
   - NPO
   - Hold narcotics
   - Upload OSH imaging and review with radiology.
   - Repeat KUB, if transverse colon >10 cm, consult general surgery.
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS while with infection.
   - Insulin gtt
   .
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin
   - Hold Ace/[**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of ARF
   .
   # Gout
   - Renally dose Allopurinol
   FEN: NPO, IVF, replete as necessary
   PPx: Heparin SQ, H2B, bowel regimen.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who presented to the emergency department with high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure. He was transferred from an outside hospital for further management.

The patient's current condition includes sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), ileus, and diabetes mellitus. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient is also receiving vasopressor support with levophed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 4.6 to 4.8 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 0.8 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci (GPCs).

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Sepsis: The patient is on appropriate antibiotics, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and will continue these medications. Pressors will be weaned once mean arterial pressure ("

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6349**] is a 55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to
   RCAx3 transferred from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS,
   and ARF.
   # ID: Patient with high grade bacteremia (4/4 bottles with GPCs) and
   report of wound culture with S.aureus with sensitivities unknown.
   Given that no other source identified, source may be diabetic foot
   ulcer/osteo. No CVL access in terms of line infections.  Would also
   need to consider endocarditis as source of infection.  Meningitis also
   considered given AMS, although LP deferred given difficulty with
   sedation.
   - Continue vancomycin, pip/tazo.
   - Low suspicion for meningitis, as patient was already hospitalized for
   4 days and a nosocomial meningitis is unlikely. Defer LP for now and
   hold CNS dosed ceftriaxone.
   - Surface echocardiogram today
   - Follow-up final foot plain film read
   - Trend WBC and fever
   # Neuro: CTH overnight negative for acute intracranial process. Likely
   multifactorial given high grade sepsis/bacteremia, ARF, and excessive
   narcotic use.
   - As above, continue vanco and pip/tazo
   - Defer LP and d/c ceftriaxone as suspicion for meningitis low
   - Follow-up neuron recs if any
   - serial neuron exams
   - Appreciate neuron recs, EEG today
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up to 4.8 from 1.3 at OSH. Differential
   includes contrast induced nephropathy, pre-renal, AIN in setting of
   antibiotic therapy, and ATN given sepsis.  FeNa 1.1 with negative urine
   eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric with 4.5L IVF challenge
   overnight.
   - Renal U/S
   - Trend UOP and creatinine
   - Consider renal c/s
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS and ?seizure for

   - Daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate
   - Head of the bed elevated
   - H2 blocker while intubated
   - VAP bundle
   # Ileus: Demonstrated on OSH imaging. KUB wetread with distended
   transverse colon of 12 cm.  Most likely etiology is excessive narcotic
   use as patient was on high doses of MS Contin as an outpatient and
   continued to take narcotics at the OSH.
   - PO Naloxone
   - NGT to low-continuous suction
   - NPO
   - Hold narcotics
   - Upload OSH imaging and review with radiology.  If CTAP demonstrates
   transition point, consult surgery.
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS while with infection.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction (MI) with stenting to the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient was transferred from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. He is currently receiving invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheter, and arterial line. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and elevated creatinine level indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. ID: The patient has high-grade bacteremia with GPCs and a foot ulcer as the potential source of infection. No other source has been identified, and endocarditis should also be considered. The patient will continue receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.
2. Neuro: The patient's coma is multifactorial due to sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6349**] is a 55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to
   RCAx3 transferred from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS,
   and ARF.
   # Sepsis: In setting of high grade bacteremia.  Levophed off briefly ,
   but back on this AM.
   - Wean pressors, goal MAP>65
   - Continue Nafcillin (MSSA likely from foot)
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   # ID: Patient with high grade bacteremia (4/4 bottles with GPCs) and
   report of wound culture with MSSA.  Source is likely diabetic foot
   ulcer/osteo. No CVL access in terms of line infections.  Would also
   need to consider endocarditis as source of infection.  Meningitis also
   considered given AMS, although LP deferred given likely source of
   bacterimia.  Echo with normal valves. Mild LVH, EF > 55%.  Foot plain
   film read suspicious for osteo.
   - Continue nafcillin.
   - Low suspicion for meningitis, as patient was already hospitalized for
   4 days and a nosocomial meningitis is unlikely. Consider LP although
   has been on abx so unlikely to help r/o meningitis.
   - Trend WBC and fever. Consider TEE if bcx continue to be positive or
   fevers [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 344**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
   - F/u  podiatry and vascular surgery recs
 for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # Neuro: CTH negative for acute intracranial process. Likely
   multifactorial given high grade sepsis/bacteremia, ARF, and excessive
   narcotic use.
   - Consider LP for ?SAH despite nl head ct
   - As above, transitioned to nafcillin for MSSA
   - d/c ceftriaxone as suspicion for meningitis low
   - Follow-up neuro recs if any
   - Serial neuro exams
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up now to 6.5 from 1.3 at OSH. Differential
   includes contrast induced nephropathy, pre-renal, AIN in setting of
   antibiotic therapy, and ATN given sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1
   with negative urine eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric with
   4.5L IVF challenge.  Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   - Trend UOP and creatinine
   - Renal c/s
   - Obtain [**Hospital1 49**] path records.
   - Monitor UOP->may need Hd for fluid overload to help respiratory
   status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS and ?seizure for
   airway protection.  P/F <200, although patient does not have classic
   bilateral infiltrates. He also has a history of CAD, and in setting of
   volume challenge may have element of heart failure, making ARDS
   clinical diagnosis unclear. If needs diuresis will require HD most
   likely as currently anuric in setting of ARF
   - Low volume ARDS settings for now.
   - Daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate
   - Head of the bed elevated
   - H2 blocker while intubated
   - VAP bundle
   # Ileus: Demonstrated on OSH imaging. KUB wetread with distended
   transverse colon of 12 cm.  Most likely etiology is excessive narcotic
   use as patient was on high doses of MS Contin as an outpatient and
   continued to take narcotics at the OSH.
   - PO Naloxone
   - OGT to low-intermitent suction
   - NPO
   - Hold narcotics
   - Upload OSH imaging and review with radiology.
   - f/u Gen [**Doctor First Name **] rec.
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS while with infection.
   - Insulin SS
   .
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin
   - Hold Ace/[**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of ARF
   .
   # Gout
   - Renally dose Allopurinol

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient is being treated with nafcillin for suspected methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection from the foot ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and trends in WBC and fever curve is necessary.
2. Meningitis: Although the patient is already hospitalized, there is a low suspicion for meningitis. However, a lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered to rule out meningitis, especially since the patient has altered mental status.
3. Endocarditis: Given the presence of MSSA bacteremia and a history of intravenous drug use, endocarditis should be considered as a potential source of infection.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely due to sepsis-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function should be closely monitored, and further investigations such as renal ultrasound and urine"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was transferred from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. 

The patient has several medical complications that require attention. These include sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, and constipation. 

For sepsis, the patient is on nafcillin and Levophed. Pressors should be weaned off once the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is above 65, and the patient's urine output should be monitored with a goal of at least 30 cc/hr. 

In terms of identification of the source of infection, the patient has high-grade bacteremia with MSSA, and it is likely originating from a diabetic foot ulcer. No central line access has been identified as a source of infection. An echocardiogram showed normal valves, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and an ejection fraction greater than 55%. 

Regarding the neurological assessment, a CT head scan was negative for acute intracranial processes. The altered mental status is likely multifactorial due to sepsis/bacteremia, acute renal failure, and excessive narcotic use. 

The patient's renal function is deteriorating with a creatinine level of 6.5 from 1.3 at the transferring hospital. The differential"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia and a foot ulcer with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). There is a need to consider endocarditis as a potential source of infection, and meningitis is also being considered due to AMS. However, a lumbar puncture (LP) has been deferred for now.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to AMS and possible seizure for airway protection. His PaO2/FiO2 ratio is less than 200, but without classic bilateral infiltrates. There is uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.3 to 4.8, indicating worsening renal function. The differential diagnosis includes contrast-induced nephropathy, pre-renal azotemia, allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN), and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis. The patient"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6349**] is a 55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to
   RCAx3 transferred from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS,
   and ARF.
   # Sepsis: In setting of high grade bacteremia
   - Wean pressors, goal MAP>65
   - Monitor UOP, goal UOP>30 cc/hr. Bolus as needed
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo, d/c ceftriaxone
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   # ID: Patient with high grade bacteremia (4/4 bottles with GPCs) and
   report of wound culture with MSSA.  Source is likely diabetic foot
   ulcer/osteo. No CVL access in terms of line infections.  Would also
   need to consider endocarditis as source of infection.  Meningitis also
   considered given AMS, although LP deferred given likely source of
   bacterimia.
   - Continue nafcillin.
   - Low suspicion for meningitis, as patient was already hospitalized for
   4 days and a nosocomial meningitis is unlikely. Defer LP for now and
   hold CNS dosed ceftriaxone.
   - Surface echocardiogram today
   - Follow-up final foot plain film read
   - Trend WBC and fever
   - Consult podiatry
   # Neuro: CTH overnight negative for acute intracranial process. Likely
   multifactorial given high grade sepsis/bacteremia, ARF, and excessive
   narcotic use.
   - As above, continue vanco and pip/tazo
   - Defer LP and d/c ceftriaxone as suspicion for meningitis low
   - Follow-up neuro recs if any
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Appreciate neuron recs, EEG today
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up to 4.8 from 1.3 at OSH. Differential
   includes contrast induced nephropathy, pre-renal, AIN in setting of
   antibiotic therapy, and ATN given sepsis.  FeNa 1.1 with negative urine
   eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric with 4.5L IVF challenge
   overnight.
   - Renal U/S
   - Trend UOP and creatinine
   - Renal c/s
   - Obtain [**Hospital1 49**] path records.
   - Minotr UOP
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS and ?seizure for
   airway protection.  P/F <200, although patient does not have classic
   bilateral infiltrates. He also has a history of CAD, and in setting of
   volume challenge may have element of heart failure, making ARDS
   clinical diagnosis unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] volume ARDS settings for now.
   - Daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate
   - Head of the bed elevated
   - H2 blocker while intubated
   - VAP bundle
   # Ileus: Demonstrated on OSH imaging. KUB wetread with distended
   transverse colon of 12 cm.  Most likely etiology is excessive narcotic
   use as patient was on high doses of MS Contin as an outpatient and
   continued to take narcotics at the OSH.
   - PO Naloxone
   - OGT to low-intermitent suction
   - NPO
   - Hold narcotics
   - Upload OSH imaging and review with radiology.
   - Repeat KUB, if transverse colon >10 cm, consult general surgery.
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS while with infection.
   - Insulin gtt
   .
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin
   - Hold Ace/[**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of ARF
   .
   # Gout
   - Renally dose Allopurinol
   FEN: NPO, IVF, replete as necessary
   PPx: Heparin SQ, H2B, bowel regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia and signs of infection, which puts him at risk for sepsis. He is already showing signs of organ dysfunction, making it a severe case.

2. Organ Failure: The patient is experiencing ARF, and there is a concern for the potential failure of other organs such as the heart, liver, and lungs.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a foot ulcer, which increases the risk of further skin breakdown and potential infections.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 puts him at risk for hyperglycemia, especially during times of stress and infection.

5. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which may be due to excessive narcotic use and prolonged bed rest.

6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for potential complications related to prolonged intubation,"

- The patient is a 72-inch tall male with a weight of 180 lbs.
- The patient has a history of MSSA infection in the foot ulcer and osteoarthritis in the left first toe.
- The patient has undergone a CT scan and ultrasound, which showed dilated transverse colon dilation.
- The patient has acute renal failure likely due to sepsis.
- The patient's neurological status is concerning, and a lumbar puncture was strongly recommended but deferred for now.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, constipation, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hyperglycemia, and hyperkalemia.
- The patient has an arterial line and multi-lumen line inserted.
- The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and stress ulcer medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a risk of worsening kidney injury. Monitoring urine output, electrolyte imbalances, and adjusting fluid management is crucial.
3. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and source control are essential.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin"

   - Continue Nafcillin (MSSA likely from foot)
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   # ID: Patient with high grade bacteremia (4/4 bottles with GPCs) and
   report of wound culture with MSSA.  Source is likely diabetic foot
   ulcer/osteo. No CVL access in terms of line infections.  Would also
   need to consider endocarditis as source of infection.  Meningitis also
   considered given AMS, although LP deferred given likely source of
   bacterimia.  Echo with normal valves. Mild LVH, EF > 55%.  Foot plain
   film read suspicious for osteo.
   - Continue nafcillin.
   - Low suspicion for meningitis, as patient was already hospitalized for
   4 days and a nosocomial meningitis is unlikely. Consider LP although
   has been on abx so unlikely to help r/o meningitis.

   includes contrast induced nephropathy, pre-renal, AIN in setting of
   antibiotic therapy, and ATN given sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1
   with negative urine eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric with
   4.5L IVF challenge.  Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   - Trend UOP and creatinine

   - Obtain [**Hospital1 49**] path records.
   - Monitor UOP->may need Hd for fluid overload to help respiratory
   status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS and ?seizure for
   airway protection.  P/F <200, although patient does not have classic
   bilateral infiltrates. He also has a history of CAD, and in setting of
   volume challenge may have element of heart failure, making ARDS
   clinical diagnosis unclear. If needs diuresis will require HD most

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. He was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has ongoing sepsis with suspected MSSA infection from a diabetic foot ulcer. There is also concern for possible endocarditis, meningitis, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is intubated due to AMS and respiratory failure, with unclear distinction between ARDS and heart failure. He has acute kidney injury with worsening creatinine levels and anuria. Other issues include ileus, hyperglycemia, and a history of coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia and signs of sepsis. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and closely monitor vital signs and laboratory values.
2. Diabetic Foot Ulcer: The source of MSSA infection is likely the patient's diabetic foot ulcer. Proper wound care and management are essential to prevent further complications.
3. Endocarditis: Considering the patient's history of CAD and the presence of bacteremia, endocarditis should be considered as a potential source of infection.
4. Meningitis: Although the likelihood of nosocomial meningitis is low, it should still be considered given the patient's"

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known Last Name 6349**], a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and drug-eluting stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA), was transferred from another hospital (OSH) for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia and is showing signs of severe infection. Immediate management should include weaning off Levophed, maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65, continuing nafcillin (since MSSA is likely from the foot ulcer), and monitoring the white blood cell (WBC) and fever curve.

2. Infectious Disease (ID): Considering the patient's high-grade bacteremia and report of wound culture with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), it is important to consider endocarditis as a potential source of infection. Additionally, meningitis should be considered given the AMS, although lumbar puncture (LP) is deferred due to the likely source of bacteremia. An echocardiogram with normal valves, mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and ejection fraction (EF) greater than 55% has been done. Foot plain film shows suspicious osteomyelitis. Continue nafcillin and trend WBC and fever. Consider transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) if blood cultures (bcx) continue to be positive or if fevers persist.

3. Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine is trending up to 7.8 from 1.3 at OSH, muddy brown casts are seen, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is suspected from sepsis and hypotension. FeNa is 1.1 with negative urine eos. The patient continues to be oliguric/anuric. Renal ultrasound without hydronephrosis has been done. Trend UOP and creatinine, obtain renal culture/sensitivity (c/s), and monitor urine output (UOP) to determine if hemodialysis (HD) for fluid overload is necessary.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to AMS and possibly a seizure for airway protection. PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio is less than 200, although the patient does not have classic bilateral infiltrates. He also has a history of CAD, and in the setting of volume challenge, may have an element of heart failure, making acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis unclear. If UOP does not improve, diuresis may be required to improve respiratory status. Daily respiratory system bilirubin index (RSBI) and spontaneous breathing trial (SB"

   RCAx3 transferred from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS,
   and ARF.
   # Sepsis: In setting of high grade bacteremia.  Levophed off as of
   early this AM.
   - Wean pressors, goal MAP>65
   - Continue Nafcillin (MSSA likely from foot)
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   # ID: Patient with high grade bacteremia (4/4 bottles with GPCs) and
   report of wound culture with MSSA.  Source is likely diabetic foot
   ulcer/osteo. No Would also need to consider endocarditis as source of
   infection.    Echo with normal valves. Mild LVH, EF > 55%.  Foot plain
   film read suspicious for osteo.  LP showed menigitis
   - Transitioned Abx to CTX, Vanc (dosed by level), and Acyclovir
   - Trend WBC and fever.
   - TEE for ? endocarditis.
   - F/u  podiatry and vascular surgery recs
 for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # Neuro: CTH negative for acute intracranial process. Likely
   multifactorial given high grade sepsis/bacteremia, ARF, and excessive
   narcotic use.
   - IR guided LP
   - As above, transitioned to Abx to cover meningitis
   - Follow-up neuro recs if any
   - Serial neuro exams
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up now to 7.8  from 1.3 at OSH.  Muddy brown
   casts seen and ATN suspected from sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1
   with negative urine eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric.
   Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   - Trend UOP and creatinine
   - Renal c/s
   - Obtain [**Hospital1 49**] path records.
   - Monitor UOP->may need Hd for fluid overload to help respiratory
   status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS and ?seizure for
   airway protection.  P/F <200, although patient does not have classic
   bilateral infiltrates. He also has a history of CAD, and in setting of
   volume challenge may have element of heart failure, making ARDS
   clinical diagnosis unclear. If UOP does not pick up, likely will
   require for diuresis to improve respiratory status.
   - Daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate
   - Head of the bed elevated
   - H2 blocker while intubated
   - VAP bundle
   # Ileus: Demonstrated on OSH imaging. KUB with improved colonic
   distention.  Most likely etiology is excessive narcotic use as patient
   was on high doses of MS Contin as an outpatient and continued to take
   narcotics at the OSH.
   - PO Naloxone
   - OGT to low-intermitent suction
   - f/u Gen [**Doctor First Name **] rec.
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS while with infection.
   - Increase Insulin SS
   .
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin
   - Hold Ace/[**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of ARF

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. He was transferred from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, and ileus. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia and signs of infection. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor vital signs closely.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to sepsis and hypotension. Daily respiratory support and weaning of pressors should be considered.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a rising creatinine level. Renal function should be closely monitored, and further diagnostic tests such as renal ultrasound and urine analysis should be performed.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a foot ulcer that is likely the source of infection. Proper wound care and consultation with a podiatrist and vascular surgeon are recommended.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated. Insulin therapy should be adjusted to maintain glycemic control.

6. Ileus: The patient has demonstrated signs of ileus."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent intensive care unit (ICU) admission for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) and angiography. He was made do not resuscitate (DNR) at a family meeting. The LP cell count was consistent with bacterial meningitis, and the patient was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Ampicillin was not started due to an untreated listeria infection for 5 days. The plan for transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the morning and MRI/MRV head ordered to rule out venous sinus thrombosis per neuro recommendations. The patient desaturated to 88% with decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 80s. He was suctioned, which improved oxygen saturation to 91%, but there were concerns about aspiration given the suctioning of increased bile-colored sputum. The patient coughed up bilious emesis during the LP and had a smaller episode during the day. Levophed was restarted at the lowest dose, and the patient's condition improved to 120s. Arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 68 mmHg. Recruitment maneuvers were attempted, and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased to 17 with worsening, so the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was increased to 70% instead, which improved the patient's condition.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate (HR) of 80 beats per minute, SBP of 146/64 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's height is 72 inches, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg. The patient received fluids totaling 1,752 mL and had blood product transfusions totaling 423 mL. The patient's urine output was 223 mL, and he had nasogastric (NG) drainage of 200 mL. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28.0 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 7.8 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 137 mEq"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient underwent a lumbar puncture and angiography on April 24th.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia and a foot ulcer suspected to be the source of infection. There is a possibility of endocarditis as well.
- Wean pressors and maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
- Continue nafcillin for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) likely from the foot.
- Trend white blood cell (WBC) and fever curve.

2. Infectious Disease (ID): The patient's high-grade bacteremia and wound culture with MSSA suggest a diabetic foot ulcer as the source of infection. An echocardiogram showed normal valves, but there is mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with an ejection fraction >55%. The foot plain film is suspicious for osteomyelitis. The lumbar puncture showed meningitis.
- Transitioned antibiotics to ceftriaxone, vancomycin (dosed by level), and acyclovir.

   - LP cell count c/w bacterial meningitis. Started on vanc, ceftriaxone,
   and acyclovir. WBC not c/w untreated listeria x 5 days so ampicillin
   not started. Plan for TEE in AM. MRI/MRV head ordered to r/o venous
   sinus thrombosis per neuro recs.
   [- KUB: Single loop of prominent air-filled bowel seen in the mid
   abdomen minimally changed since [**2165-4-21**], though the marked
   dilation of the transverse colon seen at that time is no longer
   apparent.]
   - Spoke with family about Renal Cell Carcinoma diagnosis. Apparrently
   he has a 2 cm mass without mets on CT torso.  He was planning on
   cryoablation.
   - In PM, desatted to 88% with decreased SBP 80s. Suctioned with
   improvement in O2sats to only 91%, question of aspiration given
   suctioning of increased bile-colored sputum. Of note, seen by RN to
   cough up bilious emesis during LP with subsequent smaller episode
   during day. Restarted on lowest dose levophed with improvement to 120s.
   ABG 7.34/46/84 -> 7.33/44/68. Recruitment maneuvers tried; PEEP
   increased to 17 with worsening so FiO2 increased 50% to 70% instead
   with improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF.
   # Sepsis: In setting of high grade bacteremia.  Levophed off as of
   [**2165-4-24**].
   - goal MAP>65
   - Continue CTX, Vanc (dosed by level), and acyclovir
   - f/u blood and CSF cxs
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   # ID: Patient with high grade bacteremia (4/4 bottles with GPCs) and
   report of wound culture with MSSA.  Source is likely diabetic foot
   ulcer/osteo. No Would also need to consider endocarditis as source of
   infection.    Echo with normal valves. Mild LVH, EF > 55%.  Foot plain
   film read suspicious for osteo.  LP showed menigitis
   - Transitioned Abx to CTX, Vanc (dosed by level), and Acyclovir
   - Trend WBC and fever.
   - TEE for ? endocarditis.
   - F/u  podiatry and vascular surgery recs
 for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # Neuro: CTH negative for acute intracranial process. Likely
   multifactorial given high grade sepsis/bacteremia, ARF, and excessive
   narcotic use.  LP had meningitis
   - As above, transitioned to Abx to cover meningitis
   - Follow-up neuro recs if any
   - Serial neuro exams
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up now to 7.8  from 1.3 at OSH.  Muddy brown
   casts seen and ATN suspected from sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1
   with negative urine eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric.
   Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   - Trend UOP and creatinine
   - Renal c/s
   - Obtain [**Hospital1 49**] path records.
   - Monitor UOP->may need Hd for fluid overload to help respiratory
   status.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS for airway
   protection.  P/F <200, although patient does not have classic bilateral
   infiltrates. He also has a history of CAD, and in setting of volume
   challenge may have element of heart failure, making ARDS clinical
   diagnosis unclear. If UOP does not pick up, likely will require
   dialysis to improve respiratory status.
   - Daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate
   - Head of the bed elevated
   - H2 blocker while intubated
   - VAP bundle
   # Ileus: Demonstrated on OSH imaging. KUB with improved colonic
   distention.  Most likely etiology is excessive narcotic use as patient
   was on high doses of MS Contin as an outpatient and continued to take
   narcotics at the OSH.
   - patient passed flatus and small stool while in IR for LP.
   - PO Naloxone
   - OGT to low-intermitent suction
   - f/u Gen [**Doctor First Name **] rec.
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS while with infection.
   - Increase Insulin SS
   .
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin
   - Hold Ace/[**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of ARF
   .
   # Gout
   - Renally dose Allopurinol

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was transferred from an outside hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. He underwent a lumbar puncture and angiography on the same day. The patient's family meeting was held to discuss his renal failure, meningitis, and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir due to the suspicion of bacterial meningitis. However, ampicillin was not started as the white blood cell count did not suggest untreated listeria infection.

The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with episodes of desaturation and hypotension requiring interventions such as recruitment maneuvers, increased FiO2, and levophed infusion. He also coughed up bilious emesis during the lumbar puncture and had episodes of aspiration.

Further diagnostic tests ordered include an arterial blood gas (ABG), transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance venography (MRI/MRV) of the head to rule out venous sinus thrombosis. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
- Heart rate: 80 bpm (72-88)
- Blood pressure: 146/64 mm"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF with
   meningitis on LP.
   # Sepsis: In setting of high grade bacteremia.  Levophed PRN.
   - goal MAP>60->will reassess pressure goals once MRI done as may change
   in setting of thrombosis
   - Continue CTX, Vanc (dosed by level), and acyclovir
   - f/u blood and CSF cxs
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Because wbc lower than expected in CSF may be treated meningitis in
   which case cultures may be negative
   # ID: Patient with high grade bacteremia (4/4 bottles with GPCs) and
   report of wound culture with MSSA.  Source is likely diabetic foot
   ulcer/osteo. No Would also need to consider endocarditis as source of
   infection.    Echo with normal valves. Mild LVH, EF > 55%.  Foot plain
   film read suspicious for osteo.  LP showed menigitis
   - Transitioned Abx to CTX, Vanc (dosed by level), and Acyclovir
   - Trend WBC and fever.
   - TEE for ? endocarditis.
   - F/u  podiatry and vascular surgery recs
 for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # Neuro: CTH negative for acute intracranial process. LP had
   meningitis. EEG c/w alpha coma which correlates with poor-prognosis and
   concerning for higher-grade brain pathology or venous thrombosis
   - As above, transitioned to Abx to cover meningitis
   - MRI/V today to assess for venous thrombosis in setting of high grade
   meningitis
   - Follow-up neuro recs if any
   - Serial neuro exams
   - responding to pain still so Propofol continued
 follow TGs and
   lipase
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up now to 7.8  from 1.3 at OSH.  Muddy brown
   casts seen and ATN suspected from sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1
   with negative urine eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric.
   Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   - Trend UOP and creatinine
   - Renal c/s
   - will need HD today or tomorrow unless MRI confirms poor prognosis and
   goc change
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS for airway
   protection.  P/F <200, although patient does not have classic bilateral
   infiltrates. He also has a history of CAD, and in setting of volume
   challenge may have element of heart failure, making ARDS clinical
   diagnosis unclear. If UOP does not pick up, likely will require
   dialysis to improve respiratory status.
   - Daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate
   - Head of the bed elevated
   - H2 blocker while intubated
   - VAP bundle
   - Wean FiO2 as able
   # Ileus: Demonstrated on OSH imaging. KUB with improved colonic
   distention.  Most likely etiology is excessive narcotic use as patient
   was on high doses of MS Contin as an outpatient and continued to take
   narcotics at the OSH.
   - patient passed stool this morning
   - PO Naloxone
   - OGT to low-intermitent suction
   - f/u Gen [**Doctor First Name **] rec.
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS while with infection.
   - Increased Insulin SS and baseline insulin with better control of FSBS
   last few checks
   .
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin
   - Hold Ace/[**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of ARF

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent a lumbar puncture and angiography on [**2165-4-24**].
- A family meeting was held to discuss the patient's renal failure, meningitis, and DNR status.
- The patient's LP cell count indicated bacterial meningitis, so they were started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. However, ampicillin was not started due to an untreated Listeria infection for 5 days.
- A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned for the morning, along with an MRI/MRV head to rule out venous sinus thrombosis, as recommended by the neuro team.
- The patient has a history of a single loop of prominent air-filled bowel seen in the mid abdomen since [**2165-4-21**], although the marked dilation of the transverse colon seen at that time is no longer apparent.
- The patient was informed about his diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma and was planning on cryoablation.
- The patient desatted to 88% with decreased SBP in the 80s. They were suctioned, which improved their O2 saturation to 91%. There is a question of aspiration due to suctioning of increased bile-colored sputum. The patient was restarted on the lowest dose of levophed with improvement"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction (MI) and stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient was transferred from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's current condition includes sepsis, meningitis, respiratory failure, ileus, diabetes mellitus, and a history of coronary artery disease post MI. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 17 and FiO2 of 70%. He is sedated and not fully awake.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 274 K/uL, elevated blood glucose of 199 mg/dL, elevated creatinine of 7.8 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 28.0%. Imaging shows a single loop of prominent air-filled bowel seen in the mid abdomen, which has not significantly changed since April 21st.

The patient's plan includes weaning off pressors, continuing nafcillin (assuming methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection), monitoring WBC and fever curve, and performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for endocarditis. The patient's central line, arterial line, and urinary catheter should be removed"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF with
   meningitis on LP.
   # Sepsis: In setting of high grade bacteremia.  Levophed PRN.
   - goal MAP>60->will reassess pressure goals once MRI done as may change
   in setting of thrombosis
   - Continue CTX, Vanc (dosed by level), and acyclovir
   - f/u blood and CSF cxs
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Because wbc lower than expected in CSF may be treated meningitis in
   which case cultures may be negative
   # ID: Patient with high grade bacteremia (4/4 bottles with GPCs) and
   report of wound culture with MSSA.  Source is likely diabetic foot
   ulcer/osteo. No Would also need to consider endocarditis as source of
   infection.    Echo with normal valves. Mild LVH, EF > 55%.  Foot plain
   film read suspicious for osteo.  LP showed menigitis
   - Transitioned Abx to CTX, Vanc (dosed by level), and Acyclovir
   - Trend WBC and fever.
   - TEE for ? endocarditis.
   - F/u  podiatry and vascular surgery recs
 for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # Neuro: CTH negative for acute intracranial process. LP had
   meningitis. EEG c/w alpha coma which correlates with poor-prognosis and
   concerning for higher-grade brain pathology or venous thrombosis
   - As above, transitioned to Abx to cover meningitis
   - MRI/V today to assess for venous thrombosis in setting of high grade
   meningitis
   - Follow-up neuro recs if any
   - Serial neuro exams
   - responding to pain still so Propofol continued
 follow TGs and
   lipase
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up now to 7.8  from 1.3 at OSH.  Muddy brown
   casts seen and ATN suspected from sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1
   with negative urine eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric.
   Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   - Trend UOP and creatinine
   - Renal c/s
   - will need HD today or tomorrow unless MRI confirms poor prognosis and
   goc change
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS for airway
   protection.  P/F <200, although patient does not have classic bilateral
   infiltrates. He also has a history of CAD, and in setting of volume
   challenge may have element of heart failure, making ARDS clinical
   diagnosis unclear. If UOP does not pick up, likely will require
   dialysis to improve respiratory status.
   - Daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate
   - Head of the bed elevated
   - H2 blocker while intubated
   - VAP bundle
   - Wean FiO2 as able
   # Ileus: Demonstrated on OSH imaging. KUB with improved colonic
   distention.  Most likely etiology is excessive narcotic use as patient
   was on high doses of MS Contin as an outpatient and continued to take
   narcotics at the OSH.
   - patient passed stool this morning
   - PO Naloxone
   - OGT to low-intermitent suction
   - f/u Gen [**Doctor First Name **] rec.
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS while with infection.
   - Increased Insulin SS and baseline insulin with better control of FSBS
   last few checks
   .
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and a previous myocardial infarction who was transferred from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, and renal failure with meningitis on lumbar puncture. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia and is likely suffering from sepsis. Antibiotics have been started, but further monitoring of blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures is necessary. The patient's white blood cell count in the CSF is lower than expected, which may indicate treated meningitis.

2. Infective endocarditis: The patient has a history of a diabetic foot ulcer and osteomyelitis, which are potential sources of infection. An echocardiogram has shown normal valves, but a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to rule out endocarditis. The patient's foot plain film also shows suspicious findings for osteomyelitis.

3. ARF (acute renal failure): The patient's creatinine levels have significantly increased from 1.3 to 7.8, and muddy brown casts have been seen on urinalysis. This suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis and hypotension."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital (OSH) for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture (LP).

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:

1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia and is being treated with Levophed (norepinephrine) as needed. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Once the MRI is done, the pressure goals may change if there is evidence of thrombosis.

2. Infectious Disease (ID): The patient has high-grade bacteremia with gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in four out of four bottles. There is also a report of wound culture with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The source of infection is likely a diabetic foot ulcer or osteomyelitis. An echocardiogram (Echo) showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and ejection fraction (EF) greater than 55%. The valves are normal, but there is suspicion for endocarditis. A transesophageal echo (TEE) will be done to further evaluate for endocarditis. Foot plain film shows suspicion for osteomyel"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU due to high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure with meningitis.
- The patient has been treated with antibiotics and antivirals, and has undergone several tests including transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture (LP).
- The TEE ruled out endocarditis, while the MRI showed no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or ischemic event. The LP confirmed bacterial meningitis.
- The patient's renal function has significantly deteriorated, with a creatinine level of 9.8 and oliguric/anuric status. ATN is suspected due to sepsis and hypotension.
- The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200. The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, with potential contributions from AMS, heart failure, or ARDS.
- The patient has a history of CAD and was recently admitted for an inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA).
- Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a foot ulcer.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and hyperglycemia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 127/58 mmHg (with readings ranging from 101/45 to 145/76 mmHg), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but the glucose level is elevated. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory acidosis with compensation. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and antibiotics. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) and the disposition is in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, development of additional infections, complications related to impaired skin integrity, and further deterioration of the cardiovascular"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the ICU for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure with meningitis on lumbar puncture. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, and meningitis.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Meningitis, bacterial: Continue antibiotics to cover meningitis.
2. Constipation (obstipation, fos): Continue medication as prescribed.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Daily respiratory system assessment and spontaneous breathing trial if appropriate.
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): Initiate hemodialysis today, follow-up renal recommendations, and monitor electrolyte levels.
5. Hypotension (not shock): Maintain mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg.
6. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): Continue CTX and Vanc antibiotics, follow-up blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, trend WBC and fever curve, and consider de-escalation of acyclovir if meningitis is confirmed.
7. Impaired skin integrity: Monitor for any signs of infection or breakdown.
8. Hyperglycemia: Improve glycemic control through increased insulin administration.

   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF with
   meningitis on LP.
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia and UTI; source thought
   to be diabetic foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and
   plain film here suspicious for osteo. Now also with meningitis, cx
   pending and staph coag+ sputum. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis. Has
   not been on levophed since [**4-24**]. Pt afebrile with mildly improved
   leukocytosis today.
   - Goal MAP>60; levophed prn
   - Continue Ctx, vanc (dosed by level); d/c acyclovir
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u blood and CSF cx; because wbc lower than expected in CSF, may be
   treated meningitis in which case cx may be negative
   - F/u ID recs
   - F/u podiatry and vascular surgery recs; for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # Neuro: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other intracranial
   process on MRI/MRV. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   - Cont Ctx and vanc as above; d/c acyclovir
   - Follow-up neuro recs if any
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Pain control with fentanyl/midaz
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up now to 9.8 from 1.3 at OSH.  Muddy brown
   casts seen and ATN suspected from sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1
   with negative urine eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric.
   Renal U/S without hydronephrosis. Mild hyperkalemia to 5.5.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - Will need HD today
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS for airway
   protection.  LLL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia. Sputum growing
   coag+ staph. Likely also pleural effusion (he has a history of CAD, and
   in setting of volume challenge may have element of heart failure) as
   10.5L + over LOS; expected to improve with dialysis.  .
   - Afebrile w/ decreasing WBC on vanc/ctx; f/u sensitivities. If
   worsens, consider broadening abx to cover aspiration or HAP
   - HD as above
   - Wean PEEP/FiO2 as able with daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate;
   sedation changed to fentanyl/versed due to hypertriglyceridemia on
   propofol
   - Head of the bed elevated, H2 blocker while intubated, VAP bundle
   # Ileus:  patient passed stool on [**2165-4-26**]
   - Start tube feeds as ileus resolved
   - PO Naloxone
   - Would try to avoid narcotics although on fentanyl/versed currently
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS with infection.
   - Increased Insulin SS and baseline insulin with better control of FSBS
   last few checks
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin
   - Hold Ace/[**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of ARF

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the ICU for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure with meningitis. The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, UTI, meningitis, and pneumonia. He has been treated with antibiotics and has undergone a transesophageal echocardiogram which ruled out endocarditis. The patient's creatinine level is significantly elevated, indicating acute renal failure, and muddy brown casts are seen, suggesting acute tubular necrosis. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there are concerns about possible ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has been intubated due to altered mental status and airway protection. There are also concerns about ileus, hyperglycemia, and cardiovascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of MSSA pneumonia, and there are concerns about possible VAP due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level and oliguric/anuric status suggest AKI, possibly due to sepsis, hypotension, and acute tubular necrosis.
3. Diabetic foot infection: The patient has a foot ulcer, which is a potential source of infection.
4. Meningitis:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the hospital with high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute respiratory failure. He was transferred from another hospital for further management.

The patient's recent events include being placed on hemodialysis (HD), weaning of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), initiation of tube feeding, starting insulin gtt for hyperglycemia, and discontinuation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to aspiration.

Vital signs show that the patient is afebrile with mildly improved leukocytosis. Blood cultures have been obtained, and the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics for suspected methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI), as well as possible meningitis. The source of infection is believed to be a diabetic foot ulcer, confirmed by an MSSA wound culture from the previous hospital.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and there are concerns about pneumonia and pleural effusion. He is currently receiving hemodialysis due to acute renal failure (ARF) with muddy brown casts and anuria. His creatinine level has improved from 9.8 to 8.0 mg/dL after the first HD session.

Other assessments and plans include management of diabetic ketoacidosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), acute renal failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture (LP). 

The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has high-grade MSSA bacteremia and a urinary tract infection (UTI) suspected to be from a diabetic foot ulcer. He also has meningitis, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with worsening creatinine levels and muddy brown casts seen on urinalysis, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is oliguric/anuric, indicating poor urine output. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is needed for dialysis.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to AMS for airway protection. There is a concern for pneumonia with an infiltrate in the left lower lobe (LLL). Sputum culture is growing coag+ staph, indicating a possible respiratory infection. Pleural effusion is also suspected. Weaning off ventilator support will be considered based on daily respiratory system compliance and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of wound infection and sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU for several days, receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about his respiratory status and fluid balance. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests. There are potential medical complications related to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture surveillance is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins. Regular lower extremity assessments and consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy may be needed.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcers. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and providing appropriate prophylaxis are important.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, insulin, and dialysis. There have been some challenges with feeding tubes and wound cultures. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results show signs of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including renal failure, sepsis, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure or death if not managed appropriately.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and the current ventilator settings need to be closely monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Renal replacement therapy may be necessary to manage fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently above normal, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Insulin therapy should be adjusted to maintain tight glycemic control.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections. Proper skin care and repositioning should be implemented to prevent further complications.
6. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, which can be a common side effect of"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF with
   meningitis on LP.
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia and UTI; source thought
   to be diabetic foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and
   plain film here suspicious for osteo. Now also with meningitis, cx
   pending and staph coag+ sputum. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis. Has
   not been on levophed since [**4-24**]. Pt afebrile with mildly improved
   leukocytosis today.
   - Goal MAP>60; levophed prn
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u blood and CSF cx; because wbc lower than expected in CSF, may be
   treated meningitis in which case cx may be negative
   - Continue Ctx, vanc (dosed by level; f/u ID recs
   - F/u podiatry and vascular surgery recs; for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # Neuro: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other intracranial
   process on MRI/MRV. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   - Cont Ctx and vanc as above for now
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Pain control with fentanyl/midaz
   - Neuro signed off
   # ARF: Creatinine trending up now to 9.8 from 1.3 at OSH.  Muddy brown
   casts seen and ATN suspected from sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1
   with negative urine eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric.  S/p
   HD yesterday with improvement in Cr.
   - Plan for HD again today
   - F/u Renal recs
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS for airway
   protection.  LLL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia. Sputum growing
   coag+ staph. Likely also pleural effusion (he has a history of CAD, and
   in setting of volume challenge may have element of heart failure);
   initiated dialysis yesterday and able to lower PEEP but still 10L+ over
   LOS.
   - Afebrile w/ decreasing WBC on vanc/ctx; f/u sensitivities. If
   worsens, consider broadening abx to cover aspiration or HAP
   - Cont HD and pull off volume as tolerated
   - Wean PEEP/FiO2 as able with daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate;
   sedation changed to fentanyl/versed due to hypertriglyceridemia on
   propofol
   - Head of the bed elevated, H2 blocker while intubated, VAP bundle
   # Ileus:  patient passed stool on [**2165-4-26**], restarted on tube feeds
   yesterday
   - KUB ordered but  ileus less likely as able to tolerate tube feeds
   when restarted
   - PO Naloxone
   - Would try to avoid narcotics although on fentanyl/versed currently
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS with infection.
   - Increased Insulin SS and baseline insulin with better control of FSBS
   last few checks
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin
   - Hold Ace/[**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of ARF

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute respiratory failure. The patient also has meningitis, as evidenced by the CSF fluid analysis showing 4+ PML but no microorganisms on gram stain, and the respiratory culture preliminary report indicating coag+ staph, yeast.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm (with a normal range of 70-99 bpm), blood pressure of 157/57 mmHg (with a normal range of 83/47-191/85 mmHg), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 16-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (13.7 K/uL), hemoglobin (8.4 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen (24 mg/dL), creatinine (9.0 mg/dL), and lactic acid (0.6 mmol/L). The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level (3.1 mg/dL). The patient's glucose level is elevated at 161 mg/dL"

   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF with
   meningitis on LP.
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia and UTI; source thought
   to be diabetic foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and
   plain film here suspicious for osteo. Now also with meningitis, cx
   pending and staph coag+ sputum. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis. Has
   not been on levophed since [**4-24**]. Pt febrile last PM, but hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Goal MAP>60; levophed prn
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u blood and CSF cx; because wbc lower than expected in CSF, may be
   treated meningitis in which case cx may be negative
   - Continue Ctx, vanc (dosed by level).
   - F/u podiatry and vascular surgery recs; for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # Neuro: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other intracranial
   process on MRI/MRV. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   - Cont Ctx and vanc as above for now
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Pain control with fentanyl/midaz
   - Neuro signed off
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1 with negative urine
   eos. Patient continues to be oliguric/anuric.  S/p HD yesterday with
   improvement in Cr.
   - F/u Renal recs
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS for airway
   protection.  LLL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia. Sputum growing
   MRSA. Likely also pleural effusion (he has a history of CAD, and in
   setting of volume challenge may have element of heart failure);
   initiated dialysis and able to lower PEEP but still 10L+ over LOS.
   - Continue vanc/ctx. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - Cont HD and pull off volume as tolerated
   - Wean PEEP/FiO2 as able with daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate;
   sedation changed to fentanyl/versed due to hypertriglyceridemia on
   propofol
   - Head of the bed elevated, H2 blocker while intubated, VAP bundle
   # Ileus:  patient passed stool on [**2165-4-26**], restarted on tube feeds
   yesterday
   - KUB ordered but  ileus less likely as able to tolerate tube feeds
   when restarted
   - PO Naloxone
   - Would try to avoid narcotics although on fentanyl/versed currently
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS with infection.
   - Cte insulin gtt
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix. Unclear why patient is not on a BB or statin
   - Hold Ace/[**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of ARF

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction (MI). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), acute renal failure (ARF), and meningitis.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require attention:

1. Meningitis: The patient has bacterial meningitis, as evidenced by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. He is being treated with antibiotics, but further follow-up is needed to monitor his response.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is concern for pneumonia, and the sputum culture is positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The goal is to wean off the ventilator gradually while ensuring adequate oxygenation and respiratory support.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)/Renal Failure: The patient has AKI, likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension. He is oliguric/anuric and receiving hemodialysis (HD). The target is to improve renal function and reduce serum creatinine levels.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a diabetic foot ulcer, which is suspected to be the source of MSSA bacteremia. Proper wound care and"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with admission with MSSA bacteremia and although he had
   significant elevation in CSF WBC count has not had culture positivity
   from CSF.  He, from a respiratory standpoint, has been able to tolerate
   PSV wean but is complicated by some hypertension at this time.
   1) MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
and significant MSSA bactermia
   -Vanco/CTX to continue
   -Will follow up culture results in surveillance
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Versed/Fentanyl used
will need to continue to control pain as possible

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted with MSSA bacteremia and suspected bacterial meningitis. He has been in the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 190/70 mmHg to 123/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 1,947 mL and output of 4,856 mL since midnight. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone), sedatives (Midazolam and Fentanyl), insulin, and heparin sodium. He also requires ongoing respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 800 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (Pa"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and cough. He has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 177/62 mmHg to 201/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including insulin, fentanyl, esmolol, midazolam, hydralazine, metoprolol, and heparin sodium.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on 04/28/2165 at 01:16 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, which is an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This condition can lead to complications such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be due to severe pneumonia or another underlying respiratory condition. This can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which can be caused by severe infection, hypotension, or direct kidney injury. Renal failure may lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently elevated, indicating hypertension. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can cause end-organ damage, such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney disease.

5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and symptoms of systemic infection suggest the possibility of sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection becomes dysregulated, leading to widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction.

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to immobility or pressure ulcers. This can increase the risk of infection and compromised wound healing.

7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia, which can be caused by stress, infection, or inadequate insulin therapy. Hyperglycemia can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or increased risk of infection.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for careful monitoring and management of the patient's condition in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions. The chief complaint is not specified, but the note mentions ongoing issues with hypertension, which has prompted the initiation of esmolol to control blood pressure.

The patient's allergies are noted as no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 04/27/2165 at 12:07 PM and ceftriaxone on 04/29/2165 at 03:58 AM.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including insulin (regular) at 5 units per hour, fentanyl (concentrate) at 60 mcg per hour, and esmolol at 75 mcg per kg per minute. Other ICU medications include midazolam (versed) given on 04/28/2165 at 10:00 AM, hydralazine given on 04/28/2165 at 11:00 AM, metoprolol given on 04/28/2165 at 12:03 PM, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) given on 04/29/2165 at 12:55 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring show the patient to be tachycardic with a heart rate of 82 bpm, with blood pressures ranging from 177/"

   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF with
   meningitis on LP.
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia and UTI; source thought
   to be diabetic foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and
   plain film here suspicious for osteo. Now also with meningitis. TEE
   [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis. Patient off pressors and hypertensive.
   Pt febrile last PM, but hemodynamically stable.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u blood and CSF cx; because wbc lower than expected in CSF, may be
   treated meningitis in which case cx may be negative
   - Continue Ctx, vanc (dosed by level).
   # HTN: started [**2165-4-27**] during dialysis.  Currently spikes up to 210
   Etiologies include pain, essential htn, fever related.  Given
   withdrawal to pain on exam, this is most likely etiology.
   - treat pain with fentanyl, but try not to over-sedate
   - increase metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]
   - Esmolol as needed for quick on/off
   - renal will UF at next HD.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS for airway
   protection.  LLL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia. Sputum growing
   MRSA. Patient vent requirements are minimal despite altered mental
   status.
   - Continue vanc/ctx. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - Cont HD and pull off volume as tolerated
   - Place NG tube for meds and nutrition
   - if still AMS but low vent need, will extubated and feed/meds via NG
   # Neuro: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other intracranial
   process on MRI/MRV. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   - Cont Ctx and vanc as above for now
   - Wean sedation as tolerated by pain
   - Neuro signed off
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - UF today
   - F/u Renal recs
   # Ileus:  patient passed stool, restarted on tube feeds
   - resolved with large BMs as of [**2165-4-26**]
   - monitor for constipation with pain control
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS with infection.
   - Cte insulin gtt
   - transition to Sub-Q heparin
   # L foot ulcer
   - F/u podiatry and vascular surgery recs; for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue ASA/Plavix.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented with high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient was transferred from another hospital for meningitis on lumbar puncture (LP).

The patient has multiple medical complications, including bacterial meningitis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, benign hypertension, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and hyperglycemia.

The assessment and plan include treating the patient's infections with appropriate antibiotics, managing hypertension with medication and renal ultrafiltration, providing respiratory support through mechanical ventilation, and treating acute renal failure with dialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure due to pneumonia or aspiration, further deterioration of renal function leading to end-stage renal disease, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, and complications related to diabetes mellitus such as elevated blood glucose levels or diabetic ketoacidosis.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical condition to promptly address any potential complications and provide appropriate medical interventions."

   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia and UTI; source thought
   to be diabetic foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and
   plain film here suspicious for osteo. Now also with meningitis, cx
   pending and staph coag+ sputum. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis.
   Patient off pressors and hypertensive. Pt febrile last PM, but
   hemodynamically stable.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u blood and CSF cx; because wbc lower than expected in CSF, may be
   treated meningitis in which case cx may be negative
   - Continue Ctx, vanc (dosed by level).
   - F/u podiatry and vascular surgery recs; for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # HTN: started yesterday during dialysis.  Currently spikes up to

s.  Etiologies include pain, essential htn, fever related.  Given
   withdrawal to pain on exam, this is most likely etiology.
   - treat pain with fentanyl boluses
   - start metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]
   - Esmolol for quick on/off
   - renal will UF at next HD.
   # Neuro: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other intracranial
   process on MRI/MRV. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   - Cont Ctx and vanc as above for now
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Pain control with fentanyl/midaz
   - Neuro signed off
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.  FeNa 1.1 with negative urine

   protection.  LLL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia. Sputum growing
   MRSA. Likely also pleural effusion (he has a history of CAD, and in
   setting of volume challenge may have element of heart failure);
   initiated dialysis and able to lower PEEP but still 10L+ over LOS.
   - Continue vanc/ctx. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - Cont HD and pull off volume as tolerated
   - Wean PEEP/FiO2 as able with daily RSBI and SBT if appropriate;
   sedation changed to fentanyl/versed due to hypertriglyceridemia on

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the ICU for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure with meningitis on lumbar puncture. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and stent placement in the right coronary artery. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, benign hypertension, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, which is a serious infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It can lead to complications such as brain abscesses, hydrocephalus, hearing loss, vision loss, seizures, and neurological deficits.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. This condition can lead to further lung infections, atelectasis, and complications related to prolonged intubation such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and vocal cord edema.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed. Complications may include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for high-grade MSSA bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute respiratory failure. The patient also had meningitis on lumbar puncture, but no evidence of acute intracranial pathology on CT head. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, neurologic issues, acute renal failure, ileus, diabetes management, and a foot ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's high-grade MSSA bacteremia and UTI could lead to sepsis, especially considering the presence of a foot ulcer, which may serve as a source of infection. Monitoring vital signs and trends in laboratory values will help identify any signs of systemic infection.
2. Bacterial Meningitis: The patient's LP suggestive of bacterial meningitis should be closely monitored. Even though the CSF culture is negative so far, the possibility of treated meningitis cannot be ruled out. Repeat blood and CSF cultures should be done to ensure appropriate management.
3. Pneumonia: The LLL infiltrate raises concern for pneumonia. The patient's sputum is growing MRSA, which may require broadening antibiotic coverage. Close monitoring of respiratory status and follow-up chest x-rays will aid in managing this condition.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for high-grade MSSA bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), acute renal failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture (LP). 

Key events from the progress note include:

1. Head twitching without movement below the neck. A CT head was ordered, but the evaluation was limited by patient motion, and no acute intracranial pathology was found.
2. Sedation was switched from fentanyl to dexmedetomidine and later stopped because it was not needed. Fentanyl was also stopped, and the patient was started on a fentanyl patch.
3. The patient's blood pressure was high, reaching 180s in the evening, so hydralazine 10mg IV was given. The patient's sedation was increased as well, and metoprolol was uptitrated.
4. The patient had an NG tube placed, but it could not be visualized on abdominal or chest X-ray.
5. The patient had a history of infection with MSSA bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI), and there were concerns about bacterial meningitis, especially since the white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was lower than expected. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) ruled out endocarditis.
6. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) and had muddy brown casts seen, which suggested acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis and hypotension.
7. The patient's ileus resolved after passing stool and restarting tube feeds.
8. The patient's diabetes management included being off insulin gtt and continuing NPH with ISS.
9. The patient's foot ulcer was related to diabetes and required further evaluation by podiatry and vascular surgery.
10. The patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) included a recent myocardial infarction (MI), which was ruled out at the outside hospital.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient had an LLL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia, and sputum was growing MRSA.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for AMS and airway protection.
3. Aspiration: The patient's altered mental status increases the risk of aspiration.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization and other risk factors.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has ARF with muddy brown casts seen, suggesting ATN.
6. Meningitis: The patient had LP suggestive of bacterial meningitis, and CSF cultures were negative.
7. Septic shock: The patient had high-grade MSS"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease who underwent an inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and drug-eluting stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure (ARF) with suspected meningitis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. High-grade MSSA bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI) likely originating from a diabetic foot ulcer.
2. Bacterial meningitis suggested by the lumbar puncture (LP) results, although the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures have been negative so far. Further blood and CSF cultures are planned, and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary.
3. Hypertension that started during dialysis and is managed with beta-blockers.
4. Respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation due to AMS for airway protection. There is also a concern for pneumonia, as indicated by the left lower lobe infiltrate and MRSA growth in sputum cultures.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF) with muddy brown casts seen on urinalysis, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis and hypotension.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF with
   meningitis on LP.
   # Head twitching: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other
   intracranial process on MRI/MRV on [**2165-4-25**]. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head.
   Initial concern for seizures but neuro stated this was unlikely.  Now
   concern for cord issues.
   - MRI of C- ant T-Spine
   - transition to propafol for studies
   # Difficulties from NGT placement: NG tube placed for feeding and meds
   in hopes he can extubated despite continued AMS. Unable to see NGT on
   CXR or Abd X-ray, but appears in place by auscultation.
   - infuse 10 cc of bearcat and redo CXR/KUB for placement.
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia and UTI; source thought
   to be diabetic foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and
   plain film here suspicious for osteo. Now also with meningitis with neg
   cx to date; as WBC lower than expected in CSF, may be treated
   meningitis in which case cx may be negative. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out
   endocarditis. Has been febrile with increased WBC but hemodynamically
   stable; off pressors and hypertensive.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u blood and CSF cx; check C diff
   - Continue vanc (dosed by level) and CTX; Plan will be for 4 weeks of
   tx
   - Would do best with IR guided PICC as well
   .
   # HTN: Started [**2165-4-27**] during dialysis. Etiologies include pain,
   essential htn, fever related.  Better ctrl with pain ctrl and on
   standing beta blocker; now off gtt.
   - Off fentanyl gtt and on home fentanyl patch
   - will give propafol for sedation and hypertension
   - Cont metoprolol 50mg po tid; uptitrate prn
   - Continue UF as tolerated.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated given AMS for airway
   protection.  LLL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia. Sputum growing
   MRSA. Patient vent requirements are minimal despite altered mental
   status.
   - Continue Vanc/ctx. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - Cont HD and pull off volume as tolerated
   - Place NG tube for meds and nutrition
   - Plan to extubate as soon as studies are done, likely tomorrow.
   - okay to re-intubate
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - HD today.
   - will likely need IR guided tunneled cath with PICC.
   # Ileus:  patient passed stool, restarted on tube feeds
   - resolved with large BMs as of [**2165-4-26**]
   - monitor for constipation with pain control
   # DM: Patient likely to have elevated FS with infection; now off
   insulin gtt
   - Cont NPH [**Hospital1 **] with ISS
   # L foot ulcer
   - F/u podiatry and vascular surgery recs; for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.
   # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented with high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He underwent dialysis, intubation, and placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT). The patient has been experiencing episodes of head twitching, which initially raised concerns for seizures or intracranial pathology. However, a CT head showed no acute intracranial pathology, and an MRI of the cervical spine is planned to rule out cord issues. The patient also has an identified source of MSSA bacteremia and UTI, thought to be the diabetic foot ulcer. Additionally, he developed meningitis with negative blood cultures, suggesting possible treated meningitis. Other notable findings include hypertension, respiratory failure with minimal ventilator requirements, acute renal failure (ATN), ileus, and a history of myocardial infarction (MI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient's head twitching could potentially progress to seizures, which may require antiepileptic medication management.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
3. ARF: The patient's acute renal failure requires ongoing renal support and monitoring. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Infection: The patient"

   - Double-lumen PICC placed at bedside
   - Ordered for IR tunneled HD line
   - BP difficult to control; given hydral 10mg x 1; increased sedation.
   - Sedation changed back to propofol for procedures and BP control
   - Stool sent for C. diff given increased WBC
   - MRI C/T spine ordered for evaluation of head twitching (?cord issue)
   and b/l UE weakness; unable to fit into machine so CT spine ordered
   instead. Wet read: Vertebra anatomically aligned. Question of
   hypodensity at the level of T1-T2 measuring 15x9mm which may represent
   epidural hematoma or abscess although appearance may be related to
   artifact from motion. Spine (Neurosurg) c/s'd. Recommended CT myelogram
   for further evaluation; no surgery at this time.
   - ID: No need for CTX. Consider R knee arthrocentesis, R hip and knee
   film for ?capsular swelling to r/o septic arthritis. Also L foot MRI to
   evaluate for osteo. Check ESR, CRP. ?PNA - rec bronch v. mini-BAL for
   cx. If decomp, consider meropenem. If CT spine neg, repeat LP after off
   CTX x 2-3 days.
   - Propofol weaned after imaging. Pt created leak in tubing after biting
   down requiring extubation, which he tolerated well.
   - BP increased substantially to 200 off propofol; uptitrated metop to

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented to the ICU with high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient was previously admitted to another hospital for an inferior myocardial infarction and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery.

The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis based on a lumbar puncture analysis, which showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The source of the infection is believed to be a diabetic foot ulcer, as Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the wound. The patient also has an MSSA bacteremia and urinary tract infection.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by pneumonia, as evidenced by infiltrates on chest X-ray and positive cultures for MRSA. He required mechanical ventilation initially but was successfully extubated after biting through the endotracheal tube cuff.

Other significant findings include acute kidney injury (ATN) likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he has been taken off insulin gtt. His blood pressure is difficult to control despite medication.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with episodes of head twitching. Imaging studies have ruled out venous sinus thrombosis or other intracranial processes. A CT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, bacterial meningitis, acute renal failure, hypertension, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and hyperglycemia. 

The patient underwent several interventions and procedures, including placement of a PICC line, double-lumen PICC, NGT, and arterial line. The patient also received multiple medications and treatments for pain control, infection, and blood pressure management.

The patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 98 to 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 179/71 to 211/86 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's rhythm was sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and other abnormal lab values indicating possible organ dysfunction.

The patient's imaging studies showed a hypodensity at the T1-T2 level, which may represent an epidural hematoma or abscess. The CT myelogram was recommended for further evaluation. The patient's chest X-ray showed no acute changes.

The patient's respiratory support included CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 576"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has signs of meningitis, bacterial infection, and impaired skin integrity, indicating a risk of further infections.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, suggesting acute respiratory failure. This may be due to ARDS or another underlying condition.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure (ARF) and impaired kidney function, which can lead to further deterioration of renal function.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is difficult to control, indicating possible benign hypertension or secondary hypertension due to another underlying condition.

5. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic inflammatory response that can progress to septic shock if not managed promptly.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has consistently elevated glucose levels, indicating uncontrolled diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia.

7. Pain Management: The patient requires pain control for both acute and chronic pain, which should be addressed to ensure patient comfort and prevent complications associated with untreated pain.

8. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and other skin complications.

It is crucial to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to optimize the patient's outcomes and prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia with MSSA, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF
   with meningitis on LP.
   # AMS: Etiologies include meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, structural
   lesion (although neg MRI recently),  sedation effect, benzo withdrawal
   - consider ativan if tachycardic/diaphoretic
   - check ABG
   - Cte to allow sedation to wash out
   - Haldol PRN for agitation if necessary
   # Head twitching: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other
   intracranial process on MRI/MRV on [**2165-4-25**]. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head.
   Initial concern for seizures but neuro stated this was unlikely.  Now
   concern for cord issues.  Reassuring that he is now moving all limbs
   although still delirious.
   - f/u final read of CT of C- ant T-Spine
   - f/u Neurosurgery recs: CT myelogram today if able given asa/plavix
   and sedation issues and try for MRI
   - check abg
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia, UTI, and CSF showed
   meningitis with neg cx (likely treated).; source thought to be diabetic
   foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and plain film here
   suspicious for osteo. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis. Has been
   febrile with increased WBC but hemodynamically stable; off pressors and
   hypertensive.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve. If spikes culture and consider add back
   ctx given recently d/c
d ([**2165-4-30**])
   - Continue vanc (dosed by level)
   - PICC Line in place for long term Abx
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - F/U CVL cultures
   - consider tap knee for ?septic arthritis
   # HTN: Started [**2165-4-27**] during dialysis. Etiologies include pain,
   essential htn, fever related.  Better ctrl with pain ctrl and on
   standing beta blocker.
   - Continue home fentanyl patch
   - Increase metoprolol 75mg po qid; uptitrate prn
   - Continue Hydralizine
   - Continue UF as tolerated for volume
   - Attempt d/c a-line if cuff pressures correlate today
   - consider ACE/[**Last Name (un) 284**] today
   # Respiratory Failure: now extubated.
   - Check ABG now that extubated to ensure adequate oxygenation
   - Continue Vanc. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - okay to re-intubate
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - HD per renal team.
   - will need IR guided tunneled cath -> possibly today.
   # L foot ulcer
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - F/u podiatry and vascular surgery recs; for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention to the right coronary artery. He was transferred from outside hospital for high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture.

The patient's current condition includes:
- AMS with suspected etiologies such as meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, structural lesion (although MRI recently negated), sedation effect, and benzodiazepine withdrawal.
- Head twitching with no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other intracranial process on MRI/MRV, but concern for seizures or cord issues.
- Delirium and agitation managed with haloperidol as needed.
- Bacterial meningitis with negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture, likely treated.
- High-grade MSSA bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and CSF findings consistent with meningitis, likely originating from a diabetic foot ulcer.
- No evidence of endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).
- Fever and increased white blood cell count, but hemodynamically stable off pressors and hypertensive.

   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia with MSSA, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF
   with meningitis on LP.
   # AMS: Etiologies include meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, structural
   lesion (although neg MRI recently),  sedation effect, benzo withdrawal
   - consider ativan if tachycardic/diaphoretic
   - check ABG
   - Cte to allow sedation to wash out
   - Haldol PRN for agitation if necessary
   # Head twitching: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other
   intracranial process on MRI/MRV on [**2165-4-25**]. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head.
   Initial concern for seizures but neuro stated this was unlikely.  Now
   concern for cord issues.  Reassuring that he is now moving all limbs
   although still delirious.
   - f/u final read of CT of C- ant T-Spine
   - f/u Neurosurgery recs: CT myelogram today if able given asa/plavix
   and sedation issues and try for MRI
   - check abg
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia, UTI, and CSF showed
   meningitis with neg cx (likely treated).; source thought to be diabetic
   foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and plain film here
   suspicious for osteo. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis. Has been
   febrile with increased WBC but hemodynamically stable; off pressors and
   hypertensive.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve. If spikes culture and consider add back
   ctx given recently d/c
d ([**2165-4-30**])
   - Continue vanc (dosed by level)
   - PICC Line in place for long term Abx
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - F/U CVL cultures
   - consider tap knee for ?septic arthritis
   # HTN: Started [**2165-4-27**] during dialysis. Etiologies include pain,
   essential htn, fever related.  Better ctrl with pain ctrl and on
   standing beta blocker.
   - Continue home fentanyl patch
   - Increase metoprolol 75mg po qid; uptitrate prn
   - Continue Hydralizine
   - Continue UF as tolerated for volume
   - Attempt d/c a-line if cuff pressures correlate today
   - consider ACE/[**Last Name (un) 284**] today
   # Respiratory Failure: now extubated.
   - Check ABG now that extubated to ensure adequate oxygenation
   - Continue Vanc. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - okay to re-intubate
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - HD per renal team.
   - will need IR guided tunneled cath -> possibly today.
   # L foot ulcer
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - F/u podiatry and vascular surgery recs; for now they will defer
   amputation and await extubation of patient for surgery.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), acute respiratory failure (ARF), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction and drug-eluting stent placement in the right coronary artery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis based on the results of the lumbar puncture. Treatment with antibiotics is ongoing.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure but has now been extubated. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation levels is necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts seen, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Hemodialysis has been initiated per renal team recommendations.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication. Adjustments to the antihypertensive regimen may be required.
5. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of bacteremia and other infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is crucial.
6. Delirium: The patient remains delirious and requires further assessment and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multi lumen stop, blood cultured from the PICC line, and urine culture. The patient has a fever of 101.4°F, which is attributed to expected infection. The patient's sputum CX is ordered, and an IR tunnelled HD line is scheduled for tomorrow. Renal dialysis is planned for [**2165-5-2**]. Neuro surge recommends a CT myelogram or MRI to better define the cord lesion on CT. However, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 937**] indicates that he can see around the cord and feels a CT myelogram would be negative. The patient remains delirious throughout the night and remains hypertensive with cuff pressures of 160s/60s. The arterial line is discontinued. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone on [**2165-4-29**] at 05:24 PM and vancomycin on [**2165-4-30**] at 01:00 PM.

Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Meningitis: The patient has symptoms consistent with bacterial meningitis, including fever, altered mental status, and possible signs of sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure.

   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia with MSSA, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF
   with meningitis on LP.
   # AMS: Etiologies include meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, structural
   lesion (although neg MRI recently), sedation effect, benzo withdrawal.
   Continues to be altered this AM.
   - consider ativan if tachycardic/diaphoretic
   - Cte to allow sedation to wash out
   - Haldol PRN for agitation if necessary
   # Head twitching: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other
   intracranial process on MRI/MRV on [**2165-4-25**]. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head.
   Initial concern for seizures but neuro stated this was unlikely.  Now
   concern for cord issues.
   - f/u Neurosurgery recs: CT myelogram but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 937**] (radiologist
   who performs them) it is not indicated and he should go for MRI.
   - Patient would need open MRI for C-, T-spine which may involve
   transfer to outside facility.
   - Allow MS to clear prior to decision about MRI.
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia, UTI, and CSF showed
   meningitis with neg cx (likely treated).; source thought to be diabetic
   foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and plain film here
   suspicious for osteo. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis. Has been
   febrile with increased WBC but hemodynamically stable; off pressors and
   hypertensive.  Pt spiked, although fever curve not impressive for new
   infectious process.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve.
   - Continue vanc (dosed by level)
   - [**Month (only) 11**] add Zosyn for potential pulm infection if he decompensates.
   - PICC Line in place for long term Abx
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - F/U cultures
   # HTN: Started [**2165-4-27**] during dialysis. Etiologies include pain,
   essential htn, fever related.  Better ctrl with pain ctrl and on
   standing beta blocker.  Cuff systolic pressure 20 points lower that
   A-line and diastolic the same
 a-line d/c
   - Continue home fentanyl patch
   - Continue metoprolol 75mg po qid
   - Continue Hydralizine, but try to wean as pressure tolerates
   - Continue UF as tolerated for volume
   - D/c losartan per renal.
   # Respiratory Failure: now extubated.  ABG showed adequate oxygenation
   post-extubation.
   - Continue Vanc. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - okay to re-intubate per family
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - HD per renal team.
   - will need IR guided tunneled cath -> possibly today.
   # L foot ulcer
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Podiatry and vascular surgery stated they will defer amputation and
   await stabilization/abx treatment of patient prior to surgery.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented with high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), acute respiratory failure (ARF), and acute renal failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including pain control, bacterial meningitis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain. 
2. Bacterial meningitis: The patient has meningitis caused by MSSA. 
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient requires respiratory support due to ARF.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has ARF and is undergoing hemodialysis.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated. 
6. Severe sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, specifically affecting the kidneys and lungs.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a foot ulcer that is infected with MSSA.

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his multiple complications."

   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia with MSSA, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF
   with meningitis on LP.
   # AMS: Etiologies include meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, sedation
   effect, benzo withdrawal. Less likely structural lesion with neg recent
   MRI. Continues to be altered this AM but some improvement as now
   tracking to voice.
   - Consider ativan if tachycardic/diaphoretic
   - Cte to allow sedation to wash out but will uptitrate fentanyl patch
   for pain ctrl
   - Haldol PRN for agitation if necessary
   # Head twitching: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other
   intracranial process on MRI/MRV on [**2165-4-25**]. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head.
   Initial concern for seizures but neuro stated this was unlikely.
   Concern for cord issues but ability to image spine with MRI limited by
   habitus; CT myelogram not indicated per Rads (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 937**]
   - Patient would need open MRI for C-, T-spine which may involve
   transfer to outside facility; attg will rediscuss risks and benefits
   today with neuroradiology and neurosurgery
   - f/u Neurosurgery recs
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia/UTI/osteomyelitis, CSF
   c/w meningitis with neg cx (likely treated), MRSA pneumonia. TEE [**2165-4-25**]
   ruled out endocarditis. Has been febrile with increased WBC but
   hemodynamically stable off pressors and hypertensive but not impressive
   for new infectious process and persistent fevers not unexpected per ID.
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Trend WBC and fever curve; f/u cultures
 repeating sputum cx, CIS
   - Continue vanc (dosed by level); may add Zosyn for potential pulm
   infection if he decompensates; low threshold given new HD line
   placement planned
   - PICC Line in place for long term Abx
   # HTN: Started [**2165-4-27**] during dialysis. Etiologies include pain,
   essential htn, fever related.  Better ctrl with pain ctrl and on
   standing beta blocker.  Cuff systolic pressure 20 points lower that
   A-line and diastolic the same
 a-line d/c
   - Uptitrate fentanyl patch
   - Continue metoprolol 75mg po qid
   - Continue hydralazine, but try to wean as pressure tolerates
   - Continue UF as tolerated for volume
   - D/c losartan per renal
   # Respiratory Failure: Sputum cx grew MRSA. Now extubated. ABG showed
   adequate oxygenation post-extubation.
   - Continue Vanc. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - Repeat sputum cx
   - Okay to re-intubate per family
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - HD per renal team.
   - Plan for IR guided tunneled cath today
   # Anemia: Slowly downtrending
   - Transfuse 1 unit as Hct <21; consider further w/u if does not bump
   appropriately
   - Guaiac stools
   # L foot ulcer
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Podiatry and vascular surgery stated they would defer amputation and
   await stabilization/abx treatment of patient prior to surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the hospital with high-grade bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), a foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture. The patient underwent an intensive medical evaluation and was started on appropriate antibiotic therapy for his infections. He remains in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient's head twitching may indicate seizures, although the neurologist has stated that this is unlikely. Continuous monitoring for seizure activity is necessary, and anti-seizure medications may be considered if seizures persist.
2. Cord issues: The patient has a spinal cord lesion observed on CT scan, but further imaging with an MRI is limited by his habitus. A CT myelogram is not indicated per the radiologist, and the neurosurgery team recommends an open MRI for better evaluation of the cord lesion. Potential complications include paralysis or loss of function if the lesion worsens or is not appropriately managed.
3. MRSA infection: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, osteomyelitis, or septic emboli. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and imaging"

   who performs them) it is not indicated and he should go for MRI.
   - Patient would need open MRI for C-, T-spine which may involve
   transfer to outside facility.
   - Allow MS to clear prior to decision about MRI.
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia, UTI, and CSF showed
   meningitis with neg cx (likely treated).; source thought to be diabetic
   foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and plain film here
   suspicious for osteo. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis. Has been
   febrile with increased WBC but hemodynamically stable; off pressors and
   hypertensive.  Pt spiked, although fever curve not impressive for new
   infectious process.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented to the ICU with high-grade bacteremia, foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), acute renal failure (ARF), and bacterial meningitis. He has a history of multiple myocardial infarctions and drug-eluting stent placement in the right coronary artery. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital and had an initial concern for seizures, but this was later ruled out by a neurologist. He also has impaired skin integrity due to a foot ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Meningitis: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, which is a serious infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It can lead to complications such as brain inflammation, stroke, hearing loss, and neurological problems.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced acute respiratory failure and was intubated but is now extubated. There is a concern for potential worsening of respiratory failure, especially if there is an aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension. This condition requires immediate attention and management, including dialysis to remove waste products and excess fluids from the body.

4. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which may be attributed to pain, essential hypertension, or fever"

   # AMS: Etiologies include meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, structural
   lesion (although neg MRI recently),  sedation effect, benzo withdrawal.
   - consider ativan if tachycardic/diaphoretic
   - Cte to allow sedation to wash out
   - Haldol PRN for agitation if necessary
   # Head twitching: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other
   intracranial process on MRI/MRV on [**2165-4-25**]. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head.
   Initial concern for seizures but neuro stated this was unlikely.  Now
   concern for cord issues.
   - f/u Neurosurgery recs: CT myelogram but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 937**] (radiologist
   who performs them) it is not indicated and he should go for MRI.
   - Patient would need open MRI for C-, T-spine which may involve
   transfer to outside facility.
   - Allow MS to clear prior to decision about MRI.
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia, UTI, and CSF showed
   meningitis with neg cx (likely treated).; source thought to be diabetic
   foot ulcer given OSH report of MSSA wound culture and plain film here
   suspicious for osteo. TEE [**2165-4-25**] ruled out endocarditis. Has been
   febrile with increased WBC but hemodynamically stable; off pressors and
   hypertensive.  Pt spiked, although fever curve not impressive for new
   infectious process.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve.
   - Continue vanc (dosed by level)
   - [**Month (only) 11**] add Zosyn for potential pulm infection if he decompensates.
   - PICC Line in place for long term Abx
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment

   - Continue home fentanyl patch
   - Continue metoprolol 75mg po qid
   - Continue Hydralizine, but try to wean as pressure tolerates
   - Continue UF as tolerated for volume
   - Contiue losartan and up-titrate as needed.
   # Respiratory Failure: now extubated.  ABG showed adequate oxygenation
   post-extubation.
   - Continue Vanc. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - okay to re-intubate per family
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - HD per renal team.
   - will need IR guided tunneled cath -> possibly today.
   # L foot ulcer
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Podiatry and vascular surgery stated they will defer amputation and
   await stabilization/abx treatment of patient prior to surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the ICU for high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture. The patient has been experiencing fever, respiratory failure, hypertension, sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Meningitis: The patient has meningitis caused by MSSA. It is essential to monitor for any neurological deterioration and ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient previously required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress or deterioration is necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing ARF, possibly due to sepsis and hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and continued dialysis as per renal recommendations are crucial.
4. Diabetic Foot Ulcer: The patient has a foot ulcer suspected to be the source of MSSA bacteremia. Monitoring for worsening of the ulcer and ensuring proper wound care and infection control measures are essential.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that may require ongoing management and adjustment of antihypertensive medications.
6. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient is at"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU due to high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture.

The patient's condition has been fluctuating throughout the day. He had a spike in temperature to 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit, but the infectious disease specialist stated that this may be expected and did not want to broaden antibiotic coverage since the patient is hemodynamically stable and his white blood cell (WBC) count is trending down. A sputum culture was ordered.

The patient is scheduled for an intravenous (IV) tunneled hemodialysis (HD) line today. Neurosurgery recommended a CT myelogram or MRI to better define the cord lesion on CT. However, the radiologist thought that a CT myelogram would be low-yield, and the ability to do an MRI is limited by the patient's habitus; therefore, an outside facility with an open MRI would be needed.

The patient remained delirious throughout the night and was hypertensive with systolic blood pressures ranging from 180s to 200s. His arm arterial line (A-line) was discontinued.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics"

   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia with MSSA, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF
   with meningitis on LP.
   # AMS: Etiologies include meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, sedation
   effect, benzo withdrawal. Less likely structural lesion with neg recent
   MRI. Continues to be altered this AM but some improvement as now
   tracking to voice.
   - Consider ativan if tachycardic/diaphoretic
   - Cte to allow sedation to wash out but will uptitrate fentanyl patch
   for pain ctrl
   - Haldol PRN for agitation if necessary
   # Head twitching: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other
   intracranial process on MRI/MRV on [**2165-4-25**]. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head.
   Initial concern for seizures but neuro stated this was unlikely.
   Concern for cord issues but ability to image spine with MRI limited by
   habitus; CT myelogram not indicated per Rads (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 937**]
   - Patient would need open MRI for C-, T-spine which may involve
   transfer to outside facility; attg will rediscuss risks and benefits
   today with neuroradiology and neurosurgery
   - f/u Neurosurgery recs
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia/UTI/osteomyelitis, CSF
   c/w meningitis with neg cx (likely treated), MRSA pneumonia. TEE [**2165-4-25**]
   ruled out endocarditis. Has been febrile with increased WBC but
   hemodynamically stable off pressors and hypertensive but not impressive
   for new infectious process and persistent fevers not unexpected per ID.
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Trend WBC and fever curve; f/u cultures
 repeating sputum cx, CIS
   - Continue vanc (dosed by level); may add Zosyn for potential pulm
   infection if he decompensates; low threshold given new HD line
   placement planned
   - PICC Line in place for long term Abx
   # HTN: Started [**2165-4-27**] during dialysis. Etiologies include pain,
   essential htn, fever related.  Better ctrl with pain ctrl and on
   standing beta blocker.  Cuff systolic pressure 20 points lower that
   A-line and diastolic the same
 a-line d/c
   - Uptitrate fentanyl patch
   - Continue metoprolol 75mg po qid
   - Continue hydralazine, but try to wean as pressure tolerates
   - Continue UF as tolerated for volume
   - D/c losartan per renal
   # Respiratory Failure: Sputum cx grew MRSA. Now extubated. ABG showed
   adequate oxygenation post-extubation.
   - Continue Vanc. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - Repeat sputum cx
   - Okay to re-intubate per family
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - HD per renal team.
   - Plan for IR guided tunneled cath today
   # Anemia: Slowly downtrending
   - Transfuse 1 unit as Hct <21; consider further w/u if does not bump
   appropriately
   - Guaiac stools
   # L foot ulcer
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Podiatry and vascular surgery stated they would defer amputation and
   await stabilization/abx treatment of patient prior to surgery.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and drug-eluting stent placement in the right coronary artery. The patient was transferred from outside hospital for high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute renal failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), blood pressure of 149/60 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support and receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including vancomycin and cefepime. He also received haloperidol for delirium/agitation at midnight.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Renal function tests indicate acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status and confusion. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. On admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable, with high blood pressure and low oxygen saturation. The patient required immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) with a repeat hematocrit of 23.9%. Foley catheter was changed, and urine cultures were resent as it may have been a contaminant. The decision to start cefepime was deferred, and instead, the patient underwent renal ultrasound showing no abscess. Blood and sputum cultures were re-cultured. A hemodialysis (HD) catheter was placed, and the femoral HD line was pulled and cultured. Haldol 1mg X 1 was given for delirium/agitation at midnight.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin at 01:00 PM on [**2165-4-30**], and cefepime at 10:45 AM on [**2165-5-2**].

Infusions include fentanyl at [**2165-5-2**] 08:00 PM, famotidine (Pepcid) at [**2165-5-3**] 12:25 AM, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at [**2165-5-3**] 12:25 AM. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flow sheet data as of [**2165-5-3**] 06:10 AM shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and lab results. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, TCO2, glucose levels, and elevated levels of lactate, LDH, and troponin-T. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired joint mobility, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired reflex integrity, impaired transfers, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), bacterial meningitis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, benign hypertension, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and hyperglycemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia with MSSA, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF
   with meningitis on LP.
   # AMS: Etiologies include meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, sedation
   effect, benzo withdrawal. Less likely structural lesion with neg recent
   MRI. Continues to be altered this AM but some improvement as now
   tracking to voice.
   - Cte to allow sedation to wash out but will uptitrate fentanyl patch
   for pain ctrl; consider ativan if tachycardic/diaphoretic
   - Haldol PRN for agitation if necessary
   # Head twitching: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other
   intracranial process on MRI/MRV on [**2165-4-25**]. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head; low
   likelihood sz per Neuro but given question of T1 lesion of CT spine,
   concern for cord issue. Ability to further evaluate via MRI limited by
   habitus with no indication for CT myelogram per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 937**] (rads).
   - Hold off on MRI (would require OSH transfer) for now while monitoring
   for worsening in mental status
   - f/u Neurosurgery recs
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia/UTI/osteomyelitis, CSF
   c/w meningitis with neg cx (likely treated), MRSA pneumonia. TEE [**2165-4-25**]
   ruled out endocarditis. Cont to have low-grade fever but WBC trending
   down and pt remains hemodynamically stable. Foley changed with negative
   urine cx; no evidence of renal abscess on U/S. Fem HD line also
   replaced with tunneled HD cath yesterday.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve; f/u pending cultures (unclear why sputum
   cx not resent)
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Cont vanc (redoss today); consider cefepime if clinically worsens
   - PICC Line in place for long term Abx
   - F/u ID recs
   # HTN: Started [**2165-4-27**] during dialysis. Etiologies include pain,
   essential htn, fever related.  Better ctrl with pain ctrl and on
   standing beta blocker.  Cuff systolic pressure 20 points lower that
   A-line and diastolic the same
 a-line d/c
   - Uptitrate fentanyl patch
   - Continue metoprolol 75mg po qid
   - Continue hydralazine, but try to wean as pressure tolerates
   - Continue UF as tolerated for volume
   - D/c losartan per renal
   # Anemia: Transfused 2 units for slowly downtrending Hct <21 yesterday
   with 4-pt Hct bump, stable overnight. Of note, pt is getting epo w/ HD.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Repeat PM Hct
   - Consider further w/u if continues to downtrend (add on hemolysis labs
   to yesterday
s pre-transfusion labs, consider RP bleed)
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal for persistent oliguria with IR-guided
   tunneled cath placed yesterday.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - Cont HD per renal team ->seems a bit fluid overloaded today and may
   benefit from some volume depletion via hd today. Will touch base with
   renal team. Goal to take off 2-3L with UF if renal team allows.
   # L foot ulcer
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Podiatry and vascular surgery stated they would defer amputation and
   await stabilization/abx treatment of patient prior to surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and a history of multiple myocardial infarctions and percutaneous coronary interventions. He was transferred from an outside hospital for high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), a foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture. The patient is currently in the ICU with various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AMS: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be due to several factors including meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, sedation effects, and benzodiazepine withdrawal. Monitoring for any changes in mental status and adjusting sedation and analgesia as necessary is important.
2. Foot ulcer: The patient has a foot ulcer with MSSA infection. Close monitoring of the wound and ongoing treatment with antibiotics are required. Additionally, podiatry and vascular surgery are considering deferring amputation until the patient is stabilized and receives appropriate antibiotic treatment.
3. ARF: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to MSSA pneumonia. Mechanical ventilation support may be needed, and careful monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory parameters is essential.
4. Bacteremia/UTI/Osteomyelitis: The patient has high-grade MSSA bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with DM 2, HTN, CAD s/p IMI and DES to RCAx3 transferred
   from OSH for high-grade bacteremia with MSSA, foot ulcer, AMS, and ARF
   with meningitis on LP.
   # AMS: Etiologies include meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, sedation
   effect, benzo withdrawal. Less likely structural lesion with neg recent
   MRI. Continues to be altered this AM but some improvement as now
   tracking to voice.
   - Cte to allow sedation to wash out but will uptitrate fentanyl patch
   for pain ctrl; consider ativan if tachycardic/diaphoretic
   - Haldol PRN for agitation if necessary
   # Head twitching: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other
   intracranial process on MRI/MRV on [**2165-4-25**]. LP c/w bacterial meningitis.
   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head; low
   likelihood sz per Neuro but given question of T1 lesion of CT spine,
   concern for cord issue. Ability to further evaluate via MRI limited by
   habitus with no indication for CT myelogram per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 937**] (rads).
   - Hold off on MRI (would required OSH transfer) for now while
   monitoring for worsening in mental status
   - f/u Neurosurgery recs
   # ID:  Patient with high grade MSSA bacteremia/UTI/osteomyelitis, CSF
   c/w meningitis with neg cx (likely treated), MRSA pneumonia. TEE [**2165-4-25**]
   ruled out endocarditis. Cont to have low-grade fever but WBC trending
   down and pt remains hemodynamically stable. Foley changed with negative
   urine cx; no evidence of renal abscess on U/S. Fem HD line also
   replaced with tunneled HD cath yesterday.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve; f/u pending cultures (unclear why sputum
   cx not resent)
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Cont vanc (redoss todayl); consider cefepime if clinically worsens
   - PICC Line in place for long term Abx
   - F/u ID recs
   # HTN: Started [**2165-4-27**] during dialysis. Etiologies include pain,
   essential htn, fever related.  Better ctrl with pain ctrl and on
   standing beta blocker.  Cuff systolic pressure 20 points lower that
   A-line and diastolic the same
 a-line d/c
   - Uptitrate fentanyl patch
   - Continue metoprolol 75mg po qid
   - Continue hydralazine, but try to wean as pressure tolerates
   - Continue UF as tolerated for volume
   - D/c losartan per renal
   # Respiratory Failure: Sputum cx grew MRSA. Now extubated. ABG showed
   adequate oxygenation post-extubation.
   - Continue Vanc. If worsens, consider broadening abx to cover
   aspiration or HAP
   - Repeat sputum cx ordered but not yet sent
   - F/u AM CXR
   - Okay to re-intubate per family
   # Anemia: Transfused 2 units for slowly downtrending Hct <21 yesterday
   with 4-pt Hct bump, stable overnight. Of note, pt is getting epo w/ HD.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Repeat PM Hct
   - Consider further w/u if continues to downtrend (add on hemolysis labs
   to yesterday
s pre-transfusion labs, consider RP bleed)
   # ARF: Initiated HD per renal for persistent oliguria with IR-guided
   tunneled cath placed yesterday.  Muddy brown casts seen and ATN
   suspected from sepsis and hypotension.
   - F/u Renal recs
   - Cont HD per renal team
   # L foot ulcer
   - ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment
   - Podiatry and vascular surgery stated they would defer amputation and
   await stabilization/abx treatment of patient prior to surgery.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was transferred from another hospital for high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium/Agitation: The patient has been experiencing delirium and agitation, for which Haldol was given. Close monitoring of mental status and continued use of sedation as needed are recommended.

2. Meningitis: The patient has evidence of bacterial meningitis, as indicated by the positive results on the lumbar puncture. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening or complications.

3. Foot Ulcer: The patient has a foot ulcer with osteomyelitis. Close monitoring of the wound and ongoing treatment with antibiotics are necessary. Collaboration with podiatry and vascular surgery is also important to determine the appropriate timing for any potential amputation.

4. ARF: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to MRSA pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial. Repeat sputum cultures should be obtained, and consideration should be given to broadening antibiotic coverage"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and drug-eluting stent placement in the right coronary artery. He was transferred from outside hospital for high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AMS: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various etiologies including meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, sedation effect, and benzodiazepine withdrawal. Monitoring the patient closely and allowing sedation to wear off while uptitrating fentanyl patch for pain control is recommended. Consideration should also be given to using ativan if tachycardic/diaphoretic.

2. Head twitching: The patient is experiencing head twitching, which could indicate a seizure. Further evaluation with an MRI is limited by the patient's habitus. Hold off on MRI for now while monitoring for worsening in mental status and follow-up with neurosurgery recommendations.

3. MSSA bacteremia/UTI/Osteomyelitis: The patient has high-grade MSSA bacteremia/urinary tract infection (UTI)/osteomyelitis. He also has meningitis with negative blood cultures ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note, but there are several significant events mentioned.

Firstly, the patient received lasix for diuresis as per renal recommendations. The diuresis rate was around 100cc/h, and the plan is to redose lasix at 7pm if there is no net negative fluid balance of 1L.

Secondly, the patient was given haldol for agitation.

Thirdly, a yeast culture tip from the femoral site showed contamination, likely due to a femoral line. If the patient's condition decompensates, fluconazole will be administered. Otherwise, the femoral line will be removed and re-cultured.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefepime at 10:45 AM and vancomycin at 2:00 PM.

The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix) for diuresis, and other medications as part of their ICU care.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/65 mmHg to 132/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's height"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for high-grade methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, left foot osteomyelitis, acute renal failure (ARF), altered mental status (AMS) with negative meningitis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, sedation, and pain management. His vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 160/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and troponin levels, as well as low hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient's blood cultures have shown improvement, and there is no evidence of endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). 

The patient's condition remains complicated by AMS, which may be due to meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, sedation effects, or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Head twitching has resolved, and further evaluation of potential intracranial processes is limited due to the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention on the right coronary artery three times. He was transferred from outside hospital for high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure (ARF) with meningitis on lumbar puncture.

The patient is currently in the ICU with the following vital signs: temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 160/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's general appearance is noted as NAD (not applicable or not described), and he has a shovel mask and head twitching. His cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm with soft S1 and S2 heart sounds and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His respiratory examination shows symmetric but diminished breath sounds throughout. The abdominal examination is soft, and the extremities reveal right 1+ edema and left weak peripheral pulses. The skin examination notes a left foot with a bandage, which is likely due to a previous infection or ulcer.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as"

   New head twitching yesterday with no evidence of change on CT head; low
   likelihood sz per Neuro but given question of T1 lesion of CT spine,
   concern for cord issue. Ability to further evaluate via MRI limited by
   habitus with no indication for CT myelogram per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 937**] (rads).

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for high-grade bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), foot ulcer, altered mental status (AMS), and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He had meningitis confirmed on lumbar puncture (LP). The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing concerns including agitation, potential seizures, and fluid overload. He is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, pain control medications, and antipsychotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient has exhibited head twitching, which could indicate a seizure. Further evaluation is needed, and anticonvulsant therapy may be required.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing AMS, which could be due to various etiologies such as meningitis, ICU delirium, hypoxia, sedation effect, benzodiazepine withdrawal, or structural lesions. Monitoring for worsening mental status is essential.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient is showing signs of fluid overload, as indicated by the administration of lasix and ongoing monitoring of fluid balance.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with muddy brown casts seen on urinalysis, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis and hypotension."
