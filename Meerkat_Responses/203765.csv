","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension. She presented with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction), which was likely caused by an embolic rather than thrombotic event. She underwent angioplasty of the occluded LAD lesion and also has disease in the RCA and LCx. She has risk factors including hypertension and hyperlipidemia with LDL levels above 100 on pravastatin 20. She experienced muscle aches with atorvastatin and simvastatin.

The patient is currently asymptomatic with no chest pain or shortness of breath. She is being diuresed with good effect. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 113/37-141/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 738 mL and output of 1,550 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 812 mL.

Physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished and overweight, with diminished pulses in both lower extremities. She has tachypnea, symmetric chest expansion, and clear breath sounds except for crackles in the posterior lung fields. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and she has no"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension who presented with a STEMI. The patient's amiodarone was stopped due to no effect on her atrial fibrillation (afib). She received 5 mg IV metoprolol and her oral metoprolol dose was increased to 25 mg po tid. Her potassium levels were repleted and she converted back into normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with the metoprolol. The patient has occluded left anterior descending (LAD) lesion which was angioplastied, along with right coronary artery (RCA) and circumflex artery (LCx) disease. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Reinfarction: The patient has ongoing ischemia and may be at risk for another heart attack if there are any further blockages in the coronary arteries.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient is currently in afib with a rapid ventricular response. If not managed appropriately, she may develop other arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

3. Heart failure: The patient is volume overloaded and has elevated wedge pressure, indicating possible heart failure. If not properly managed, this could lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and decreased cardiac output.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension, presenting with a STEMI. She was found to have occluded LAD lesion which was angioplastied. She also has RCA and LCx disease. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and potential coronary artery disease. She has been given various medications including aspirin, Plavix, pravastatin, Integrillin, captopril, and beta-blockers. She is also on diuretics and has been advised to follow a cardiac diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. If not managed properly, it can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has already experienced a STEMI, indicating a blockage in one of her coronary arteries. If the other arteries are also compromised, it can result in further myocardial damage and potentially lead to heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has evidence of disease in the RCA and LCx arteries, indicating a higher risk of future cardiovascular events if not managed appropriately.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side (121/52 mmHg), which may increase the risk of hypotension and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension who presented with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was initially unresponsive to amiodarone but converted back to sinus rhythm after administration of metoprolol. The patient underwent coronary catheterization, which revealed occluded left anterior descending (LAD) lesion that was angioplastied, as well as right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery (LCx) disease.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), pravastatin, and captopril. She is also receiving integrilin infusion and Lasix for fluid overload. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's CK levels, as they have not yet reached peak, and to start beta-blocker therapy at a low dose.

Regarding the rhythm, the patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 70-90 beats per minute. Amiodarone has been discontinued due to its lack of effect on the patient's atrial fibrillation. If the patient continues to be in atrial fibrillation tomorrow, cardioversion with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) will be considered. Heparin has been held off as the patient is likely to convert, and consideration will be given to oral cou"

","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension, presenting with a STEMI. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's amiodarone was stopped due to ineffective control of her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was given 5 mg IV metoprolol once and her oral metoprolol was increased to 25 mg po tid. Her potassium levels were repleted, after which she converted back into normal sinus rhythm.

The patient denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or lightheadedness. She was able to walk out of bed to the commode without any assistance.

The patient has allergies to lisinopril, dizziness, and vertigo. She is currently receiving infusions of furosemide and metoprolol, as well as prophylactic heparin sodium. Her other medications include captopril and beta-blockers.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the aforementioned changes. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/52 to 140/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is in sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished and overweight-obese appearance. Eyes"
