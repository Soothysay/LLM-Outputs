   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with presumed nonconvulsive status and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 have shown persistent epileptiform activity
   from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for
   continuous EEG monitoring - unclear timing of EEG with regard to
   convulsive episodes.  Unclear etiology.  Her prior CVA are likely
   resposible.  There were electrolyte abnormalities on admission,
   however, the patient persisted with seizures after correction.  She had
   no history of head trauma and CT head x 2 showed multiple old ischemic
   changes but no new process.  Patient has history of cancer and may have
   metastasis - MRI was not performed.  Infectious evaluation as below -
   no lumbar puncture performed.  Home medications not known to contribute
   to seizure activity.  No report of toxicology screen on admission to
   OSH.
   - Neurology consult; appreciate
   - Unable to obtain continuous EEG overnight but will start in the
   morning
   - Continue phenytoin, and phenobarbital; check levels for goal dilantin
   15-20 corrected for albumin
   - Will give vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir
   overnight for potential meningitis pending lumbar puncture
   - Lumbar puncture - attempted but unsuccessful and will need to perform
   with Neurology in the morning
   - Check chest x-ray, repeat urine and blood cultures
   - MRI/A head
   - TTE with bubble study to exclude clot
   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Unclear etiology - seizures versus infection.
   BAL from admission grew only yeast.  Urine and blood cultures
   negative.  RIJ in place since [**12-2**] without erythema or discharge.
   Patient initially on diflucan, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for
   aspiration, but changed to zosyn and linezolid at some point prior to
   transfer.  Patient has not received an LP.
   - Will give vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir
   overnight for potential meningitis pending lumbar puncture
   - Lumbar puncture
   - Chest x-ray
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures
   - Consider changing RIJ tomorrow
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of aspiration.  Was treated for aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone
   and clindamycin for an unknown course.  Chest x-ray on admission here
   with question retrocardiac opacity.  No other known pulmonary disease.
   Good gag with suction.
   - Sputum culture
   - Repeat chest x-ray
   - Change to pressure support overnight
   - Consider extubation if EEG negative for nonconvulsive status and no
   pulmonary infection
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Hematocrit trending down at OSH from 37 to 32.
   Guaiac negative on admission.  No signs or symptoms of active
   bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Monitor
   # Atrial flutter: Rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem.  Has not
   been anticoagulated recently - CHADS 2 score 0-2 (unclear etiology of
   CVA).
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - Continue to hold systemic anticoagulation
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s).
   - Check TSH, free T4
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.  No acute
   issues.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures, and currently experiencing nonconvulsive status and fevers. The patient has been transferred from another hospital and is being treated in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Seizures: The patient has persistent epileptiform activity on EEG, likely caused by prior CVAs. There is no known history of head trauma, and CT scans have shown multiple old ischemic changes but no new processes. The patient's history of cancer may also contribute to seizure activity.

2. Fevers and leukocytosis: The etiology is unclear, possibly due to seizures or an infection. Blood and urine cultures have been negative, but a yeast infection was detected in the BAL from admission.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to aspiration. She has been treated for aspiration pneumonia but has a retrocardiac opacity on the chest x-ray. No other known pulmonary disease is present.

4. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia with a declining hematocrit level. There are no signs or symptoms of active bleeding.

5. Atrial flutter: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter, which is being rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem. The patient has not been antico"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with presumed nonconvulsive status and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 have shown persistent epileptiform activity
   from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for
   continuous EEG monitoring - unclear timing of EEG with regard to
   convulsive episodes.  Unclear etiology.  Her prior CVA are likely
   resposible.  There were electrolyte abnormalities on admission,
   however, the patient persisted with seizures after correction.  She had
   no history of head trauma and CT head x 2 showed multiple old ischemic
   changes but no new process.  Patient has history of cancer and may have
   metastasis - MRI was not performed.  Infectious evaluation as below -
   no lumbar puncture performed.  Home medications not known to contribute
   to seizure activity.  No report of toxicology screen on admission to
   OSH.
   - Neurology consult; appreciate
   - Unable to obtain continuous EEG overnight but will start in the
   morning
   - Continue phenytoin, and phenobarbital; check levels for goal dilantin
   15-20 corrected for albumin
   - Will give vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir
   overnight for potential meningitis pending lumbar puncture
   - Lumbar puncture - attempted but unsuccessful and will need to perform
   with Neurology in the morning
   - Check chest x-ray, repeat urine and blood cultures
   - MRI/A head
   - TTE with bubble study to exclude clot
   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Unclear etiology - seizures versus infection.
   BAL from admission grew only yeast.  Urine and blood cultures
   negative.  RIJ in place since [**12-2**] without erythema or discharge.
   Patient initially on diflucan, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for
   aspiration, but changed to zosyn and linezolid at some point prior to
   transfer.  Patient has not received an LP.
   - Will give vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir
   overnight for potential meningitis pending lumbar puncture
   - Lumbar puncture
   - Chest x-ray
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures
   - Consider changing RIJ tomorrow
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of aspiration.  Was treated for aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone
   and clindamycin for an unknown course.  Chest x-ray on admission here
   with question retrocardiac opacity.  No other known pulmonary disease.
   Good gag with suction.
   - Sputum culture
   - Repeat chest x-ray
   - Change to pressure support overnight
   - Consider extubation if EEG negative for nonconvulsive status and no
   pulmonary infection
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Hematocrit trending down at OSH from 37 to 32.
   Guaiac negative on admission.  No signs or symptoms of active
   bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Monitor
   # Atrial flutter: Rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem.  Has not
   been anticoagulated recently - CHADS 2 score 0-2 (unclear etiology of
   CVA).
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - Continue to hold systemic anticoagulation
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s).
   - Check TSH, free T4
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.  No acute
   issues.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 have shown persistent epileptiform activity
   from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for
   continuous EEG monitoring
 unclear timing of EEG with regard to
   convulsive episodes.  Unclear etiology.  Her prior CVA are likely
   responsible.  There were electrolyte abnormalities on admission,
   however, the patient persisted with seizures after correction.  She had
   no history of head trauma and CT head x 2 showed multiple old ischemic
   changes but no new process.  Patient has history of cancer and may have
   metastasis
 MRI was not performed at OSH.  Infectious evaluation as
   below
 LP not performed at OSH, LP negative on admission here,
   although has been on antibiotics.  Home medications not known to
   contribute to seizure activity.  No report of toxicology screen on
   admission to OSH.
   - Neurology consult; appreciate
   - Continuous EEG initiated this morning
   - Continue phenytoin, and phenobarbital; discuss dosing with Neurology
   for goal corrected phenytoin 15-20
   - Will give vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir pending
   MRI
   - MRI/A head
   - TTE with bubble study to exclude clot
   - Restart heparin drip pending results of MRI
   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Unclear etiology - seizures versus infection.
   OSH BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and blood cultures
   negative.  RIJ in place since [**12-2**] without erythema or discharge.
   Patient initially on diflucan, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for
   aspiration, but changed to zosyn and linezolid at some point prior to
   transfer.  Patient has not received an LP.
   - Will give vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir
   overnight for potential meningitis pending lumbar puncture
   - Lumbar puncture [**12-8**] negative
   - Chest x-ray negative
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures - NGTD
   - Change OSH RIJ
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of aspiration.  Was treated for aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone
   and clindamycin for an unknown course.  Chest x-ray on admission here
   with question retrocardiac opacity but excellent gas exchange and
   negative sputum.  No other known pulmonary disease.  Good gag with
   suction.
   - Change to pressure support
   - Sputum
 gram stain negative, culture pending
   - Consider extubation if EEG negative for nonconvulsive status and
   doing well on pressure support
   # Atrial flutter: Rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem.  Has been
   off recent anticoagulation.
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - Restart heparin gtt pending MRI
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Hematocrit trending down at OSH from 37 to 32.
   Guaiac negative on admission.  No signs or symptoms of active
   bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Monitor
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s).
   - Check TSH, free T4
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.  No acute
   issues.

The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of multiple cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) and squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil, who presented to the hospital after being found unresponsive at home. She was seizing upon arrival and underwent fiber optic intubation. Her head CT was negative, and she had leukocytosis with a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. EEGs showed persistent epileptiform activity, and she was transferred to the ICU.

She has been on continuous EEG monitoring and is awaiting an MRI. The patient is currently on prophylactic systemic anticoagulation with heparin and has been empirically treated for possible meningitis with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin. Her blood cultures were taken at OSH, and she is being pan-cultured for fever. Dilantin was loaded, and she is being monitored closely.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/69 to 156/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old woman with PMH of CVA, Sq Cell [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with
   fever and seizure. LP negative but after several days of antibiotics.
   Persistent seizure activity at OSH , concern for non-convulsive status.
   Now on continous EEG monitoring. Awaiting MRI. Dilantin loaded. Will
   continue empiric regimen of vanc/ceftriaxone/ampicillin but suspect
   CVA, possibly from cardioembolic source. Will restart systemic
   anticoagulation today. Will obtain TTE with bubble study. Pan-cultured
   for fever at OSH. Will change RIJ today. Possible retro-cardiac
   opacitiy on CXR but  excellent gas exchange. Will change to PS today,
   but will need to settle neuro issues before making decisions about
   weaning sedation. Further plans as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil, who presented to the hospital after being found unresponsive at home. She was seizing upon arrival and underwent fiberoptic intubation. Head CT was negative, and she was febrile with leukocytosis. EEGs showed persistent epileptiform activity, and she was transferred to the ICU. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated platelets. She is currently on continuous EEG monitoring, awaiting an MRI, and being treated with antibiotics for suspected meningitis. The patient also has a history of cancer treatment and is on systemic anticoagulation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-convulsive status epilepticus due to persistent seizure activity.
2. Possible cardioembolic stroke secondary to her history of CVAs and cancer.
3. Infection (fever and leukocytosis), possibly meningitis (negative LP).
4. Complications related to anticoagulation therapy (e.g., bleeding).
5. Respiratory complications due to mechanical ventilation.
6. Potential need for neurosurgical intervention if an intracranial process is identified on further imaging.
7. Malnutrition due to tube feeds currently on hold.
8. Potential glycemic control issues with regular insulin sliding scale."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a medical history of multiple cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) and squamous cell carcinoma of the neck. She was transferred from the operating room (OSH) with a seizure and possible status epilepticus. An electroencephalogram (EEG) yesterday did not show evidence of ongoing seizure activity. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is pending to rule out a new CVA as the cause of the seizure.

The patient's allergies include Erbitux (Intraven) and encephalopathy. She received antibiotics such as vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and ampicillin. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and other medications in the ICU.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the seizure. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/68 mmHg to 150/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has atrial flutter and is on mechanical ventilation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,924 mL, including 874 mL of intravenous fluids, and output of 2,207 mL, including 1,215 mL of urine. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator"

   68 year old woman with PMH as above transfered from OSH with seizure.
   No evidence of status, MRI read pending to r/o new CVA. Anticoagulated
   on heparin
   for afib, on asa and allowing BP to autoregulate for now. Fever in
   association with her seizure at the OSH, LP negative here but obtained
   after > 72 hours of abx
   so completing empiric course of vanc/ceftriaxone and acyclovir. Will DC
   acyclovir if MRI negative for encephalitis. Continue dilantin. DC
   phenobarb and propofol today
   . Small RLL GGO on CXR but good gas exchange and could extubate if more
   awake. Further plans as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and squamous cell carcinoma of the neck. She was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and possible status epilepticus. An EEG yesterday showed no evidence of ongoing seizure activity. An MRI is pending to rule out a new CVA as the cause of the seizure. The patient has been receiving anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, as well as antibiotics and antiviral medication empirically.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA): Given the patient's history of multiple CVAs and the current symptoms of seizure, there is a risk of another CVA occurring.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and recent use of antibiotics suggest a possible infection. This could be related to a central nervous system infection, such as encephalitis, or another source of infection.
3. Status epilepticus: Although the EEG did not show ongoing seizure activity, there is still a possibility of developing status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency.
4. Anticoagulation-related bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin for atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure if the ventilator settings are not optimized or if there are complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with seizures and fevers. She has been diagnosed with persistent epileptiform activity in the left cerebral hemisphere, unclear timing of EEG with regard to convulsive episodes, and unclear etiology. The patient also has a history of cancer and may have metastasis. She has undergone multiple tests, including a transesophageal echocardiogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture, all of which have shown negative results. The patient is currently receiving medications for seizure control, infection prevention, and other medical conditions. She is intubated for airway protection and is on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she has shown some abnormalities in her lab results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure control: The patient's seizures are persistent, and there is still an unclear etiology. Continuous EEG monitoring and further evaluation by neurology are recommended.
2. Infection: The patient has fevers and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending. She also has a history of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration. Weaning off sedation and discussing with neurology regarding phenobarbital discontinuation"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures.
- She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers.
- She has persistent epileptiform activity from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, unclear timing of EEG with regard to convulsive episodes, and unclear etiology.
- The patient had electrolyte abnormalities on admission, but persisted with seizures after correction.
- She has a history of cancer and may have metastasis.
- MRI was not performed at the previous hospital. Infectious evaluation is ongoing.
- She is currently on phenytoin for seizure control and antibiotics for potential infection.
- She is also being treated for respiratory failure, atrial flutter, anemia, and hyperthyroidism.
- The patient's cancer status post chemoradiation is stable.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has persistent epileptiform activity and a history of seizures. It is crucial to monitor her closely for any signs of recurrent seizures.
2. Infection: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis indicate a possible infection. The ongoing infectious evaluation and negative cultures suggest the need for further investigation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers.

The patient has been diagnosed with the following medical complications:

1. Seizures: The patient has had persistent epileptiform activity on EEG, which suggests ongoing seizure activity. The etiology is unclear, but her prior CVAs are likely responsible. Electrolyte abnormalities were present, but the seizures persisted even after correction. An MRI was not performed at the receiving hospital, and there were no signs of head trauma or new processes on the CT head.

2. Fevers and leukocytosis: The patient had fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, but the etiology is unclear. Seizures versus infection as the cause is uncertain. Cultures from various sites (BAL, urine, blood) were negative, except for yeast in the BAL. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and others.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection due to aspiration. She was treated for aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone and clindamycin, but the duration of treatment is unknown. A chest x-ray showed a right lung effusion, and sputum"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of seizures. They have a history of encephalopathy, allergies to Erbitux (Intraven) (Cetuximab), and previous strokes. The patient is currently on multiple medications including insulin sliding scale, propofol, and heparin sodium. They are also receiving prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 136/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a respiratory support system. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient initially presented with seizures, and there is a possibility of further seizure activity due to the underlying encephalopathy or new left frontal cortical stroke.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever, which needs to be investigated for possible infection. The source of the fever should be identified, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered if an infection is confirmed.
3. Stroke progression: The new left frontal cortical stroke identified on MRI needs close monitoring for any signs of progression or neurological deterioration.
4. Medication side effects: The patient is on multiple medications including propofol and insulin sliding scale."

","The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). She presented to the hospital with a seizure and was intubated for airway protection. The patient was transferred to another hospital for continuous EEG monitoring. The EEG at the other hospital was negative for seizure activity, and an MRI revealed a possible new infarct corresponding to the seizure focus seen on the EEG at the initial hospital.

The patient is currently being weaned off sedation in order to extubate. Her allergies include Erbitux (Cetuximab). She has been on various antibiotics, including acyclovir, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin. The patient is receiving continuous heparin infusion and propofol sedation.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/58 mmHg to 169/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter, and she has diminished breath sounds on the right base.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and multiple cerebrovascular accidents (strokes) who presented to the hospital with a seizure. She was intubated for airway protection and transferred to another hospital for continuous EEG monitoring. The EEG at the other hospital was negative for seizure activity, and an MRI showed a possible new infarct corresponding to the seizure focus seen on the EEG at the initial hospital.

The patient is currently being weaned off sedation in preparation for extubation. She has been started on RISS (likely referring to a medication regimen), and her phenobarbital has been discontinued. The patient has a history of allergies to Erbitux (Cetuximab) and encephalopathy. Her last doses of antibiotics were acyclovir on 12/9, ceftriaxone on 12/10, and ampicillin on 12/10. She is currently receiving heparin sodium and propofol infusions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. She has been diagnosed with atrial flutter, respiratory failure, seizure without status epilepticus, hypothyroidism, anemia, hyperthyroidism, and squamous cell tonsillar cancer. She is currently intubated for airway protection due to aspiration and being treated for aspiration pneumonia. Her medical team is considering a lumbar puncture to evaluate for possible infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics for an extended period, indicating a concern for infection. The medical team is considering a lumbar puncture to rule out central nervous system infection. Additionally, the patient has shown leukocytosis and fevers of unknown origin, which could be signs of an ongoing infection.
2. Seizure: The patient has experienced seizures, and persistent epileptiform activity has been seen on EEG. She has been started on phenytoin to control the seizures.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for possible aspiration pneumonia, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause of her respiratory failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to aspiration and is on mechanical ventilation. She has persistent epileptiform activity on EEG but unclear timing of convulsive episodes. The etiology of her seizures is unclear, with possible causes including prior CVA or a new lesion on MRI. She has been on antibiotics for suspected central nervous system (CNS) infection but continues to have fevers. Her LP was negative, and she is still being covered empirically for CNS infection. The patient is also on heparin for prophylaxis due to a high ongoing stroke risk.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to being on mechanical ventilation. Increasing secretions raise suspicion for new VAP.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, which needs to be monitored and managed with rate control medications.
3. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia with a gradually trending down hematocrit. It is important to monitor her hemoglobin levels and consider transfusion if the hematocrit falls below 21 or if there are signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
4. Hyperthyroidism: The patient has"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures, who was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including: 
1. Seizures: The patient has persistent epileptiform activity in the left cerebral hemisphere without continuous EEG monitoring. The etiology of seizures is unclear, and there is a new lesion on MRI that could account for this. 
2. Fevers and leukocytosis: The cause of these symptoms is unclear, as both seizures and infection are possible explanations. Initial cultures were negative, but the patient has been on antibiotics. 
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to aspiration. She has been treated for aspiration pneumonia but has no known pulmonary disease.

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Seizures: The patient has persistent epileptiform activity on EEG from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere. The timing of the EEG with regard to convulsive episodes is unclear, and the etiology of the seizures is also unclear. The patient's prior CVA may be responsible for the seizures. There were electrolyte abnormalities on admission, but the patient persisted with seizures after correction. There is no history of head trauma, and CT head x 2 showed multiple old ischemic changes but no new process. The patient has a history of cancer and may have metastasis. An MRI was not performed at the previous hospital. Infectious evaluation is ongoing.

2. Fevers and leukocytosis: The etiology of the fevers and leukocytosis is unclear - whether it is due to seizures or an infection. The patient's BAL from admission grew only yeast, and urine and blood cultures are negative. The patient initially received antifungal treatment, but this was later changed. The patient has not received a lumbar puncture yet.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to aspiration. She was treated for aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone and"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and persistent epileptiform activity from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere. The etiology of the seizures is unclear, and the patient has experienced convulsive episodes despite correction of electrolyte abnormalities.

2. Infection: The patient has fevers and leukocytosis with an unclear etiology. Previous cultures have been negative, but the patient has received empiric antibiotic therapy. There is also a concern for aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's intubation for airway protection.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. This may be related to aspiration pneumonia or underlying lung disease.

4. Atrial flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, which is being rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem. The patient was recently off anticoagulation, so there is a risk of thromboembolic events.

5. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia with a declining hematocrit. There are no signs or symptoms of active bleeding, but further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

6. Hyperthyroidism: The patient has abnormal thyroid function tests, with a low TSH and elevated free T4. The etiology of hyperthyroidism is unclear, and it needs to be managed appropriately.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke), tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to seizures and fevers. The patient has persistent epileptiform activity on EEG and new left abnormality on MRI, indicating a possible seizure focus in the left cerebral hemisphere. She had electrolyte abnormalities but continued to experience seizures after correction. There is no history of head trauma, and CT scans showed multiple old ischemic changes but no new processes.

Infectious evaluation revealed a negative lumbar puncture (LP) on admission, although she was on antibiotics. Home medications were not known to contribute to seizure activity, and no toxicology screen was reported on admission. An echocardiogram showed no clot, and EEG showed no seizure activity, so phenobarbital was discontinued. Acyclovir was stopped because MRI showed no encephalitis.

The patient has been on heparin for prophylaxis of further emboli. Empiric antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin) were started for 14 days due to fevers and leukocytosis, with unclear etiology between seizures versus infection. Blood cultures were negative, and BAL grew only yeast. The patient initially received fluconazole, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia, then changed to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with a medical history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) who presented with a new seizure in the setting of a left-sided CVA. She has been experiencing respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159/86 mmHg to 167/86 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. She is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has received various antibiotics, including acyclovir, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin, as part of the empiric regimen for suspected meningitis. However, her lumbar puncture results were negative. The patient is also receiving propofol infusion and heparin sodium.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), with slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hb) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and coagulation profile, are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray revealed right-sided infiltrate"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I would emphasize
   and add the following points:
   68 year old woman with PMH CVA presents with seizure in the setting of
   new CVA. Hx of afib s/p ablation and pacer, CT shows multiple prior
   CVAs. Now with persistent respiratory failure [**1-21**] probable VAp
   (hypoxemia, increased secretions, right sided infiltrate on CXR). On
   vanc/ceftriaxone/amp as part of empiric 14d regimen for meningitis (LP
   negative but after long period of abx). Will obtain mini-BAL now and
   add cipro today.
   Due to copious thick secretions and RSBI 206, she is not yet ready for
   extubation. On dilantin and following level. Further plans as per
   resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with a medical history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) who presented with a new seizure in the setting of a left-sided CVA. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAp). The patient is on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin as part of an empiric 14-day regimen for meningitis, with a negative lumbar puncture but after a long period of antibiotic treatment. Mini-BAL will be obtained to add ciprofloxacin today.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 159/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is unresponsive and sedated, with trace edema in both lower extremities. Her lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 666 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 99,000/mm3. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.35.

   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring
 unclear timing of EEG with regard to convulsive
   episodes.  Unclear etiology.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however
   there is also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which
   could account for this. There were electrolyte abnormalities on
   admission, however, the patient persisted with seizures after
   correction.  No evidence of brain metastases. Infectious evaluation as
   below
 LP not performed at OSH, LP negative on admission here,
   although had been on antibiotics; continuing to cover CNS infection
   empirically.  Home medications not known to contribute to seizure
   activity.  No report of toxicology screen on admission to OSH. No clot
   by ECHO. EEG showed no seizure, discontinued phenobarbitol. MRI showed
   no encephalitis: acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated
   - Continue phenytoin
   - On heparin for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk.
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin for empiric course *14 days
   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Unclear etiology - seizures versus infection.
   OSH BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and blood cultures
   negative.  RIJ in place since [**12-2**] without erythema or discharge.
   Patient initially on diflucan, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for
   aspiration, but changed to zosyn and linezolid at some point prior to
   transfer.  Patient
s LP was unrevealing but done in setting of
   antibiotics. Changed OSH RIJ.
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin * 14 days
   - Lumbar puncture [**12-8**] negative
   - Chest x-ray effusion in right lung, f/u sputum; mini-BAL today
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures - NGTD
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of aspiration.  Increasing secretions now raise suspicion for new
   vent-associated pneumonia. Adding ciprofloxacin to vanc/ceftriaxone/amp
   for double coverage of possible resistant gram negatives.
   # Atrial flutter: Rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem.  Has been
   off recent anticoagulation.
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Hematocrit trending down gradually.  Guaiac
   negative on admission.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Monitor
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s). TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient has been experiencing encephalopathy, fevers, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, atrial flutter, anemia, and hyperthyroidism.

The patient has been on multiple medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin), antiepileptic drugs (Phenytoin), anticoagulants (Heparin), and others. She is also receiving nutrition and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fevers, leukocytosis, and previous use of antibiotics indicate a possible ongoing infection. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source and cause of the infection.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increasing secretions and suspicion of new VAP raise concerns about ventilator-associated complications. Additional measures such as bronchoscopy and culture sampling should be considered.

3. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter needs close monitoring, and rate control measures should be continued. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary due to the patient's high CHADS score.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases. Infectious
   evaluation as below
 LP not performed at OSH, LP negative on admission
   here, although had been on antibiotics; continuing to cover CNS
   infection empirically.  Home medications not known to contribute to
   seizure activity.  No report of toxicology screen on admission to OSH.
   No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative:
   acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated; will need carotid dopplers to complete
   w/u given h/o multiple strokes
   - Continue phenytoin; will reload today for level not at goal
   - On heparin for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin for empiric course *14 days  (day
   1 is [**12-8**])
   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Still with low grade temps to as high as
   100.6.  WBC count up to 11.7 (previously nml) with 81% neutrophils, no
   bands.  Etiology not entirely clear, but pulmonary possible source
   given increased secretions over past few days (currently improved). OSH
   BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and blood cultures from OSH
   were negative.  RIJ d/c
d on [**12-8**] and LIJ placed on [**12-8**] without
   erythema or discharge.  Patient
s LP was unrevealing but done in
   setting of antibiotics.
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin * 14 days (day 1 is [**12-8**])
   - f/u sputum; mini-BAL today
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures - NGTD
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of seizure, altered mental status, aspiration.  Increasing secretions
   raise suspicion for new vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR with
   retrocardiac opacity, but this may represent atelectasis as opposed to
   infiltrate.  Ciprofloxacin added [**12-11**] to vanc/ceftriaxone/amp for
   double coverage of possible resistant gram negatives.
   - goal to wean propofol
   # Atrial flutter:  Had been well rate-controlled with digoxin and
   diltiazem, however with episode of RVR overnight responsive to IV
   metoprolol; now rate improved.  Has been off anticoagulation as an
   outpatient (unclear why not on coumadin given a.fib/flutter and
   multiple CVAs).
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   # Anemia: Normocytic however with elevated RDW.  Unclear hct baseline
   although hct has remained stable in the high 20s range.   Guaiac
   negative on admission.   No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Monitor
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s). TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.  No acute
   issues.
   - Monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers.
- The patient has been diagnosed with persistent epileptiform activity in the left cerebral hemisphere, possibly due to prior CVA or a new lesion seen on MRI. No evidence of brain metastases.
- Infectious evaluation shows negative LP and HSV PCR, so acyclovir was stopped. Empirical coverage for CNS infection is being continued.
- The patient has low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis with an elevated WBC count of 11.7. The etiology of the fever is unclear, but a possible pulmonary source is suspected. BAL from admission grew yeast, while urine and blood cultures from OSH were negative.
- The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to seizure, altered mental status, and aspiration. There is suspicion for new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with increasing secretions and a retrocardiac opacity on CXR.
- The patient also has atrial flutter, which has been well rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem. She has been off anticoagulation as an outpatient, despite having a high CHADS score including past strokes.
- Other medical issues include anemia, hyperthyroidism, and squamous cell tonsillar cancer status"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) admitted to the ICU with a seizure and new CVA. The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and has had respiratory failure with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has also been diagnosed with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and has a poor respiratory system baseline (RSBI). The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is already compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, especially if the RSBI remains poor or if there is no improvement in the VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization and anticoagulation therapy. Regular assessment and prophylaxis are necessary to prevent this complication.

3. Nosocomial infections: Given the patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures, she is at risk of developing nosocomial infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).

4. Stroke recurrence: The patient has a history of multiple CVAs and is currently experiencing another episode. There is a risk of recurrent strokes,"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases. Infectious
   evaluation as below
 LP not performed at OSH, LP negative on admission
   here, although had been on antibiotics; continuing to cover CNS
   infection empirically.  Home medications not known to contribute to
   seizure activity.  No report of toxicology screen on admission to OSH.
   No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative:
   acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated
   - Continue phenytoin; will reload today for level not at goal
   - On heparin for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin for empiric course *14 days  (day
   1 is [**12-8**])
   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Still with low grade temps to as high as
   100.6.  WBC count up to 11.7 (previously nml) with 81% neutrophils, no
   bands.  Etiology not entirely clear, but pulmonary possible source
   given increased secretions over past few days (currently improved). OSH
   BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and blood cultures from OSH
   were negative.  RIJ d/c
d on [**12-8**] and LIJ placed on [**12-8**] without
   erythema or discharge.  Patient
s LP was unrevealing but done in
   setting of antibiotics.
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin * 14 days (day 1 is [**12-8**])
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures - NGTD
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of seizure, altered mental status, aspiration.  Increasing secretions
   raise suspicion for new vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR with
   retrocardiac opacity, but this may represent atelectasis as opposed to
   infiltrate.  Ciprofloxacin added [**12-11**] to vanc/ceftriaxone/amp for
   double coverage of possible resistant gram negatives.
   - goal to extubate today
   # Atrial flutter:  Had been well rate-controlled with digoxin and
   diltiazem, however with episode of RVR overnight responsive to IV
   metoprolol; now rate improved.  Has been off anticoagulation as an
   outpatient (unclear why not on coumadin given a.fib/flutter and
   multiple CVAs).
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   # Anemia: Normocytic however with elevated RDW.  Unclear hct baseline
   although hct has remained stable in the high 20s range.   Guaiac
   negative on admission.   No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - check pm HCT todat as 3 pt hct drop o/n
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s). TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.  No acute
   issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient's current conditions include:
1. Seizures: Persistent epileptiform activity in the left cerebral hemisphere, unclear etiology.
2. Fevers and leukocytosis: Low-grade temperatures and increased white blood cell count, possibly due to a pulmonary source.
3. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection, suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Atrial flutter: Well-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem, but required IV metoprolol for rate control.
5. Anemia: Normocytic with elevated RDW, unclear baseline Hct, stable in the high 20s range.
6. Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology, possibly Grave's disease or functioning nodule(s).
7. Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation, no acute issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increasing secretions raise suspicion for new VAP. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and implementation of VAP prevention strategies are crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's high CHADS score including past strokes puts her at high risk for"

   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases. Infectious
   evaluation as below
 LP not performed at OSH, LP negative on admission
   here, although had been on antibiotics; continuing to cover CNS
   infection empirically.  Home medications not known to contribute to
   seizure activity.  No report of toxicology screen on admission to OSH.
   No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative:
   acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated; will need carotid dopplers to complete
   w/u given h/o multiple strokes

   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Still with low grade temps to as high as
   100.6.  WBC count up to 11.7 (previously nml) with 81% neutrophils, no
   bands.  Etiology not entirely clear, but pulmonary possible source
   given increased secretions over past few days (currently improved). OSH
   BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and blood cultures from OSH
   were negative.  RIJ d/c

   of seizure, altered mental status, aspiration.  Increasing secretions
   raise suspicion for new vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR with
   retrocardiac opacity, but this may represent atelectasis as opposed to

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient's EEG showed persistent epileptiform activity in the left cerebral hemisphere, but continuous EEG performed here did not show any epileptiform focus. She is still experiencing low-grade temperatures, with a maximum of 100.5°F. Her WBC count is elevated at 11.7, and she has 81% neutrophils. She has been on antibiotics for CNS infection and is being covered empirically. Her MRI showed no encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative, so acyclovir was stopped.

The patient is intubated for airway protection due to seizure, altered mental status, and aspiration. Increasing secretions raise suspicion for new ventilator-associated pneumonia. She has a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, which may represent atelectasis or infiltrate. Ciprofloxacin was added to her antibiotic regimen for double coverage of possible resistant gram negatives.

The patient has atrial flutter, which has been well-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem. However, she had an episode of rapid ventricular response overnight, which responded to IV metoprolol. She has been off anticoagulation as an outpatient, but given her history of multiple CVAs,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke) x3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, atrial flutter, anemia, hyperthyroidism, and squamous cell tonsillar cancer. She is on various medications including phenytoin, heparin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, digoxin, diltiazem, and propylthiouracil.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis. It is important to monitor for any signs of seizure activity or changes in mental status.
2. Fevers and leukocytosis: The patient continues to have low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count. This may indicate an ongoing infection, possibly in the pulmonary system given the increased secretions. Monitoring for worsening symptoms and repeating cultures is necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to airway protection. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the chest x-ray shows a retrocardiac opacity that could be an infiltrate. Monitoring for worsening respiratory status and following guidelines for weaning off propofol is important.

   68 year old woman with PMH of CVA, tonsillar [**Hospital **] transferred from
   [**Hospital1 327**] with seizure, fever, and acute respiratory failure, intubated
   for airway protection. Seizure likely secondary to new CVA but
   completing 14 day course of empiric vanc/cftx/ampicillin for meningitis
   given that LP was obtained multiple days into course of antibiotics.
   Appears ready for extubation today. MiniBAL showed no growth on
   culture. Anticoagulated for afib. Rate controlled on dig/dilt. No
   evidence of ongoing seizure activity. Continue dilantin
 to be
   re-loaded today. PTU for hyperthyroidism, but this will need to be
   readressed. Further plans as per resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who was admitted to the ICU with seizure, fever, and acute respiratory failure. She required intubation for airway protection and is currently on a ventilator. The seizure was likely secondary to a new CVA. The patient is being treated with a 14-day course of empiric antibiotics for meningitis, although the lumbar puncture (LP) was done multiple days into the antibiotic course. Her MiniBAL showed no growth on culture. She is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation and is being rate-controlled on digoxin and diltiazem. There is no evidence of ongoing seizure activity, and she will continue to receive dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. The patient is also on propofol for sedation, and her blood glucose levels are being managed with regular insulin sliding scale. She has a multi-lumen central venous line, prophylactic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and measures in place to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases. Infectious
   evaluation as below
 LP not performed at OSH, LP negative on admission
   here, although had been on antibiotics; continuing to cover CNS
   infection empirically.  Home medications not known to contribute to
   seizure activity.  No report of toxicology screen on admission to OSH.
   No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative:
   acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated
   - Continue phenytoin; will reload today for level not at goal
   - On heparin for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin for empiric course *14 days  (day
   1 is [**12-8**])
   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Still with low grade temps to as high as
   100.6.  WBC count up to 11.7 (previously nml) with 81% neutrophils, no
   bands.  Etiology not entirely clear, but pulmonary possible source
   given increased secretions over past few days (currently improved). OSH
   BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and blood cultures from OSH
   were negative.  RIJ d/c
d on [**12-8**] and LIJ placed on [**12-8**] without
   erythema or discharge.  Patient
s LP was unrevealing but done in
   setting of antibiotics.
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin * 14 days (day 1 is [**12-8**])
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures - NGTD
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of seizure, altered mental status, aspiration.  Increasing secretions
   raise suspicion for new vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR with
   retrocardiac opacity, but this may represent atelectasis as opposed to
   infiltrate.  Ciprofloxacin added [**12-11**] to vanc/ceftriaxone/amp for
   double coverage of possible resistant gram negatives.
   - goal to extubate today
   # Atrial flutter:  Had been well rate-controlled with digoxin and
   diltiazem, however with episode of RVR overnight responsive to IV
   metoprolol; now rate improved.  Has been off anticoagulation as an
   outpatient (unclear why not on coumadin given a.fib/flutter and
   multiple CVAs).
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   # Anemia: Normocytic however with elevated RDW.  Unclear hct baseline
   although hct has remained stable in the high 20s range.   Guaiac
   negative on admission.   No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - check pm HCT todat as 3 pt hct drop o/n
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s). TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.  No acute
   issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers.
- The patient had been on continuous EEG monitoring, which did not show epileptiform focus. However, an MRI showed a new lesion on the left side, which could account for the seizures.
- The patient's infectious evaluation included a negative lumbar puncture (LP), negative HSV PCR, and no evidence of brain metastases. She was started on antibiotics empirically.
- The patient's fevers and leukocytosis are still present, with temperatures up to 100.6°F and a WBC count up to 11.7 (previously normal). The etiology of the fevers is unclear, but a pulmonary source is possible given increased secretions.
- The patient was intubated for airway protection due to seizure, altered mental status, and aspiration. There is suspicion for new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and ciprofloxacin was added to the antibiotics.
- The patient has atrial flutter, which has been well controlled with digoxin and diltiazem. However, she has been off anticoagulation as an outpatient, despite having a high CHADS score including past strokes.
- The patient has anemia, which is normocytic with an elevated RDW."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of encephalopathy. They have a history of allergies to Erbitux (Cetuximab) and are currently receiving multiple medications, including heparin sodium, dilantin, and various antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show an elevated blood pressure and heart rate, with stable temperature and oxygen saturation. They are in atrial flutter and require respiratory support. The patient's lab results indicate abnormal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, and potassium. Imaging studies have been performed but are not provided in the note. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial flutter, fever, hypothyroidism, respiratory failure, and seizure. Past medical history includes a cerebrovascular accident (stroke). The patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may worsen without proper management.
2. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizure, and ongoing neurological monitoring and management are necessary.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient is in atrial flutter, which requires close monitoring and possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases.  LP not performed
   at OSH, LP negative on admission here, although had been on
   antibiotics.  She is now s/p 14d amp/vanco/ctx.  No report of
   toxicology screen on admission to OSH.  No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no
   encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative: acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated
   - Continue phenytoin; will reload today for level not at goal
   - On heparin for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin for empiric course *14 days  (day
   1 is [**12-8**])
   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Still with low grade temps to as high as
   100.6.  WBC count up to 11.7 (previously nml) with 81% neutrophils, no
   bands.  Etiology not entirely clear, but pulmonary possible source
   given increased secretions over past few days (currently improved). OSH
   BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and blood cultures from OSH
   were negative.  RIJ d/c
d on [**12-8**] and LIJ placed on [**12-8**] without
   erythema or discharge.  Patient
s LP was unrevealing but done in
   setting of antibiotics.
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin * 14 days (day 1 is [**12-8**])
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures - NGTD
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of seizure, altered mental status, aspiration.  Increasing secretions
   raise suspicion for new vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR with
   retrocardiac opacity, but this may represent atelectasis as opposed to
   infiltrate.  Ciprofloxacin added [**12-11**] to vanc/ceftriaxone/amp for
   double coverage of possible resistant gram negatives.
   - goal to extubate today
   # Atrial flutter:  Had been well rate-controlled with digoxin and
   diltiazem, however with episode of RVR overnight responsive to IV
   metoprolol; now rate improved.  Has been off anticoagulation as an
   outpatient (unclear why not on coumadin given a.fib/flutter and
   multiple CVAs).
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   # Anemia: Normocytic however with elevated RDW.  Unclear hct baseline
   although hct has remained stable in the high 20s range.   Guaiac
   negative on admission.   No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - check pm HCT todat as 3 pt hct drop o/n
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s). TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.  No acute
   issues.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient has been diagnosed with encephalopathy, possibly due to an ambiguous new lesion on the left side of her brain, as shown by an MRI. Continuous EEG monitoring did not show epileptiform focus. The patient has been on antibiotics but still has low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis with 81% neutrophils. There is a possibility of a pulmonary source for the infection, given increased secretions over the past few days. Her blood, urine, and BAL cultures were negative. The patient is intubated for airway protection and there is suspicion for new vent-associated pneumonia. She has atrial flutter, which was well-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem but required IV metoprolol for rate control. The patient has anemia with an elevated RDW, unclear hct baseline, and negative guaiac on admission. She also has hyperthyroidism with unclear etiology and functioning nodules. The patient has a history of squamous cell tonsillar cancer, status post chemoradiation, with no acute issues. The patient is currently on ICU care with replete nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases.  LP not performed
   at OSH, LP negative on admission here, although had been on
   antibiotics.  She is now s/p 14d amp/vanco/ctx.  No report of
   toxicology screen on admission to OSH.  No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no
   encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative: acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated
   - Continue phenytoin; will repeat level in am after recent dose change
   - On heparin for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk
   - s/p 14 day empiric course of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin
   # Altered mental status:  Remains intermittently somnolent vs.
   agitated.  Is alert when awake, but does not follow commands and
   currently speaking is incomprehensible.  MRI with only tiny ? of
   infarct and seems unlikely full cause of current mental status.  ?
   post  nonconvulsive status prior to transfer here.  Delirium certainly
   playing large role given critical illness, prolonged ICU course and
   just off of sedating meds post extubation.
   - avoid sedating meds as possible even in setting of agitation
   # Fevers:  Afebrile x 24 hours.  Had been having daily low grade temps
   which may have been due to medications/antibiotics as she has been
   afebrile since discontinuation of abx.  Briefly had increased
   secretions while intubated which improved post extubation and after 4
   days course of ciprofloxacin.  Etiology not entirely clear, but
   pulmonary possible source given increased secretions over past few days
   (currently improved). OSH BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and
   blood cultures from OSH were negative.  RIJ d/c
d on [**12-8**] and LIJ
   placed on [**12-8**] without erythema or discharge.  Patient
s LP was
   unrevealing but done in setting of antibiotics.
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin * 14 days
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures - NGTD
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of seizure, altered mental status, aspiration.  Increasing secretions
   raise suspicion for new vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR with
   retrocardiac opacity, but this may represent atelectasis as opposed to
   infiltrate.  Ciprofloxacin added [**12-11**] to vanc/ceftriaxone/amp for
   double coverage of possible resistant gram negatives.
   - goal to extubate today
   # Atrial flutter:  Had been well rate-controlled with digoxin and
   diltiazem, however with episode of RVR overnight responsive to IV
   metoprolol; now rate improved.  Has been off anticoagulation as an
   outpatient (unclear why not on coumadin given a.fib/flutter and
   multiple CVAs).
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   # Anemia: Normocytic however with elevated RDW.  Unclear hct baseline
   although hct has remained stable in the high 20s range.   Guaiac
   negative on admission.   No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - check pm HCT todat as 3 pt hct drop o/n
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s). TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was admitted to the ICU with seizures and fevers. The patient had persistent epileptiform activity on EEG, but continuous EEG monitoring did not show any epileptiform focus. She also had a new lesion on MRI, which could account for the seizures. The patient was on antibiotics, but her LP was negative. She is now off antibiotics and showing no signs of encephalitis or HSV infection, so acyclovir was stopped.

The patient's mental status remains altered, with intermittent somnolence and agitation. She is alert when awake but does not follow commands and speaks incomprehensibly. The MRI showed only a small infarct, which is unlikely to be the full cause of her current mental status. Delirium is suspected due to her critical illness, prolonged ICU course, and recent discontinuation of sedating medications.

The patient had daily low-grade temperatures, which may have been due to medications or antibiotics. She improved after discontinuing antibiotics and receiving ciprofloxacin for suspected pulmonary source of infection. The patient's respiratory failure necessitated intubation for airway protection. There is a suspicion of new ventilator-associated pneumonia, and she has been on ciprofloxacin.

The patient has atrial flutter, which has been well controlled with digoxin"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, initially intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status, aspiration, and seizure. She has been on antibiotics for suspected infections, including MRSA, but cultures have been negative. Her recent vital signs show stable respiratory status since extubation, controlled atrial flutter with medication, and anemia with an elevated RDW. She also has hyperthyroidism, which is currently being managed with propylthiouracil. The patient's primary issues include seizures, altered mental status, fevers, respiratory failure, atrial flutter, anemia, and hyperthyroidism. She is now off antibiotics and her condition remains stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and persistent epileptiform activity on EEG. Although continuous EEG here did not show any epileptiform focus, there is an ambiguous new lesion on the left hemisphere, which could account for this. The patient is currently on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, and her phenytoin level will be repeated after the recent dose change.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient remains intermittently somnolent vs"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases. Infectious
   evaluation as below
 LP not performed at OSH, LP negative on admission
   here, although had been on antibiotics; continuing to cover CNS
   infection empirically.  Home medications not known to contribute to
   seizure activity.  No report of toxicology screen on admission to OSH.
   No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative:
   acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated
   - Continue phenytoin; will reload today for level not at goal
   - On heparin for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin for empiric course *14 days  (day
   1 is [**12-8**])
   # Fevers, leukocytosis: Still with low grade temps to as high as
   100.6.  WBC count up to 11.7 (previously nml) with 81% neutrophils, no
   bands.  Etiology not entirely clear, but pulmonary possible source
   given increased secretions over past few days (currently improved). OSH
   BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and blood cultures from OSH
   were negative.  RIJ d/c
d on [**12-8**] and LIJ placed on [**12-8**] without
   erythema or discharge.  Patient
s LP was unrevealing but done in
   setting of antibiotics.
   - Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin * 14 days (day 1 is [**12-8**])
   - Sputum, urine, blood cultures - NGTD
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of seizure, altered mental status, aspiration.  Increasing secretions
   raise suspicion for new vent-associated pneumonia.  CXR with
   retrocardiac opacity, but this may represent atelectasis as opposed to
   infiltrate.  Ciprofloxacin added [**12-11**] to vanc/ceftriaxone/amp for
   double coverage of possible resistant gram negatives.
   - goal to extubate today
   # Atrial flutter:  Had been well rate-controlled with digoxin and
   diltiazem, however with episode of RVR overnight responsive to IV
   metoprolol; now rate improved.  Has been off anticoagulation as an
   outpatient (unclear why not on coumadin given a.fib/flutter and
   multiple CVAs).
   - Continue digoxin and diltiazem for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   # Anemia: Normocytic however with elevated RDW.  Unclear hct baseline
   although hct has remained stable in the high 20s range.   Guaiac
   negative on admission.   No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - check pm HCT todat as 3 pt hct drop o/n
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s). TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.  No acute
   issues.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient's chief complaint includes encephalopathy and an allergic reaction to Erbitux (Cetuximab). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/89 mmHg to 129/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has atrial flutter and is on heparin prophylaxis due to a high ongoing stroke risk. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of seizures and fevers. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as increased levels of lactic acid and decreased levels of albumin and calcium. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. 

The patient's imaging studies reveal a new ambiguous lesion on the left hemisphere, which could potentially be responsible for the seizures. There is no evidence of brain metastases. Infectious evaluation has been performed, including a lumbar puncture (LP) that was negative on admission here, although the patient had been on antibiotics.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital due to seizures and fevers. The patient has completed a two-week course of antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Seizures: The patient had persistent epileptiform activity in the left cerebral hemisphere, but continuous EEG performed here did not show any epileptiform focus. The prior CVA may be responsible, but there is also a new lesion on the left side per MRI. No evidence of brain metastases. LP was negative on admission here, although she had been on antibiotics. She is now on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), specifically phenytoin, and will repeat the level in the morning after a recent dose change. She is also on anticoagulation for prophylaxis due to high ongoing stroke risk.
2. Altered mental status: The patient was agitated yesterday, and delirium seems to be playing a large role given her critical illness, prolonged ICU course, and recent discontinuation of sedating medications post-extubation. It is unclear if this is the patient's new baseline. MRI shows only a tiny infarct and seems unlikely to be the full cause of her current mental status.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's rate control has improved with the addition of atenolol back"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, transferred from [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with new onset
   seizures and fevers, has completed 2 week course of empiric abx
   treatment for HAP, currently doing well.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases.  LP not performed
   at OSH, LP negative on admission here, although had been on
   antibiotics.  She is now s/p 14d amp/vanco/ctx.  No report of
   toxicology screen on admission to OSH.  No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no
   encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative: acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated
   - Continue phenytoin; will repeat level in am after recent dose change
   - On anticoagulation for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk
   - s/p 14 day empiric course of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin
   # Altered mental status:  Was agitated yesterday. Delirium certainly
   playing large role given critical illness, prolonged ICU course and
   just off of sedating meds post extubation. Unclear if this is pt
s new
   baseline. Improved today. MRI with only tiny ? of infarct and seems
   unlikely full cause of current mental status.
   # Atrial flutter:  Improved rate control with the addition of atenolol
   back to digoxin and diltiazem.  Has been off anticoagulation as an
   outpatient (unclear why not on coumadin given a.fib/flutter and
   multiple CVAs).
   - Continue digoxin, diltiazem, atenolol for rate control
   - titrate up diltiazem as needed for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   - coumadin started
   - monitor PTT/INR
   # Anemia: Normocytic -  Unclear baseline. Guaiac negative on
   admission.  Stable.
   - daily HCT
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s). TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness
   - Recheck TFTs in AM
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation, difficult
   intubation.  No acute issues.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Likely will need PEG tube. TFs held due to aspiration risk.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and seizure disorder. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to new-onset seizures and fevers. The patient completed a two-week course of empiric antibiotic treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is currently doing well.

The patient's recent medical history includes:
- Seizures: The patient had persistent epileptiform activity on EEG from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere. Continuous EEG performed here did not show any epileptiform focus. A new lesion on MRI could account for this. The patient underwent a 14-day course of antibiotics, and toxicology screening was not performed. There is no evidence of brain metastases, and HSV PCR was negative. Phenytoin therapy was continued, and the level will be repeated after the recent dose change. Anticoagulation was started for prophylaxis due to high ongoing stroke risk.
- Altered mental status: The patient was agitated yesterday, but today's improvement suggests that delirium may be playing a large role in her critical illness and prolonged ICU course. It is unclear if this is the patient's new baseline. MRI showed only a tiny infarct, and it seems unlikely to be the full cause of her current mental status.
- Atrial flutter: Rate control has improved with the addition of atenol"

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of stroke, atrial flutter, fever, hypothyroidism, respiratory failure, and seizure. The patient is currently on multiple medications including Erbitux (Cetuximab), Haloperidol (Haldol), Lorazepam (Ativan), Pantoprazole (Protonix), Dilantin, and Hydralazine. The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (121 bpm), high blood pressure (169/71 mmHg), and a normal respiratory rate (24 breaths per minute) with an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.9°C. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted conditions. The patient has received antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin) in the past 24 hours. The patient's flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tissue Perfusion Alteration: The patient's altered tissue perfusion may be due to hypotension and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter can lead to irregular heart rhythms, potentially causing decreased cardiac output and symptoms such as dizziness or fainting.
3. Fever: The patient's fever may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation. It should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3,
   tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures transferred from
   [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with seizures and fevers.
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases.  LP not performed
   at OSH, LP negative on admission here, although had been on
   antibiotics.  She is now s/p 14d amp/vanco/ctx.  No report of
   toxicology screen on admission to OSH.  No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no
   encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative: acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated
   - Continue phenytoin; will repeat level in am after recent dose change
   - On heparin for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk
   - s/p 14 day empiric course of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin
   # Altered mental status:  Remains intermittently somnolent vs.
   agitated.  Is alert when awake, but does not follow commands and
   currently speaking is incomprehensible.  MRI with only tiny ? of
   infarct and seems unlikely full cause of current mental status.  ?
   post  nonconvulsive status prior to transfer here.  Delirium certainly
   playing large role given critical illness, prolonged ICU course and
   just off of sedating meds post extubation.
   - avoid sedating meds as possible even in setting of agitation
   # Fevers:  Afebrile x 24 hours.  Had been having daily low grade temps
   which may have been due to medications/antibiotics as she has been
   afebrile since discontinuation of abx.  Briefly had increased
   secretions while intubated which improved post extubation and after 4
   days course of ciprofloxacin.  OSH BAL from admission grew only yeast,
   urine and blood cultures from OSH were negative.   Sputum culture here
   grew sparse MRSA but without infiltrate on CXR.  RIJ d/c
d on [**12-8**] and
   LIJ placed on [**12-8**] without erythema or discharge.  Patient
s LP was
   unrevealing but done in setting of antibiotics.
   - off antibiotics since [**12-14**]
   - f/u outstanding culture data
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable respiratory status since extubation on
   [**12-13**].  Was initially intubated for airway protection in the setting of
   seizure, altered mental status, aspiration.  Increasing secretions
   raised suspicion for new vent-associated pneumonia, but CXR without
   clear infiltrate and had no secretions prior to extubation.
   Ciprofloxacin added [**12-11**] to vanc/ceftriaxone/amp for double coverage
   of possible resistant gram negatives; all abx discontinued [**12-14**].
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   # Atrial flutter:  Improved rate control with the addition of atenolol
   back to digoxin and diltiazem.  Has been off anticoagulation as an
   outpatient (unclear why not on coumadin given a.fib/flutter and
   multiple CVAs).
   - Continue digoxin, diltiazem, atenolol for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   - will start coumadin as she will need to be bridged; will need to
   follow phenytoin levels as can interact
   # Anemia: Normocytic however with elevated RDW.  Unclear hct baseline
   although hct has remained stable in the high 20s range.   Guaiac
   negative on admission.   No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - check pm HCT todat as 3 pt hct drop o/n
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   # Hyperthyroidism: Unclear etiology - Grave's disease versus
   functioning nodule(s). TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness
   - Recheck TFTs in AM
   - Continue propylthiouracil
   # Squamous cell tonsillar cancer: Status post chemoradiation.  No acute
   issues.
   - Monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Likely will need PEG tube. TFs held due to aspiration risk.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient has been experiencing intermittent seizures, altered mental status, and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She also has atrial flutter and anemia. Additionally, she has hyperthyroidism, squamous cell tonsillar cancer status post chemoradiation, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and continues to experience them. Continuous EEG did not show epileptiform focus, but persistent epileptiform activity from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere was seen on prior EEG. This indicates the possibility of recurrent seizures, which can be managed with antiepileptic medications.
2. Altered mental status: The patient remains intermittently somnolent versus agitated. The MRI showed only a tiny infarct, making it unlikely to be the full cause of the current mental status. Delirium is likely playing a large role given the critical illness, prolonged ICU course, and recent discontinuation of sedating medications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated for air"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 3, tonsillar carcinoma, and no known history of seizures. She was transferred from another hospital with seizures and fevers. The patient has been experiencing intermittent somnolence and agitation, alert when awake but unable to follow commands. She also has altered mental status, which is not fully explained by the tiny infarct seen on MRI. The patient's fevers have resolved since discontinuing antibiotics. She was initially intubated for airway protection due to seizure, altered mental status, and aspiration. Her respiratory status has been stable since extubation. The patient has atrial flutter, for which rate control medications have been adjusted. She also has anemia and hyperthyroidism, both of which require further evaluation and management. The patient has a history of squamous cell tonsillar cancer, treated with chemoradiation, but currently has no acute issues related to this condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and persistent epileptiform activity on EEG indicate a risk of recurrent seizures. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's neurological status and consider adjusting antiepileptic medication levels as needed.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and intermittent somnolence suggest delirium, which can be caused by critical illness, prolonged ICU stay, and recent discontinuation of sedating medications. Avoiding sedating medications and providing appropriate orientation and stimulation may help manage delirium.
3. Respiratory failure: Although the patient's respiratory status has stabilized since extubation, close monitoring is still necessary. The possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be considered, and cultures should be reviewed for any growth of pathogens. Appropriate measures to prevent and treat VAP should be implemented if indicated.
4. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter requires ongoing rate control management. Adjustments to medication doses and consideration of anticoagulation therapy are important to prevent thromboembolic events, given the patient's high CHADS score and history of multiple CVAs.
5. Anemia: The patient's normocytic anemia requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. Regular monitoring of hematocrit levels and transfusion if necessary are important to maintain adequate oxygen delivery.
6. Hyperthyroidism: The patient's unclear etiology of hyperthyroidism needs to be further investigated to determine the cause, such as Grave's disease or functioning thyroid nodules. Rechecking thyroid function tests and continuing propylthiouracil are necessary to manage hyperthyroidism.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple comorbidities and potential medical complications. Close monitoring and individualized management are crucial to optimize her outcomes."

   seizures and fevers, has completed 2 week course of empiric abx
   treatment for HAP, currently doing well.
   .
   # Seizures: OSH EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity from a
   focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous
   EEG monitoring.  Continuous EEG performed here did not show
   epileptiform focus.  Her prior CVA may be responsible; however there is
   also an ambiguous new
tiny
 lesion per MRI on the left which could
   account for this.  No evidence of brain metastases.  LP not performed
   at OSH, LP negative on admission here, although had been on
   antibiotics.  She is now s/p 14d amp/vanco/ctx.  No report of
   toxicology screen on admission to OSH.  No clot by ECHO.  MRI showed no
   encephalitis and HSV PCR was negative: acyclovir stopped.
   - Neurology recs appreciated
   - Continue phenytoin; will repeat level Monday AM after recent dose
   change
   - On anticoagulation for prophylaxis given high on-going stroke risk
   - s/p 14 day empiric course of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Was agitated yesterday. Delirium certainly
   playing large role given critical illness, prolonged ICU course and
   just off of sedating meds post extubation. Unclear if this is pt
s new
   baseline. Improved today. MRI with only tiny ? of infarct and seems
   unlikely full cause of current mental status.
   - d/w family regarding underlying mental status
   .
   # Atrial flutter:  Improved rate control with the addition of atenolol
   back to digoxin and diltiazem.  Has been off anticoagulation as an
   outpatient (unclear why not on coumadin given a.fib/flutter and
   multiple CVAs).
   - Continue digoxin, diltiazem, atenolol for rate control
   - titrate up diltiazem as needed for rate control
   - On heparin gtt , given high CHADS score including past strokes
   - coumadin started

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of three cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), tonsillar carcinoma, and current symptoms of seizures, fever, and altered mental status. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has completed a two-week course of empiric antibiotic treatment. The patient is now doing well.

Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has experienced new onset seizures, which could be due to a prior cerebrovascular accident or a new lesion seen on MRI. Continuous EEG monitoring did not show any epileptiform focus, so further evaluation is needed.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with agitation and delirium contributing to her critical illness and prolonged ICU course. MRI results show a tiny infarct, but it seems unlikely to be the sole cause of her current mental status.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient has improved rate control with the addition of atenolol, digoxin, and diltiazem. She should continue with these medications for rate control and be placed on heparin due to a high CHADS score including past strokes. Coumadin should also be started, and her PTT/INR should be monitored.
4. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia with an unclear baseline. Guaiac negative on admission. Her hematocrit is stable"
