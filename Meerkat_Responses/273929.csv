   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   1L NS bolus x2 given. 1unit FFP and 1unit platelets given at MN, plt ck
   post transfusion. Additional 3units FFPs and 1unit Plts given to
   maintain plt count >50 for procedure.
   -Cipro started for double coverage as patient has GNRs
   -Started tramadol b/c would not cause spasms of gallbladder sphincter
   for HIDA scan. Will give dilaudid after if he needs.
   - Hida scan showed a gallbladder that would not fill. IR would not do
   cholecystostomy b/c of coags and low platelets. Gave a 6 pack of plts.
   and 4 units of FFP. INR 2.5->2.2; Plts 47->55. Not a good response. So,
   IR would not do the procedure Friday. Agreed to re-assess Saturday
   morning. (spoke with [**Doctor Last Name 9186**]) He will get 4 units of ffp and 6
   pack of plts prior to lab draw in AM. Will likely need more after, so
   will have this order ready and hold prn. IR number [**Serial Number 9187**]

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis and sepsis
   # Acute cholecystitis :  . HIDA scan did not fill gallbladder,
   concerning as high pressure gallbladder needs to be removed.  Per
   surgery he is not a surgical candidiate .  IR planning on doing
   cholycystostomy today, as platelets are normalized and coags are
   normal. The differential also includes SBP (88 % polys on the
   peritoneal fluid differential) and GNR in peritoneum
   -  Cholecystostomy today per IR. Will reserve 4 units of FFP and 1 bag
   of platelets prior to procedure.
   -  Continue double coverage for pseudomonas with cipro and zosyn and
   continue empiric vanc until final cultures return
   -  IVF boluses prn for MAPs < 65. Patient has not required
   pressors..will continue to monitor. If BP not controlled, consider
   starting levophed
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  Ultram for pain; if significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Sepsis:  Lactate still significantly elevated at 5, but coming
   down.  Most likely secondary to infection.  Potential infectious
   sources include biliary infection from acute cholecystitis (also
   causing secondary bacterial peritonitis), SBP,
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc and zosyn, cipro)
   while cultures are pending.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data.
   #  Change in mental status:  Per report from the ED, his family thought
   he had change in mental status.  On exam here he was oriented, but he
   has unknown baseline.  In the setting of his acute illness and
   decreased bowel movements most likely his change in mental status was
   due to hepatic encephalopathy.  Also in the differential is delirium or
   infection (UTI, SBP, bacteremia). Patient currently clear and oriented
   throughout the night.
   - Clarify baseline with family in the am.
   - Treatment of possible hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose
   - UCx pending.  F/U blood cultures and peritoneal cultures
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an INR of 1.8.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - As above, lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Holding aldactone, lasix, and nadolol due to potential for him to
   drop his blood pressures if he becomes septic.
   - Consider adding midodrine and octreotide
   #  Metabolic acidosis:  The patient has an anion gap of 13, but a low
   albumin around 2.8 so he has a slight anion gap metabolic acidosis as
   well as a non-anion gap acidosis.  His gap acidosis is likely from
   lactic acidosis (he had a lactate of 5.8).  He had the non-gap acidosis
   on presentation to the OSH and his Cl is not elevated so unlikely
   secondary to NS resuscitation.  Possibly due to bicarb loss from
   frequent stools secondary to lactulose.
   - Recheck panel and switch to D5 with bicarb if acidemic from NS as
   liver patient
s can
t metabolize bicarb in LR
makes them more acidemic
   - Trend lactate
   #  Hyponatremia:  Per OSH records the patient's Na was 126, now 133
   here.  Was found to be dry at the OSH and given IVF.  As his Na is
   correcting with volume repletion, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Continue to trend.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  The patient's plt are at 52 which per the OSH
   records is near his baseline.  Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets as needed
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.5, however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8.  His K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - Trend Cr
    - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and type II diabetes mellitus (DMII). He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and sepsis. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 107/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 73%.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13,400 cells/mm³, elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), and hyperbilirubinemia. His coagulation profile reveals a prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 20/1.8 and a decreased platelet count of 47,000 cells/mm³. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient has received multiple blood product transfusions to maintain his platelet count above 50,000 cells/mm³. He has also received broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis secondary to acute cholecystitis and possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). 

The patient's physical examination reveals sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, clear lung fields, regular heart"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis and sepsis
   # Acute cholecystitis :  . HIDA scan did not fill gallbladder,
   concerning as high pressure gallbladder needs to be removed.  Per
   surgery he is not a surgical candidiate .  IR planning on doing
   cholycystostomy today, as platelets are normalized and coags are
   normal. The differential also includes SBP (88 % polys on the
   peritoneal fluid differential) as GNR in peritoneal fluid
   -  Cholecystostomy today per IR. Will reserve 4 units of FFP and 1 bag
   of platelets prior to procedure.
   -  Continue double coverage for pseudomonas with cipro and zosyn and
   continue empiric vanc until final cultures return
   -  IVF boluses prn for MAPs < 65. Patient has not required
   pressors..will continue to monitor. If BP not controlled, consider
   starting levophed
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Sepsis:  Lactate still significantly elevated at 5, but coming
   down.  Most likely secondary to infection in abdomen, from
   gallbladder.,
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc and zosyn, cipro)
   while cultures are pending.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data.
   #  Change in mental status:  Per report from the ED, his family thought
   he had change in mental status.  On exam here he was oriented, but he
   has unknown baseline.  In the setting of his acute illness and
   decreased bowel movements most likely his change in mental status was
   due to hepatic encephalopathy.  Also in the differential is delirium in
   setting of sepsis. Patient currently clear and oriented throughout the
   night.
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Treatment of possible hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose
   - UCx pending.  F/U blood cultures and peritoneal cultures
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an INR of 1.8.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - As above, lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Holding aldactone, lasix, and nadolol due to potential for him to
   drop his blood pressures if he becomes septic.
   - Increasing oxygen requirements, likely from ascetic fluid. Will
   monitor after pericentesis today.
   Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor Hcts, especially after procedure.
   #  Metabolic acidosis:  Lactic Acidosis and likely nongap acidosis from
   diarrhea. Improving.
   - Recheck panel and switch to D5 with bicarb if acidemic from NS as
   liver patient
s can
t metabolize bicarb in LR
makes them more acidemic
   - Trend lactate
   #  Hyponatremia:  Resolving. Per OSH records the patient's Na was 126,
   now 133 here.  Was found to be dry at the OSH and given IVF.  As his Na
   is correcting with volume repletion, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Continue to trend.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  The patient's plt are at 52 which per the OSH
   records is near his baseline.  Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets to greater than 50.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.5, however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8.  His K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - Trend Cr
    - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and sepsis. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an INR of 1.8, indicating impaired liver function. This condition requires treatment with lactulose to reduce ammonia levels.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his gallbladder infection. He is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics while cultures are pending.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if fluid resuscitation leads to fluid overload or if there is inadequate renal perfusion.
4. Bleeding: Given the patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia, he is at high risk for bleeding. Monitoring his Hct and providing platelet transfusions if necessary is important.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's lactic"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis and sepsis
   # Acute cholecystitis:  HIDA scan did not fill gallbladder,  concern
   that needs surgical removal, but pt not a surgical candidiate .  IR did
   cholycystostomy [**9-13**].
   -  s/p Cholecystostomy by IR.
   -  Continue double coverage for pseudomonas with cipro and zosyn and
   continue empiric vanc until final cultures return
   -  IVF boluses prn for MAPs < 65. Patient has not required
   pressors..will continue to monitor. If BP not controlled, consider
   starting levophed
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Sepsis:  Lactate still significantly elevated at 5, but started
   trending down yesterday.  Most likely secondary to bacterial
   peritonitis secondary to gallbladder infection.  SBP (88 % polys on the
   peritoneal fluid differential) as GNR in peritoneal fluid
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc and zosyn, cipro)
   while cultures are pending.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data.
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt clear and oriented currently
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - UCx pending.  F/U blood cultures and peritoneal cultures
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - As above, continue lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Restarted nadolol overnight
   - Holding aldactone, lasix due to potential for him to drop his blood
   pressures if he becomes septic.
   - Increasing oxygen requirements, likely from ascitic fluid. Will
   monitor after pericentesis today.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor Hcts, especially after procedure.
   #  Metabolic acidosis:  Presented w lactic Acidosis and likely nongap
   acidosis from diarrhea in addition to probable primary respiratory
   alkalosis from cirrhotic disease. No longer has gap acidosis.
   - Continue to monitor and switch to D5 with bicarb if acidemic from NS
   as liver patient
s can
t metabolize bicarb in LR
   - Trend lactate
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  The patient's plt are at 45, baseline in 50s,
   likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets to greater than 50.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - Trend Cr
    - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with acute cholecystitis and sepsis, and has undergone various interventions including paracentesis, cholecystostomy, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, anemia, metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, history of CAD/CHF, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has known cirrhosis and evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR. He is dependent on lactulose at home, and there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status and continued lactulose administration are important.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis from a gallbladder infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, lactate levels, and culture data will be crucial for early identification and management of sepsis.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a ventricular rate in the upper 90s and lower 100s. It is important to monitor"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis and sepsis
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].
   -  Continue double coverage for pseudomonas with cipro and zosyn and
   continue empiric vanc until final cultures return
   -  IVF boluses prn for MAPs < 65. Patient has not required
   pressors..will continue to monitor. If BP not controlled, consider
   starting levophed
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Sepsis:  Lactate still significantly elevated at 5, but started
   trending down yesterday.  Most likely secondary to bacterial
   peritonitis secondary to gallbladder infection.  SBP (88 % polys on the
   peritoneal fluid differential) as GNR in peritoneal fluid
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc and zosyn, cipro)
   while cultures are pending.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data.
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt clear and oriented currently
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - UCx pending.  F/U blood cultures and peritoneal cultures
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - As above, continue lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Restarted nadolol overnight
   - Holding aldactone, lasix due to potential for him to drop his blood
   pressures if he becomes septic.
   - Increasing oxygen requirements, likely from ascitic fluid. Will
   monitor after pericentesis today.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor Hcts, especially after procedure.
   #  Metabolic acidosis:  Presented w lactic Acidosis and likely nongap
   acidosis from diarrhea in addition to probable primary respiratory
   alkalosis from cirrhotic disease. No longer has gap acidosis.
   - Continue to monitor and switch to D5 with bicarb if acidemic from NS
   as liver patient
s can
t metabolize bicarb in LR
   - Trend lactate
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  The patient's plt are at 45, baseline in 50s,
   likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets to greater than 50.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - Trend Cr
    - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and sepsis. The patient underwent cholecystostomy by interventional radiology (IR) and is currently draining brown sludge. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), while cultures are pending.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with persistent tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased urine output. He has required IV fluid boluses and pressor support. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, and his central venous pressure (CVP) has been low. The patient's respiratory status has also been concerning, with increased oxygen requirements, likely due to ascitic fluid.

The patient's mental status has been altered, possibly secondary to sepsis. He has not had a bowel movement since September 13th. He is dependent on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, which he takes at home. His liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes, and his coagulation profile indicates a prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR).

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, who was admitted with sepsis secondary to cholecystitis and bacterial peritonitis. The patient underwent drainage of the biliary system and therapeutic paracentesis yesterday. He tolerated the paracentesis well and remains off pressors with a mildly positive fluid balance. The patient is currently being treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro and awaiting culture results.

The patient also has cholecystitis, for which drainage will be maintained pending resolution. Additionally, the patient has a history of cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, ascites, atrial fibrillation, and liver-related issues such as elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.7 F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 107/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), diminished breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and soft abdomen.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 47 K/uL, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 185 mg/dL, and liver function tests indicating possible liver dysfunction."

   - ABG (w non-rebreather): 7.33/54/107
   - had been lying on his left side, so much of abdominal fluids probably
   shifted into left pleural cavity; also had received 14L? extra in last
   couple of days
   - didn't respond to lasix 20mg IV, so tried 40mg IV lasix
   - ABG: with non-invasive ventilation BIPAP for 1.5 hrs-- 7.36/52/95
   - switched back to non-rebreather for comfort
   - switched back to Bipap for a couple of hours
   - A-line placed right radial, ABG 21:00 unchanged, pt feels
   subjectively more difficulty breathing-->  INTUBATED at 21:50 by
   anesthesia, placed on AC w tidal volumes 450cc
   -> Intubation done w intention of improving respiratory status to buy
   us more time to get the fluid out of his chest cavity -- thought to be
   positional from belly; will likely tap 5-6L [**9-15**] to help
   - OG tube placed for tube feeds
   - started on phenylephrine pressor to maintain BP, likely because of
   increased sedation from intubation procedure,  hopefully can be weaned
   once extra intubation sedation wears off by morning; on midaz and
   fentanyl currently for sedation, did get some propofol during

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR today with ?
   atelectasis versus pleural effusions
   -          Esoaphageal balloon study to evaluate pleural pressures.
   -          Pending esophageal balloon study, consider pericentesis
   today to drain ascites as this will help his fluid overload
   -          Consider lasix to decrease pulmonary effusions
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures.  Can d/c cipro
   and vanc given cultures with E. Coli.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data
   - repeat blood culture, send sputum culture and repeat peritoneal
   culture if pericentesis today
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   dark brown.
   -  Continue zosyn and d/c vanc and cipro as above
   -  will check KUB per surgery recs
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  Cr now increasing, likely due to combination
   intravascular volume depletion, phenylephrine, and ? abdominal
   compartment syndrome.  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr.  Will hold
   for now pending results from bladder pressure and esophageal balloon
   study
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - will check bladder pressure to evaluate for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome and consider pericentesis if bladder pressure > 20
   cm H2O
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  D/C nadolol
   now given HR well-controlled and other potential causes for minimal
   tachycardia
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend platelets, coags and LFTs
   - Pericentesis today if elevated bladder/pleural pressure
   - Continue lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   Add Erythromycin for gastric motility.  Goal [**3-16**] BMs today
   - Hold nadolol for now
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood and peritoneal cultures
   - check ammonia
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now
   improving, likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion in
   setting of worse ascites
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor Hcts, especially after procedure.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 108
   - continue to trend
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, and prostate cancer. He presented with nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. His condition has rapidly deteriorated, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He also has acute cholecystitis, sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis with encephalopathy, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, history of CAD/dCHF, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, which is causing systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Cholecystitis: The patient has acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. It is being managed with cholecystostomy and antibiotics.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function has worsened, likely due to volume depletion, phenylephrine use, and abdominal compartment syndrome.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**9-14**]:
   - ABG (w non-rebreather): 7.33/54/107
   - had been lying on his left side, so much of abdominal fluids probably
   shifted into left pleural cavity; also had received 14L? extra in last
   couple of days
   - didn't respond to lasix 20mg IV, so tried 40mg IV lasix
   - ABG: with non-invasive ventilation BIPAP for 1.5 hrs-- 7.36/52/95
   - switched back to non-rebreather for comfort
   - switched back to Bipap for a couple of hours
   - A-line placed right radial, ABG 21:00 unchanged, pt feels
   subjectively more difficulty breathing-->  INTUBATED at 21:50 by
   anesthesia, placed on AC w tidal volumes 450cc
   -> Intubation done w intention of improving respiratory status to buy
   us more time to get the fluid out of his chest cavity -- thought to be
   positional from belly; will likely tap 5-6L [**9-15**] to help
   - OG tube placed for tube feeds
   - started on phenylephrine pressor to maintain BP, likely because of
   increased sedation from intubation procedure,  hopefully can be weaned
   once extra intubation sedation wears off by morning; on midaz and
   fentanyl currently for sedation, did get some propofol during

   she doesn't understand well and would rather explain to her mother
   herself
   [**Name2 (NI) 156**] status: Full code for now (per daughter, HCP)
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and acute cholecystitis. He was found to have hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated on [9-14]. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to cholecystitis with gram-negative rods (GNR) in the peritoneal fluid. He has also been diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, history of CAD/dCHF, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 117/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 53 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 148 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is somnolent and oriented though slow to answer, with mild distress, lying on his left side. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezes, rales, or ronchi. His abdomen is soft, obese with a positive fluid wave, and increased tenderness of the right upper quadrant (RUQ). He has a cholecystostomy tube draining brown liquid from the RUQ. His extremities are warm, well perfused, and show no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Neurological examination reveals mild asterixis present.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 10.8 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 65 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.6 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 133 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.0 mEq/L, and glucose of 199 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal mediastinal widening likely secondary to significant left lower lobe atelectasis and significant left pleural effusion. The patient's fluid culture (preliminary) shows gram-negative rods (GNR) with sparse growth.

The patient's current plan includes pericentesis today to drain ascites, continuation of lasix to decrease pulmonary effusions, volume resuscitation with goal urine output (UOP) of 30 cc/hr and mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and central venous pressure (C"

   Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting, RUQ abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   [**9-14**]:
   - ABG (w non-rebreather): 7.33/54/107
   - had been lying on his left side, so much of abdominal fluids probably
   shifted into left pleural cavity; also had received 14L? extra in last
   couple of days
   - didn't respond to lasix 20mg IV, so tried 40mg IV lasix
   - ABG: with non-invasive ventilation BIPAP for 1.5 hrs-- 7.36/52/95
   - switched back to non-rebreather for comfort
   - switched back to Bipap for a couple of hours
   - A-line placed right radial, ABG 21:00 unchanged, pt feels
   subjectively more difficulty breathing-->  INTUBATED at 21:50 by
   anesthesia, placed on AC w tidal volumes 450cc
   -> Intubation done w intention of improving respiratory status to buy
   us more time to get the fluid out of his chest cavity -- thought to be
   positional from belly; will likely tap 5-6L [**9-15**] to help
   - OG tube placed for tube feeds
   - started on phenylephrine pressor to maintain BP, likely because of
   increased sedation from intubation procedure,  hopefully can be weaned
   once extra intubation sedation wears off by morning; on midaz and
   fentanyl currently for sedation, did get some propofol during
   intubation procedure

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, and was found to have acute cholecystitis. He underwent cholecystostomy and intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical complications include sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis with encephalopathy, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, history of CAD/dCHF, DMII, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, acute kidney injury, heart failure exacerbation, hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and increased INR, further deterioration in mental status, and potential complications related to the patient's other comorbidities such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status to promptly identify any worsening of these conditions and intervene accordingly."

   Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting, RUQ abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   [**9-14**]:
   - ABG (w non-rebreather): 7.33/54/107
   - had been lying on his left side, so much of abdominal fluids probably
   shifted into left pleural cavity; also had received 14L? extra in last
   couple of days
   - didn't respond to lasix 20mg IV, so tried 40mg IV lasix
   - ABG: with non-invasive ventilation BIPAP for 1.5 hrs-- 7.36/52/95
   - switched back to non-rebreather for comfort
   - switched back to Bipap for a couple of hours
   - A-line placed right radial, ABG 21:00 unchanged, pt feels
   subjectively more difficulty breathing-->  INTUBATED at 21:50 by
   anesthesia, placed on AC w tidal volumes 450cc
   -> Intubation done w intention of improving respiratory status to buy
   us more time to get the fluid out of his chest cavity -- thought to be
   positional from belly; will likely tap 5-6L [**9-15**] to help
   - OG tube placed for tube feeds
   - started on phenylephrine pressor to maintain BP, likely because of
   increased sedation from intubation procedure,  hopefully can be weaned
   once extra intubation sedation wears off by morning; on midaz and
   fentanyl currently for sedation, did get some propofol during

   atelectasis versus pleural effusions
   -          Esoaphageal balloon study to evaluate pleural pressures.
   -          Pending esophageal balloon study, consider pericentesis
   today to drain ascites as this will help his fluid overload
   -          Consider lasix to decrease pulmonary effusions
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Continue  vanc, zosyn, cipro (Day 1:  while cultures are pending.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].
   -  Continue double coverage for pseudomonas with cipro and zosyn and
   continue empiric vanc until final cultures return
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - Trend Cr
    - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend platelets, coags and LFTs
   - Pericentesis today
   - Continue lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Continue nadolol for rate control and ?varices
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood and peritoneal cultures
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor Hcts, especially after procedure.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  The patient's plt are at 45, baseline in 50s,
   likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets to greater than 50.
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and acute cholecystitis. He presented with nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, and was found to have acute cholecystitis. He underwent cholecystostomy and intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, a history of CAD/dCHF, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to bacterial peritonitis, which can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function may worsen due to fluid overload, sepsis, or other underlying conditions, leading to further deterioration in kidney function.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ventricular rates are high, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and increased risk of thromboembolic events.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's liver disease can progress"

   atelectasis versus pleural effusions
   -          Esoaphageal balloon study to evaluate pleural pressures.
   -          Pending esophageal balloon study, consider pericentesis
   today to drain ascites as this will help his fluid overload
   -          Consider lasix to decrease pulmonary effusions
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Was covered vanc, zosyn, cipro.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].
   -  Continue double coverage for pseudomonas with cipro and zosyn and
   continue empiric vanc until final cultures return
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - Trend Cr
    - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend platelets, coags and LFTs
   - Pericentesis today
   - Continue lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Continue nadolol for rate control and ?varices
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood and peritoneal cultures
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor Hcts, especially after procedure.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  The patient's plt are at 45, baseline in 50s,
   likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets to greater than 50.
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   [**Name2 (NI) 156**] status: Full code for now (per daughter, HCP)
   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, who presented with acute cholecystitis and subsequently underwent cholecystostomy. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis. The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to his hypoxic respiratory failure. Intubation was performed to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further deterioration due to sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis. Active coverage with antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro) is ongoing, and cultures are pending.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is unclear, but there has been an acute deterioration. Fluid management should be carefully monitored to maintain adequate renal perfusion.
4. Cirrhosis with Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has known cirrhosis and evidence of hepatic encephal"

   Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting, RUQ abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   [**9-14**]:
   - ABG (w non-rebreather): 7.33/54/107
   - had been lying on his left side, so much of abdominal fluids probably
   shifted into left pleural cavity; also had received 14L? extra in last
   couple of days
   - didn't respond to lasix 20mg IV, so tried 40mg IV lasix
   - ABG: with non-invasive ventilation BIPAP for 1.5 hrs-- 7.36/52/95
   - switched back to non-rebreather for comfort
   - switched back to Bipap for a couple of hours
   - A-line placed right radial, ABG 21:00 unchanged, pt feels
   subjectively more difficulty breathing-->  INTUBATED at 21:50 by
   anesthesia, placed on AC w tidal volumes 450cc
   -> Intubation done w intention of improving respiratory status to buy
   us more time to get the fluid out of his chest cavity -- thought to be
   positional from belly; will likely tap 5-6L [**9-15**] to help
   - OG tube placed for tube feeds
   - started on phenylephrine pressor to maintain BP, likely because of
   increased sedation from intubation procedure,  hopefully can be weaned
   once extra intubation sedation wears off by morning; on midaz and
   fentanyl currently for sedation, did get some propofol during
   intubation procedure

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, and was found to have acute cholecystitis. He underwent cholecystostomy and intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis with encephalopathy, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, history of CAD/CHF, diabetes mellitus type II, and prostate cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function is compromised, and it may worsen due to factors such as sepsis, fluid overload, or nephrotoxic medications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of stroke and can lead to hemodynamic instability if not managed appropriately.

   Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting, RUQ abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   [**9-14**]:
   - ABG (w non-rebreather): 7.33/54/107
   - had been lying on his left side, so much of abdominal fluids probably
   shifted into left pleural cavity; also had received 14L? extra in last
   couple of days
   - didn't respond to lasix 20mg IV, so tried 40mg IV lasix
   - ABG: with non-invasive ventilation BIPAP for 1.5 hrs-- 7.36/52/95
   - switched back to non-rebreather for comfort
   - switched back to Bipap for a couple of hours
   - A-line placed right radial, ABG 21:00 unchanged, pt feels
   subjectively more difficulty breathing-->  INTUBATED at 21:50 by
   anesthesia, placed on AC w tidal volumes 450cc
   -> Intubation done w intention of improving respiratory status to buy
   us more time to get the fluid out of his chest cavity -- thought to be
   positional from belly; will likely tap 5-6L [**9-15**] to help
   - OG tube placed for tube feeds
   - started on phenylephrine pressor to maintain BP, likely because of
   increased sedation from intubation procedure,  hopefully can be weaned
   once extra intubation sedation wears off by morning; on midaz and
   fentanyl currently for sedation, did get some propofol during
   intubation procedure

He has a history of atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and altered mental status possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy. Other conditions include anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor vital signs, white blood cell count, and lactate levels.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function is worsening, which can be attributed to volume depletion, phenylephrine, and possible abdominal compartment syndrome. It is important to maintain adequate intravascular volume, monitor"

   Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting, RUQ abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   [**9-14**]:
   - ABG (w non-rebreather): 7.33/54/107
   - had been lying on his left side, so much of abdominal fluids probably
   shifted into left pleural cavity; also had received 14L? extra in last
   couple of days
   - didn't respond to lasix 20mg IV, so tried 40mg IV lasix
   - ABG: with non-invasive ventilation BIPAP for 1.5 hrs-- 7.36/52/95
   - switched back to non-rebreather for comfort
   - switched back to Bipap for a couple of hours
   - A-line placed right radial, ABG 21:00 unchanged, pt feels
   subjectively more difficulty breathing-->  INTUBATED at 21:50 by
   anesthesia, placed on AC w tidal volumes 450cc
   -> Intubation done w intention of improving respiratory status to buy
   us more time to get the fluid out of his chest cavity -- thought to be
   positional from belly; will likely tap 5-6L [**9-15**] to help
   - OG tube placed for tube feeds
   - started on phenylephrine pressor to maintain BP, likely because of
   increased sedation from intubation procedure,  hopefully can be weaned
   once extra intubation sedation wears off by morning; on midaz and
   fentanyl currently for sedation, did get some propofol during
   intubation procedure

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR today with ?
   atelectasis versus pleural effusions
   -          Esoaphageal balloon study to evaluate pleural pressures.
   -          Pending esophageal balloon study, consider pericentesis
   today to drain ascites as this will help his fluid overload
   -          Consider lasix to decrease pulmonary effusions
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures.  Can d/c cipro
   and vanc given cultures with E. Coli.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data
   - repeat blood culture, send sputum culture and repeat peritoneal
   culture if pericentesis today
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   dark brown.
   -  Continue zosyn and d/c vanc and cipro as above
   -  will check KUB per surgery recs
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  Cr now increasing, likely due to combination
   intravascular volume depletion, phenylephrine, and ? abdominal
   compartment syndrome.  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr.  Will hold
   for now pending results from bladder pressure and esophageal balloon
   study
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - will check bladder pressure to evaluate for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome and consider pericentesis if bladder pressure > 20
   cm H2O
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  D/C nadolol
   now given HR well-controlled and other potential causes for minimal
   tachycardia
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend platelets, coags and LFTs
   - Pericentesis today if elevated bladder/pleural pressure
   - Continue lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   Add Erythromycin for gastric motility.  Goal [**3-16**] BMs today
   - Hold nadolol for now
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood and peritoneal cultures
   - check ammonia
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now
   improving, likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion in
   setting of worse ascites
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor Hcts, especially after procedure.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 108
   - continue to trend
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   ================
   Patient hypotensive post intubation. CVP suggests low intravascular

   weight. Will assess pleural pressure. I think CXR yesterday showed a
   moderate amount of atelectasis in the left lung. This looks better on
   CXR today, but I suspect he may benefit from higher PEEP. Still has
   moderate oxygen requirement.
   Urine output down and creatinine is elevated. Concern about abdominal
   compartment syndrome. Will asssess bladder pressure. [**Month (only) 8**] need
   paracentesis today. Would like to switch vasopressor - phenylephrine
   may further compromise renal perfusion. Patient had brief episode of
   afib several days ago; hence, concern about using an inotropic [**Doctor Last Name **].
   At this time, however, I think the relative [**Name (NI) 9203**] of the beta agonist is
   less than the pure alpha agonist. Will also begin vasopressin.
   Patient with evidence of gram negative bacteremia now. Awaiting final
   results of cultures to determine if this is the same organism as in
   ascites.
   Hct stable. No evidence of acute bleeding. Not at transfusion
   threshold.
   Getting lactulose in setting of cirrhosis and infection to minimize
   enchaphalopathy; high gastric residuals, however, now. Try promotility
   [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Oxygenation okay with FIO2 0.5; will increase PEEP to 12 while waiting
   for pleural pressure measurement. ABG consistent with chronic
   respiratory acidosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including cholecystitis, hypotension, acute renal failure, cirrhosis, chronic respiratory failure, and chronic kidney disease. The patient was intubated due to increased respiratory distress and subsequently experienced a drop in blood pressure requiring vasopressors. The patient also has elevated white blood cell count and evidence of gram-negative bacteremia. There are concerns about abdominal compartment syndrome and the need for paracentesis. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with plans to increase PEEP and measure pleural pressure. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR today with ?
   atelectasis versus pleural effusions
   -          Esoaphageal balloon study to evaluate pleural pressures.
   -          Pending esophageal balloon study, consider pericentesis
   today to drain ascites as this will help his fluid overload
   -          Consider lasix to decrease pulmonary effusions
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures.  Can d/c cipro
   and vanc given cultures with E. Coli.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data
   - repeat blood culture, send sputum culture and repeat peritoneal
   culture if pericentesis today
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   dark brown.
   -  Continue zosyn and d/c vanc and cipro as above
   -  will check KUB per surgery recs
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  Cr now increasing, likely due to combination
   intravascular volume depletion, phenylephrine, and ? abdominal
   compartment syndrome.  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr.  Will hold
   for now pending results from bladder pressure and esophageal balloon
   study
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - will check bladder pressure to evaluate for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome and consider pericentesis if bladder pressure > 20
   cm H2O
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  D/C nadolol
   now given HR well-controlled and other potential causes for minimal
   tachycardia
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend platelets, coags and LFTs

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and acute cholecystitis who is currently in the ICU. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by E. coli, which is susceptible to Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). He also has acute cholecystitis and is being treated with Zosyn. The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, a history of CAD/dCHF, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of further complications related to sepsis due to his elevated white blood cell count and positive cultures for E. coli.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear, but it is increasing, indicating potential worsening of his renal function. This may lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has an uncontrolled ventricular rate, which could potentially"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR yesterday with ?
   atelectasis versus pleural effusions.  Gas good on present vent
   settings, O2 sats 90s.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%.  Continue PEEP of 15.
   - re-check esophageal balloon pressures in PM
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures.  Can d/c cipro
   and vanc given cultures with E. Coli.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data
   - repeat blood culture, send sputum culture and repeat peritoneal
   culture if pericentesis today
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   dark brown.
   -  Continue zosyn and d/c vanc and cipro as above
   -  will check KUB per surgery recs
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  Cr now increasing, likely due to combination
   intravascular volume depletion, phenylephrine, and ? abdominal
   compartment syndrome.  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr.  Will hold
   for now pending results from bladder pressure and esophageal balloon
   study
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - will check bladder pressure to evaluate for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome and consider pericentesis if bladder pressure > 20
   cm H2O
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  D/C nadolol
   now given HR well-controlled and other potential causes for minimal
   tachycardia
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend platelets, coags and LFTs
   - Pericentesis today if elevated bladder/pleural pressure
   - Continue lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   Add Erythromycin for gastric motility.  Goal [**3-16**] BMs today
   - Hold nadolol for now
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood and peritoneal cultures
   - check ammonia
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now
   improving, likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion in
   setting of worse ascites
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor Hcts, especially after procedure.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 108
   - continue to trend
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   Disposition:  ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, prostate cancer, who was admitted with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. The patient's current condition includes sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, acute cholecystitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further complications due to sepsis, which is secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by E. coli infection. Continuous monitoring and management of vital signs, fluid balance, and infection control measures are crucial.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is reported to be 1.2, and there has been an increase in creatinine levels. This indicates potential worsening of renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, and maintenance of appropriate fluid balance are essential.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and subsequently intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis with encephalopathy, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, history of CAD/CHF, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis. It is crucial to continue monitoring his vital signs, blood cultures, and white blood cell count.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to maintain urine output above 30 cc/hr. If there is an increase in creatinine levels or decrease in urine output, reassessment of the abdominal exam and consideration of colloids, pressors, or repeat paracentesis may be necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ventricular rates should be controlled, and he should be monitored for any signs"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR today with ?
   atelectasis versus pleural effusions
   -          Esoaphageal balloon study to evaluate pleural pressures.
   -          Pending esophageal balloon study, consider pericentesis
   today to drain ascites as this will help his fluid overload
   -          Consider lasix to decrease pulmonary effusions
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures.  Can d/c cipro
   and vanc given cultures with E. Coli.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data
   - repeat blood culture, send sputum culture and repeat peritoneal
   culture if pericentesis today
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   dark brown.
   -  Continue zosyn and d/c vanc and cipro as above
   -  will check KUB per surgery recs
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  Cr now increasing, likely due to combination
   intravascular volume depletion, phenylephrine, and ? abdominal
   compartment syndrome.  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr.  Will hold
   for now pending results from bladder pressure and esophageal balloon
   study
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - will check bladder pressure to evaluate for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome and consider pericentesis if bladder pressure > 20
   cm H2O
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  D/C nadolol
   now given HR well-controlled and other potential causes for minimal
   tachycardia
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend platelets, coags and LFTs
   - Pericentesis today if elevated bladder/pleural pressure
   - Continue lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   Add Erythromycin for gastric motility.  Goal [**3-16**] BMs today
   - Hold nadolol for now
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood and peritoneal cultures
   - check ammonia
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient also has sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by E. coli, which is susceptible to Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). He is currently receiving volume resuscitation and antibiotics.

The patient's current conditions include acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), altered mental status possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, history of CAD/dCHF, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 106/53 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is sedated and responsive to commands. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and his abdomen is tense with a positive fluid wave. He has a cholestomy tube draining brown liquid from the right upper quadrant"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR today with ?
   atelectasis versus pleural effusions
   -          Esoaphageal balloon study to evaluate pleural pressures.
   -          Pending esophageal balloon study, consider pericentesis
   today to drain ascites as this will help his fluid overload
   -          Consider lasix to decrease pulmonary effusions
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.
   - Volume resuscitation with goal UOP 30 cc/hr and MAPs > 65 and CVP
   12-14 goal
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures.  Can d/c cipro
   and vanc given cultures with E. Coli.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data
   - repeat blood culture, send sputum culture and repeat peritoneal
   culture if pericentesis today
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   dark brown.
   -  Continue zosyn and d/c vanc and cipro as above
   -  will check KUB per surgery recs
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr is
   reportedly at his baseline of 1.2 (however in OMR in [**2180**] he had a
   normal Cr of 0.8).  Cr now increasing, likely due to combination
   intravascular volume depletion, phenylephrine, and ? abdominal
   compartment syndrome.  K was initially high, but has normalized. FeUrea
   was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - IVFs to maintain appropriate MAPS > 65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr.  Will hold
   for now pending results from bladder pressure and esophageal balloon
   study
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - will check bladder pressure to evaluate for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome and consider pericentesis if bladder pressure > 20
   cm H2O
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates in upper 90s and lower 100s
   overnight, but more controlled now.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  D/C nadolol
   now given HR well-controlled and other potential causes for minimal
   tachycardia
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend platelets, coags and LFTs
   - Pericentesis today if elevated bladder/pleural pressure
   - Continue lactulose for treatment of likely hepatic encephalopathy.
   Add Erythromycin for gastric motility.  Goal [**3-16**] BMs today
   - Hold nadolol for now
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.
   - Clarify baseline with family .
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood and peritoneal cultures
   - check ammonia
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now
   improving, likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion in
   setting of worse ascites
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor Hcts, especially after procedure.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 108
   - continue to trend
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.  Patient appears volume depleted on exam.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   - Will consider a TTE to assess cardiac function if he hasn't had a
   recent one at [**Hospital3 2851**].
   #  DMII:
   - While NPO will give [**12-13**] his regular home insulin regimen.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute cholecystitis, sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient had a pleural pressure of 12/0 inspiration/end-expiration, which was corrected by increasing PEEP to 15.
- Bladder pressure was measured at 21 mmHg and then decreased to 19 mmHg after tapping to assess for abdominal compartment syndrome.
- Sputum cultures were sent, possibly for aspiration pneumonia.
- Antibiotics were discontinued and replaced with e. coli-specific therapy.
- Therapeutic paracentesis was performed, removing 4 liters of amber fluid, and albumin was administered afterward.
- Kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) examination was done, but it was non-diagnostic due to the presence of ascites.
- The patient was taken off nadolol, a beta-blocker used for hypertension and heart rate control.
- Vasopressor support was changed from phenylephrine to levo/vaso.
- The patient received a 1-liter normal saline bolus after tapping.
- Esophageal balloon study showed"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Patient had removal of 4L of ascitic fluid yesterday. Bladder pressure
   down slightly - now 19; albumin given at the same time. Urine output
   has been greater than 30 cc/hr since removal of ascitic fluid. Creat
   improved this AM.
   Continues on vasopressin; levophed stopped about an hour ago. CVP still
   less than 10.
   Pleural pressure still appears to be 15 this morning. Oxygenation a bit
   better on higher PEEP.

   ==============================
   Some encouraging signs in the past 24 hours: urine output increased and
   creat down with tap of ascites and administration of albumin; BP and
   oxygenation somewhat improved. This suggests he he had functional
   abdominal compartment syndrome even though the bladder pressure was
   marginal for that dx.  Continue to support with volume resuscitation as
   needed to keep UO greater than 30 cc/hr. Now off levophed. Continue
   vasopressin for another 24 hours.  O2 saturation a bit better since
   PEEP increased yesterday to match pleural pressure. Ppl still being
   measured at approximately 15. Will try to reduce FIO2 to 0.4 today. CVP
   remains low; hesitant to give more fluid than necessary to sustain UO
   given his low albumin and portal hypertension.
   Hct down slightly; not at transfusion threshold - no evidence of acute
   bleeding; monitor stool guaiac. Platelets low; not at transfusion
   threshold now.
   Continues on antibiotics. E coli growing from bile and ascites.
   Continue lactulose via OG tube. INR mildly prolonged.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, cirrhosis, cholecystitis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient had removal of 4L of ascitic fluid yesterday, which led to an improvement in urine output and creatinine levels. The patient is still on vasopressin and oxygenation is slightly better on higher PEEP.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. Some of these complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in lung function. The patient may require mechanical ventilation support.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute renal failure, which could progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly. This may require dialysis or other forms of renal replacement therapy.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, indicating poor blood pressure control. This could be due to sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or volume depletion. Continuous monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation or vasopressor therapy may be necessary.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis of the liver, which increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome. Monitoring liver function and managing complications such as portal hypertension and ascites is crucial.

5. Cholecystitis: The patient has cholecystitis,"

   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR shows improved
   inflation of lungs, still with L pleural effusion.  Gas good on present
   vent settings, O2 sats 90s.
   - wean FIO2 to 50%.  Continue PEEP of 15.
   - re-check esophageal balloon pressures in PM.  Wean PEEP as tolerated,
   though unlikely given large chest wall.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.  WBC trending down.
   Afebrile.  Sputum gram stain now with GPC in pairs and clusters,
   awaiting cultures and speciation
   - Volume resuscitation difficult given liver failure and ascites
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures. d/c
d cipro and
   vanc and continued zosyn given cultures with E. Coli.  Will now
   re-start Vanc pending culture speciation and sensitivities
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid, blood and sputum cultures)
   - levophed d/c
d on [**9-16**].  Continue vasopressin and consider d/c trial
   tomorrow.
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  KUB was done and was
   non-diagnostic.  No apparent abdominal pain.
   -  Continue zosyn and re-start Vanc as above.
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p
   tap + fluid bolus with albumin.  Now stable.  K was initially high, but
   has normalized. FeUrea was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic
   picture
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - if Cr increase or u/o decrease, reassess abdominal exam, bladder
   pressure and consider colloids, pressors, or repeat paracentesis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates 60s to 80s.  No signs of
   hemodynamic instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  Continue to
   hold nadolol now given HR well-controlled
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.  AST/ALT
   trending down slightly, T. bili increasing slightly, ascites improved.
   Massive diarrhea on lactulose and erythromycin requiring flexiseal
   placement.  Erythromycin d/c
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 42 from 45
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, now
   high 300s-400 with tube feeds.  Standing insulin increased from 20
   yesterday.  Received 20 units glargine per sliding scale.
   - increase standing dose to 36 from 24, change to [**Hospital1 **] dosing with NPH
   18/18.
   - continue insulin SS.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   - nutrition consult to consider changing tube feeds
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent cholecystostomy for acute cholecystitis and intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on ventilatory support with PRVC/AC mode. FiO2 is being weaned down to 50% and PEEP is set at 15 cmH2O.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by E. coli, which was initially resistant to ciprofloxacin but susceptible to zosyn. The patient is being treated with zosyn and vancomycin.
3. Acute Cholecystitis: The patient had cholecystitis and underwent cholecystostomy. Output from the cholecystostomy tube has been yellow to brown and consistent.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline renal function is unclear, but creatinine levels were increasing due to volume depletion, phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome. Now stable, the patient is being closely monitored for changes in creatinine and urine output.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has ventricular rates in the 60s to 80s without signs of hemodynamic instability.
6. Cirrhosis: The patient has known cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose. He also has synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had changes in mental status, possibly secondary to sepsis or hepatic encephalopathy.
8. Anemia: The patient had an acute drop in hemoglobin likely due to fluid resuscitation.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low but stable.
10. History of Coronary Artery Disease/ Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's EKG was without ischemic changes, and there is no active chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. hepatic encephalopathy
3. acute kidney injury
4. gastrointestinal bleeding
5. deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
6. stress ulcers
7. hypoglycemia
8. infections (due to immunocompromised state)
9. further deterioration of renal function
10. cardiac events

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR shows improved
   inflation of lungs, still with L pleural effusion.  Gas good on present
   vent settings, O2 sats 90s.
   - wean FIO2 to 50%.  Continue PEEP of 15.
   - re-check esophageal balloon pressures in PM.  Wean PEEP as tolerated,
   though unlikely given large chest wall.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.  WBC trending down.
   Afebrile.  Sputum gram stain now with GPC in pairs and clusters,
   awaiting cultures and speciation
   - Volume resuscitation difficult given liver failure and ascites
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures. d/c
d cipro and
   vanc and continued zosyn given cultures with E. Coli.  Will now
   re-start Vanc pending culture speciation and sensitivities
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid, blood and sputum cultures)
   - levophed d/c
d on [**9-16**].  Continue vasopressin and consider d/c trial
   tomorrow.
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  KUB was done and was
   non-diagnostic.  No apparent abdominal pain.
   -  Continue zosyn and re-start Vanc as above.
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p
   tap + fluid bolus with albumin.  Now stable.  K was initially high, but
   has normalized. FeUrea was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic
   picture
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - if Cr increase or u/o decrease, reassess abdominal exam, bladder
   pressure and consider colloids, pressors, or repeat paracentesis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates 60s to 80s.  No signs of
   hemodynamic instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  Continue to
   hold nadolol now given HR well-controlled
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.  AST/ALT
   trending down slightly, T. bili increasing slightly, ascites improved.
   Massive diarrhea on lactulose and erythromycin requiring flexiseal
   placement.  Erythromycin d/c
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 42 from 45
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, now
   high 300s-400 with tube feeds.  Standing insulin increased from 20
   yesterday.  Received 20 units glargine per sliding scale.
   - increase standing dose to 36 from 24, change to [**Hospital1 **] dosing with NPH
   18/18.
   - continue insulin SS.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   - nutrition consult to consider changing tube feeds
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   [**Name2 (NI) 156**] status: Full code for now (per daughter, HCP)
   Disposition:  ICU
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by E. coli, which was initially resistant to ciprofloxacin but susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's respiratory status has been complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. He also has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and a history of CAD/CHF.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 128/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 60% FiO2. He is sedated and minimally responsive to commands. Physical examination findings include sclera anicteric, regular heart rhythm with no murmurs, good air movement throughout the lungs, positive fluid wave in the abdomen, and warm well-perfused extremities.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, increased blood glucose levels, elevated"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and acute cholecystitis. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis due to E. coli infection. The patient underwent cholecystostomy and intubation. His condition has been complicated by liver failure, ascites, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial admission to the ICU was for hypoxic respiratory failure, which required intubation. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by E. coli infection. It is crucial to monitor vital signs, laboratory values, and response to antibiotic therapy. Frequent assessment of fluid balance and hemodynamic status is essential.
3. Liver failure and ascites: The patient's liver failure has led to the development of ascites. Monitoring abdominal examination for"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR yesterday with ?
   atelectasis versus pleural effusions.  Gas good on present vent
   settings, O2 sats 90s.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%.  Continue PEEP of 15.
   - re-check esophageal balloon pressures in PM.  Wean PEEP as tolerated.
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.  WBC trending down.
   Afebrile.
   - Volume resuscitation difficult given liver failure and ascites
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures.  Can d/c cipro
   and vanc and continue zosyn given cultures with E. Coli.
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid and blood cultures)
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   dark brown.  More fluid with less clots/sludge today.  KUB
   non-diagnostic.  Pain decreasing.
   -  Continue zosyn and d/c vanc and cipro as above
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr now trending
   down s/p tap + fluid bolus with albumin.  K was initially high, but has
   normalized. FeUrea was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - if Cr increase or u/o decrease, reassess abdominal exam, bladder
   pressure and consider colloids, pressors, or repeat paracentesis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates 60s to 80s.  No signs of
   hemodynamic instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  Continue to
   hold nadolol now given HR well-controlled
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.  AST/ALT
   trending down slightly, T. bili increasing slightly, ascites improved.
   Massive diarrhea on lactulose and erythromycin yesterday requiring
   flexiseal placement.
   - d/c erythromycin
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood and peritoneal cultures.  Continue treatment for
   underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 45 from 108
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, now
   high 200s with tube feeds.  Received 6 units glargine per sliding
   scale.
   - increase standing dose to 24 from 20.
   - continue insulin SS.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He was admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by E. coli, hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a history of CAD/CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, as evidenced by the presence of E. coli in the peritoneal fluid. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and lactate levels is essential to detect any signs of deterioration.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Given the patient's history of chronic renal insufficiency and current signs of hepatorenal syndrome, there is a risk of developing AKI. Monitoring serum creatinine levels, urine output, and electrolyte imbalances will help in early detection and management of AKI.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR yesterday showed
   improved inflation of lungs, still with L pleural effusion.  Gas good
   on present vent settings, O2 sats 90s.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%.  Continue PEEP of 15.
   - re-check esophageal balloon pressures in PM.  Wean PEEP as tolerated,
   though unlikely given large chest wall.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - will repeat paracentesis today with goal 4-5 L removal
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.  Sputum gram stain now with
   GPC in pairs and clusters, growing GNR in culture.  GNR from repeat
   peritoneal tap showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  WBC stable.
   Fever to 101 this AM.
   - Volume resuscitation difficult given liver failure and ascites
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures. d/c
d cipro and
   vanc and continued zosyn given cultures with E. Coli.  Will now
   re-start Vanc pending culture speciation and sensitivities.
   - D/C zosyn and start meropenem given intermediate sensitivity to zosyn
   - Will trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid, blood and sputum cultures)
   - levophed d/c
d on [**9-16**].  Vasopressin d/c
d [**9-18**].
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  No apparent abdominal pain.
   Drainage around tube, IR consulted
 US done, non-diagnostic due to
   cannot visualize gall bladder.
   -  Continue zosyn and re-start Vanc as above.
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   - paracentesis today may relieve pressure and reduce drainage around
   tube per IR.  Tube most likely in place given continued bilious
   drainage.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p
   tap + fluid bolus with albumin.  Now stable.  K was initially high, but
   has normalized. FeUrea was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic
   picture
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - Repeat paracentesis, goal 4-5 L removal
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates > 100-120.  No signs of
   hemodynamic instability.  Tachycardia can be due to fever, acute
   illness, or a-fib with RVR.
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  Holding
   nadolol now.  Will consider restarting if HR persistently >110.
   - monitor HR in context of paracentesis, abx and hopefully reduction in
   fever
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.  AST/ALT
   trending down slightly, T. bili increasing slightly, ascites improved.
   Massive diarrhea on lactulose and erythromycin requiring flexiseal
   placement.  Erythromycin d/c
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   - repeat paracentesis
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 49 from 42
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, now
   high 300s-400 with tube feeds.  Insulin drip started to better titrate
   insulin requirements.  Nutrition consulted and will not change feeds
   given hypoglycemic formula requires more fluid.
   - continue insulin drip and calculate 24 hour needs once stable
   - plan to transition to NPH tomorrow
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR shows improved
   inflation of lungs, still with L pleural effusion.  Gas good on present
   vent settings, O2 sats 90s.
   - wean FIO2 to 50%.  Continue PEEP of 15.
   - re-check esophageal balloon pressures in PM.  Wean PEEP as tolerated,
   though unlikely given large chest wall.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.  WBC trending down.
   Afebrile.  Sputum gram stain now with GPC in pairs and clusters,
   awaiting cultures and speciation
   - Volume resuscitation difficult given liver failure and ascites
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures. d/c
d cipro and
   vanc and continued zosyn given cultures with E. Coli.  Will now
   re-start Vanc pending culture speciation and sensitivities
   - Will trend WBC and lactate.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid, blood and sputum cultures)
   - levophed d/c
d on [**9-16**].  Continue vasopressin and consider d/c trial
   tomorrow.
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  KUB was done and was
   non-diagnostic.  No apparent abdominal pain.
   -  Continue zosyn and re-start Vanc as above.
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p
   tap + fluid bolus with albumin.  Now stable.  K was initially high, but
   has normalized. FeUrea was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic
   picture
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - if Cr increase or u/o decrease, reassess abdominal exam, bladder
   pressure and consider colloids, pressors, or repeat paracentesis
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates 60s to 80s.  No signs of
   hemodynamic instability
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  Continue to
   hold nadolol now given HR well-controlled
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.  AST/ALT
   trending down slightly, T. bili increasing slightly, ascites improved.
   Massive diarrhea on lactulose and erythromycin requiring flexiseal
   placement.  Erythromycin d/c
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 42 from 45
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, now
   high 300s-400 with tube feeds.  Standing insulin increased from 20
   yesterday.  Received 20 units glargine per sliding scale.
   - increase standing dose to 36 from 24, change to [**Hospital1 **] dosing with NPH
   18/18.
   - continue insulin SS.
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   - nutrition consult to consider changing tube feeds
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy and intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR yesterday showed
   improved inflation of lungs, still with L pleural effusion.  Gas good
   on present vent settings, O2 sats 90s.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%.  Continue PEEP of 15.
   - re-check esophageal balloon pressures in PM.  Wean PEEP as tolerated,
   though unlikely given large chest wall.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - will repeat paracentesis today with goal 4-5 L removal
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.  Sputum gram stain now with
   GPC in pairs and clusters, growing GNR in culture.  GNR from repeat
   peritoneal tap showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  WBC stable.
   Fever to 101 this AM.
   - Volume resuscitation difficult given liver failure and ascites
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures. d/c
d cipro and
   vanc and continued zosyn given cultures with E. Coli.  Will now
   re-start Vanc pending culture speciation and sensitivities.
   - D/C zosyn and start meropenem given intermediate sensitivity to zosyn
   - Will trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid, blood and sputum cultures)
   - levophed d/c
d on [**9-16**].  Vasopressin d/c
d [**9-18**].
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  No apparent abdominal pain.
   Drainage around tube, IR consulted
 US done, non-diagnostic due to
   cannot visualize gall bladder.
   -  Continue zosyn and re-start Vanc as above.
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   - paracentesis today may relieve pressure and reduce drainage around
   tube per IR.  Tube most likely in place given continued bilious
   drainage.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p
   tap + fluid bolus with albumin.  Now stable.  K was initially high, but
   has normalized. FeUrea was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic
   picture
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - Repeat paracentesis, goal 4-5 L removal
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates > 100-120.  No signs of
   hemodynamic instability.  Tachycardia can be due to fever, acute
   illness, or a-fib with RVR.
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  Holding
   nadolol now.  Will consider restarting if HR persistently >110.
   - monitor HR in context of paracentesis, abx and hopefully reduction in
   fever
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.  AST/ALT
   trending down slightly, T. bili increasing slightly, ascites improved.
   Massive diarrhea on lactulose and erythromycin requiring flexiseal
   placement.  Erythromycin d/c
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   - repeat paracentesis
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 49 from 42
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, now
   high 300s-400 with tube feeds.  Insulin drip started to better titrate
   insulin requirements.  Nutrition consulted and will not change feeds
   given hypoglycemic formula requires more fluid.
   - continue insulin drip and calculate 24 hour needs once stable
   - plan to transition to NPH tomorrow
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and respiratory failure. The patient underwent cholecystostomy and intubation. He is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, history of CAD/CHF, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation or if underlying conditions such as sepsis progress.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of further deterioration due to sepsis caused by bacterial peritonitis. Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and response to antibiotics is crucial.
3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, leading to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremia.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm disorder may progress, resulting in complications like embolic events, heart"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. They have respiratory failure, cirrhosis of the liver, anemia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, and cholecystitis. The patient's oxygenation is improving, but they still require respiratory support. Hemodynamics are better, and the patient is off vasopressors. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance, and a paracentesis will be performed today with administration of albumin. The patient has developed E. coli in their ascitic fluid, which is becoming resistant to Zosyn, so a switch to meropenem is planned. The patient's hematocrit and platelet count are stable and do not require transfusion. An insulin infusion will continue for better glucose control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation support. This condition can lead to further lung complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient has cirrhosis, which can lead to complications like hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, increasing the risk of bleeding complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, E. Coli sepsis,
   respiratory failure s/p intubation.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  Gas OK on present
   vent settings with decreased FiO2 to 40%, O2 sats 90s.
   - continue FIO2 at 40%.  Continue PEEP of 15.  lost esophageal balloon
   yesterday.
   - re-check ABG in afternoon.  If looks ok, can start to wean PEEP to
   13.
   - no need to replace esophageal balloon at this point.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro, however subsequent
   culture showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  Abx changed to
   meropenem.  Sputum gram stain with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters,
   growing GNR in culture.  Blood cultures negative to date.  Spiked fever
   to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday morning prior to change in abx, spiked fever overnight
   to 102 < 24 hours on meropenem.
   - Continue meropenem, vanc.
   - send blood, urine for g-stain and culture.
   - send stool for C. dif
   - send sputum if adequate secretions for g-stain and culture.
   - Will trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid from [**9-18**], blood, urine, and
   sputum cultures)
   - levophed d/c
d on [**9-16**].  Vasopressin d/c
d [**9-18**].
   - check CXR, consider chest/abdomen CT if continues to be febrile in
   PM.
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  No apparent abdominal pain.
   Drainage around tube, IR consulted
 US done, non-diagnostic due to
   cannot visualize gall bladder.
   -  Continue abx as above
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   - re-check cholecystostomy tube s/p paracentesis, change dressings
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Initially, FeUrea was 5.7%
   c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p
   tap + fluid bolus with albumin, stable now s/p repeat paracentesis.  K
   was initially high, but has normalized.  BUN increasing out of
   proportion to stable Cr, now > 100.
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - nutrition c/s to consider changing to a lower protein diet
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia:  Ventricular rates > 120, up to 145
   overnight.  Given metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3 with HR down to 125, SBP down
   to 90s.  HR climbed back to 120s-130s. Amiodarone 5 mg drip started
   with no effect.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary
   arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone for now.
   - infectious workup as above.  Will follow HR relative to fever curve
   - 500 ml fluid bolus.  If responsive (HR < 110), will consider further
   fluid bolus recognizing that administration of fluids in this patient
   who readily 3^rd-spaces is potentially problem[**Name (NI) 555**].
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR, stable now.
   AST/ALT trending down slightly, T. bili increasing consistently, direct
   bili 5.4, ascites improved.  Massive diarrhea on lactulose and
   erythromycin requiring flexiseal placement.
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   - repeat paracentesis
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 39 from 49
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, high
   300s-400 with tube feeds, started on insulin drip requiring 270 units /
   24 hours.  Lipase checked and normal (17).  Nutrition consulted and was
   reluctant to change feeds given hypoglycemic formula requires more
   fluid.  Likely etiology of high sugars is resistant infection.
   - continue insulin drip and re-calculate 24 hour needs
   - plan to transition to NPH if reasonable
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   on:[**2183-9-19**] 12:42 ------
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, which was initially caused by gram-negative rods (GNR) later identified as E. coli. He required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing sepsis with a fever spike to 102°F overnight, persistent tachycardia, and increased blood lactate levels. His renal function has improved after a tap with albumin infusion but remains compromised. He also has altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, insulin, vasopressors, and supportive care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to organ failure, further deterioration in renal function, development of hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and potential coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the information provided, the patient's condition is critical and requires close monitoring and management of the identified complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, E. Coli sepsis,
   respiratory failure s/p intubation.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  CXR yesterday showed
   improved inflation of lungs, still with L pleural effusion.  Gas good
   on present vent settings, O2 sats 90s.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%.  Continue PEEP of 15.
   - re-check esophageal balloon pressures in PM.  Wean PEEP as tolerated,
   though unlikely given large chest wall.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - will repeat paracentesis today with goal 4-5 L removal
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro.  Sputum gram stain now with
   GPC in pairs and clusters, growing GNR in culture.  GNR from repeat
   peritoneal tap showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  WBC stable.
   Fever to 101 this AM.
   - Volume resuscitation difficult given liver failure and ascites
   - Was started on vanc, zosyn, cipro pending cultures. d/c
d cipro and
   vanc and continued zosyn given cultures with E. Coli.  Will now
   re-start Vanc pending culture speciation and sensitivities.
   - D/C zosyn and start meropenem given intermediate sensitivity to zosyn
   - Will trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid, blood and sputum cultures)
   - levophed d/c
d on [**9-16**].  Vasopressin d/c
d [**9-18**].
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  No apparent abdominal pain.
   Drainage around tube, IR consulted
 US done, non-diagnostic due to
   cannot visualize gall bladder.
   -  Continue zosyn and re-start Vanc as above.
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   - paracentesis today may relieve pressure and reduce drainage around
   tube per IR.  Tube most likely in place given continued bilious
   drainage.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p
   tap + fluid bolus with albumin.  Now stable.  K was initially high, but
   has normalized. FeUrea was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic
   picture
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - Repeat paracentesis, goal 4-5 L removal
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Ventricular rates > 100-120.  No signs of
   hemodynamic instability.  Tachycardia can be due to fever, acute
   illness, or a-fib with RVR.
   - restarted home nadolol though not used for BP and HR.  Holding
   nadolol now.  Will consider restarting if HR persistently >110.
   - monitor HR in context of paracentesis, abx and hopefully reduction in
   fever
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR.  AST/ALT
   trending down slightly, T. bili increasing slightly, ascites improved.
   Massive diarrhea on lactulose and erythromycin requiring flexiseal
   placement.  Erythromycin d/c
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   - repeat paracentesis
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 49 from 42
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, now
   high 300s-400 with tube feeds.  Insulin drip started to better titrate
   insulin requirements.  Nutrition consulted and will not change feeds
   given hypoglycemic formula requires more fluid.
   - continue insulin drip and calculate 24 hour needs once stable
   - plan to transition to NPH tomorrow
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   Disposition:  ICU
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He presented with acute cholecystitis and was subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis with encephalopathy, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 99/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates over 100-120 beats per minute.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, increased liver enzymes, low hemoglobin, and decreased platelet count. The blood culture shows growth of Gram-negative rods, which are sensitive to Zosyn but intermediate to meropenem. The urine output is low, and the patient has a significant fluid balance deficit.

The patient's past medical history includes a cholecystostomy for acute cholecystitis, and there is ongoing drainage around the tube"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, which was initially suspected to be caused by E. coli but later identified as GNR. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and his blood glucose levels have been high while on tube feeds. He also has thrombocytopenia and anemia. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and he has evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR. He has hepatic encephalopathy and is on lactulose. He has a history of altered mental status, possibly secondary to sepsis, and his ammonia level is 58. He has a history of CAD and CHF but currently does not have any active chest pain.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of acute cholecystitis progressed to sepsis, indicating a severe systemic infection response. It is crucial to continue aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics, source control, and supportive care.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure"

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of chronic heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, prostate cancer, and acute cholecystitis. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by E. coli. He also has respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently being treated for various conditions including sepsis, acute cholecystitis, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type II, and prostate cancer. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 99/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and serum creatinine levels. He has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, insulin, and others. The patient's physical examination is significant for low blood pressure and tachycardia. The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and he is currently in the ICU.

   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, E. Coli sepsis,
   respiratory failure s/p intubation.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  Gas OK on present
   vent settings with decreased FiO2 to 40%, O2 sats 90s.
   - continue FIO2 at 40%.  Continue PEEP of 15.  lost esophageal balloon
   yesterday.
   - re-check ABG in afternoon.  If looks ok, can start to wean PEEP to
   13.
   - no need to replace esophageal balloon at this point.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro, however subsequent
   culture showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  Abx changed to
   meropenem.  Sputum gram stain with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters,
   growing GNR in culture.  Blood cultures negative to date.  Spiked fever
   to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday morning prior to change in abx, spiked fever overnight
   to 102 < 24 hours on meropenem.
   - Continue meropenem, vanc.
   - send blood, urine for g-stain and culture.
   - send stool for C. dif
   - send sputum if adequate secretions for g-stain and culture.
   - Will trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid from [**9-18**], blood, urine, and
   sputum cultures)
   - levophed d/c
d on [**9-16**].  Vasopressin d/c
d [**9-18**].
   - check CXR, consider chest/abdomen CT if continues to be febrile in
   PM.
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  No apparent abdominal pain.
   Drainage around tube, IR consulted
 US done, non-diagnostic due to
   cannot visualize gall bladder.
   -  Continue abx as above
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   - re-check cholecystostomy tube s/p paracentesis, change dressings
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Initially, FeUrea was 5.7%
   c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p
   tap + fluid bolus with albumin, stable now s/p repeat paracentesis.  K
   was initially high, but has normalized.  BUN increasing out of
   proportion to stable Cr, now > 100.
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - nutrition c/s to consider changing to a lower protein diet
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia:  Ventricular rates > 120, up to 145
   overnight.  Given metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3 with HR down to 125, SBP down
   to 90s.  HR climbed back to 120s-130s. Amiodarone 5 mg drip started
   with no effect.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary
   arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone for now.
   - infectious workup as above.  Will follow HR relative to fever curve
   - 500 ml fluid bolus.  If responsive (HR < 110), will consider further
   fluid bolus recognizing that administration of fluids in this patient
   who readily 3^rd-spaces is potentially problem[**Name (NI) 555**].
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR, stable now.
   AST/ALT trending down slightly, T. bili increasing consistently, direct
   bili 5.4, ascites improved.  Massive diarrhea on lactulose and
   erythromycin requiring flexiseal placement.
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   - repeat paracentesis
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 39 from 49
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, high
   300s-400 with tube feeds, started on insulin drip requiring 270 units /
   24 hours.  Lipase checked and normal (17).  Nutrition consulted and was
   reluctant to change feeds given hypoglycemic formula requires more
   fluid.  Likely etiology of high sugars is resistant infection.
   - continue insulin drip and re-calculate 24 hour needs
   - plan to transition to NPH if reasonable
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, and prostate cancer. He presented with acute cholecystitis, E. coli sepsis, and respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has had episodes of hypoxia and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially had E. coli sepsis, which has been treated with various antibiotics. Continued monitoring of vital signs, fever curve, and infection parameters (WBC, CRP) is important to assess response to treatment and detect any new infections.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is concern for acute exacerbation due to sepsis, intravascular volume depletion, and abdominal compartment syndrome. Monitoring of creatinine, BUN, and urine output is essential to manage fluid balance and avoid further renal deterioration.

4. Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing rapid ventricular rates, likely secondary to atrial fibrillation or another primary arrhythmia. Management includes medication adjustment and careful"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, E. Coli sepsis,
   respiratory failure s/p intubation.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  Gas OK on present
   vent settings with decreased FiO2 to 40%, O2 sats 90s.
   - continue FIO2 at 40%.  Continue PEEP of 15.  lost esophageal balloon
   yesterday.
   - re-check ABG in afternoon.  If looks ok, can start to wean PEEP to
   13.
   - no need to replace esophageal balloon at this point.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro, however subsequent
   culture showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  Abx changed to
   meropenem.  Sputum gram stain with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters,
   growing GNR in culture.  Blood cultures negative to date.  Spiked fever
   to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday morning prior to change in abx, spiked fever overnight
   to 102 < 24 hours on meropenem.
   - Continue meropenem, vanc.
   - send blood, urine for g-stain and culture.
   - send stool for C. dif
   - send sputum if adequate secretions for g-stain and culture.
   - Will trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid from [**9-18**], blood, urine, and
   sputum cultures)
   - levophed d/c
d on [**9-16**].  Vasopressin d/c
d [**9-18**].
   - check CXR, consider chest/abdomen CT if continues to be febrile in
   PM.
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  No apparent abdominal pain.
   Drainage around tube, IR consulted
 US done, non-diagnostic due to
   cannot visualize gall bladder.
   -  Continue abx as above
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   - re-check cholecystostomy tube s/p paracentesis, change dressings
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:  Initially, FeUrea was 5.7%
   c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture Unclear baseline; Cr was
   increasing, likely due to combination intravascular volume depletion,
   phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p
   tap + fluid bolus with albumin, stable now s/p repeat paracentesis.  K
   was initially high, but has normalized.
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia:  Ventricular rates > 120, up to 145
   overnight.  Given metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3 with HR down to 125, SBP down
   to 90s.  HR climbed back to 120s-130s. Amiodarone 5 mg drip started
   with no effect.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary
   arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone for now.
   - infectious workup as above.  Will follow HR relative to fever curve
   - 500 ml fluid bolus.  If responsive (HR < 110), will consider further
   fluid bolus recognizing that administration of fluids in this patient
   who readily 3^rd-spaces is potentially problem[**Name (NI) 555**].
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR, stable now.
   AST/ALT trending down slightly, T. bili increasing consistently, direct
   bili 5.4, ascites improved.  Massive diarrhea on lactulose and
   erythromycin requiring flexiseal placement.
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - Holding aldactone for now
   - repeat paracentesis
   #  Altered mental status:  Family had noted initial change in mental
   status, possibly secondary to sepsis.  On exam here he was oriented,
   but unknown baseline.  Likely has some hepatic encephalopathy,
   particularly because not having bowel movements, and he is dependent on
   lactulose at home.  Pt oriented currently but somewhat somnolent.
   Somnolence may also be due to hypercarbia.  Ammonia 58.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia: Acute drop likely in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
   Patient at high risk for bleeding. DIC labs negative. HCT now stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 39 from 49
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:  EKG was without ischemic changes.  No active chest
   pain currently.
   - Not on CAD/CHF regimen as an outpatient.  Will consider starting
   outpatient regimen once present clinical picture improves.
   #  DMII:  FS well-controlled on
 home insulin regimen while NPO, high
   300s-400 with tube feeds, started on insulin drip requiring 270 units /
   24 hours.  Lipase checked and normal (17).  Nutrition consulted and was
   reluctant to change feeds given hypoglycemic formula requires more
   fluid.  Likely etiology of high sugars is resistant infection.
   - continue insulin drip and calculate 24 hour needs
   - plan to transition to NPH if reasonable
   - Monitor with qid finger sticks.
   #  Prostate cancer: Stable. On hormonal therapy as an outpatient.
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   Disposition:  ICU
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He presented with acute cholecystitis and underwent cholecystostomy. He was found to have E. coli sepsis and respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis due to cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation/tachycardia, cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), altered mental status possibly secondary to sepsis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, history of CAD/dCHF, diabetes mellitus type II, prostate cancer, and hypothyroidism.

The patient is receiving various treatments including antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin), vasopressors (phenylephrine and levophed), diuretics (Lasix), insulin, metoprolol, amiodarone, lactulose, proton pump inhibitors (PPI), and stress ulcer prophylaxis. He is also on hormonal therapy for prostate cancer and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit,"

   PEEP to 13.
   Hemodynamics have been stable with good urine output, which is
   encouraging. However, patient has persistent fever now and WBC up
   mildly. [**Month (only) 8**] be related to the fact that the bacteria was only
   intermittently sensitive to Zosyn. Was changed to meropenem yesterday.
   Has diarrhea on lactulose; check for C. Diff. Lines look good. Would
   get additional blood cultures.
   Continues on lactulose for his cirrhosis. Renal function is stable
   although BUN rising. [**Month (only) 8**] be related to catabolic state with low GFR.
   General perfusion is improved; urine output good.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and chronic respiratory failure. The acute respiratory failure may be due to various factors such as pneumonia or sepsis. The chronic respiratory failure could be a result of underlying lung disease or long-term respiratory compromise.

2. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver. This condition can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.

3. Cholecystitis: The patient has calculous cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder caused by gallstones. This condition can cause severe abdominal pain and can lead to complications like gallbladder rupture or infection.

4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has low levels of hemoglobin (anemia) and platelets (thrombocytopenia). Anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding.

5. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which means the kidneys are not functioning properly. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased toxins in the blood, and complications like uremia.

6. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which"

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2183-9-20**] 01:02 AM
   rate appeared in sinus rhythm with questionable pwaves. 12 lead ekg
   revealed afib.
   - A.Fib with RVR o/n, lopressor IV x3 decreased HR but dropped SBP to
   70s
   - Amio loaded and now on infusion, infusion continued o/n b/c patient
   remained tachycardic, repeat EKG showed pt was in A. flutter so less
   likely to break, also pt became hypotensive with decreased HR
   - tried 500cc fluid bolus, but no decrease in HR, tried lasix b/c
   unsure if patient is possibly in heart failure, has pulmonary edema on
   CXR, gave 40mg IV-->put out 60cc's, gave 80mg IV--> unclear urine
   output b/c had leaked around foley site
   - continued fever, currently attributing it to less than 24 hours on
   meropenem, but may need repeat imaging
   - continues on insulin gtt--> difficult to assess 24 hours insulin
   needs, insulin requirement has decreased, looks like the pump may not
   have been working properly and since that change, needs have decreased
   from 24units per hour to 4units per hour
   - Pt. with decreased urine output overnight, inspite of lasix, but
   renal function improving, his foley was leaking onto the bed.
   - Had a few episodes of desaturation, FiO2 increased back to 50%

   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro, however subsequent
   culture showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  Abx changed to
   meropenem.  Sputum gram stain with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters,
   growing GNR in culture.  Blood cultures negative to date.  In last 24
   hours, has spiked to 100.1 while on meropenem.  Not on pressors
   - Continue meropenem, vanc.
   - Chest and Abd CT if pt stable enough to go to radiology
   - f/u blood, urine for g-stain and culture. - f/u stool for C. dif
   - send sputum if adequate secretions for g-stain and culture.

   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid from [**9-18**], blood, urine, and
   sputum cultures)
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  IR was asked about drainage around
   tube insertion site two days ago
 US done, non-diagnostic due to

   if it
s still in place
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Cr improved to 1.2 today.
   Initially, FeUrea was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   Unclear baseline; Cr was increasing, likely due to combination
   intravascular volume depletion, phenylephrine, and abdominal
   compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p tap + fluid bolus with
   albumin, stable now s/p repeat paracentesis.  K was initially high, but
   has normalized.  BUN increasing out of proportion to stable Cr, now >
   100.
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia:  Ventricular rates > 120, up to 145
   overnight.  Given metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3 with HR down to 125, SBP down
   to 90s.  HR climbed back to 120s-130s. Amiodarone 5 mg drip started
   with no effect.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary
   arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone for now
 try to transition to PO amiodarone
   - infectious workup as above.  Will follow HR relative to fever curve
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.2.
   AST/ALT stable, T. bili increased to 14.  Was tapped 5L peritoneal
   ascites two days ago.
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation, in addition to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  dependent on lactulose at home.  Was somnolent prior
   to intubation as well, which may have been due to hypercarbia and
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia:  MCV elevated.  HCT stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 58, stable
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:   may be in acute exacerbation of heart failure in
   addition to the pleural effusion
   - restart home aldactone
   - give lasix IV
   #  DMII:  Continues on insulin drip  ; lability of sugars may be
   related to another source of infection
   - ask nutrition about diabetic tube feeds

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his hospital course and
   relevant labs, and was present for the key portion of the services
   provided.  I have reviewed the note by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9313**] and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  The patient is multiply ill with sepsis,
   liver failure, resp failure, renal insufficiency with oliguria, atrial
   fibrillation/flutter with RVR, DM  with hyperglycemia, pleural
   effusion, and obtundation from hepatic encephalopathy &/or sedation for
   his being on the vent.
   The concern today is that he has new fever and leukocytosis and has
   decreased cholecystostomy tube output along with rising bili.  Once we
   can get him stable from afib/flutter standpoint (HR at times 130) he
   should go for abd CT to assess status of biliary drainage.  Meanwhile
   we
ll stop Fentanyl, continue lactulose, and follow mental status.  His
   ET tube will be advanced 3cm to prevent inadvertent self extubation,
   his amio load will be continued along with broad spectrum antibiotics
   ([**Last Name (un) 350**] and Vanco).  The goal will be to keep him hydrated but not wet
   (eg. CVP around 9) as we try lasix drip for his oliguria.
   Given his multiple and severe comorbidities, his prognosis is very
   grave, in my estimation. He is currently a full code but we should
   continue to address this issue with his family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including respiratory failure, liver failure, renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB/RVR), diabetes mellitus (DM) with hyperglycemia, pleural effusion, and altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy and sedation for mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing infection indicated by fever, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for E. coli. He remains on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is concern for antibiotic resistance. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and urine output is essential.
2. Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated despite treatment with metoprolol and amiodarone. Continued monitoring and management of heart rate are necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's oliguria and elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio suggest acute kidney injury. Aggressive fluid management and close monitoring of renal function are required.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, exacerbated by sedation from mechanical ventilation. Lactulose should be continued, and close monitoring of neurologic status is essential.
5. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion that may contribute to respiratory compromise. Further evaluation with an abdominal CT scan is recommended to assess the status of biliary drainage.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels remain labile. Insulin therapy should be continued, and close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary.
7. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by encephalopathy, synthetic dysfunction, and portal hypertension. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and hepatic function is required.

The patient's prognosis is grave due to multiple severe comorbidities. Continuous monitoring and aggressive management of the identified complications are essential."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, E. Coli sepsis,
   respiratory failure s/p intubation.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  present vent
   settings with FiO2 to 50%, O2 sats 90s.
   - Decrease PEEP of 15 to 12.
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro, however subsequent
   culture showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  Abx changed to
   meropenem.  Sputum gram stain with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters,
   growing GNR in culture.  Blood cultures negative to date.  In last 24
   hours, has spiked to 100.1 while on meropenem.  Not on pressors
   - Continue meropenem, vanc.
   - Chest and Abd CT if pt stable enough to go to radiology
   - f/u blood, urine for g-stain and culture. - f/u stool for C. dif
   - send sputum if adequate secretions for g-stain and culture.
   - cont trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid from [**9-18**], blood, urine, and
   sputum cultures)
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Output
   yellow to brown, consistent output.  IR was asked about drainage around
   tube insertion site two days ago
 US done, non-diagnostic due to
   cannot visualize gall bladder.  T Bili elevated significantly
   -  Continue abx as above
   - ask IR about
   - Abd CT if pt stable to see about placement of cholecystostomy tube,
   if it
s still in place
   -  PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Zofran prn for nausea
   -  If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Cr improved to 1.2 today.
   Initially, FeUrea was 5.7% c/w pre-renal etiology from septic picture
   Unclear baseline; Cr was increasing, likely due to combination
   intravascular volume depletion, phenylephrine, and abdominal
   compartment syndrome.  Cr trended down s/p tap + fluid bolus with
   albumin, stable now s/p repeat paracentesis.  K was initially high, but
   has normalized.  BUN increasing out of proportion to stable Cr, now >
   100.
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia:  Ventricular rates > 120, up to 145
   overnight.  Given metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3 with HR down to 125, SBP down
   to 90s.  HR climbed back to 120s-130s. Amiodarone 5 mg drip started
   with no effect.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary
   arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone for now
 try to transition to PO amiodarone
   - infectious workup as above.  Will follow HR relative to fever curve
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.2.
   AST/ALT stable, T. bili increased to 14.  Was tapped 5L peritoneal
   ascites two days ago.
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation, in addition to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  dependent on lactulose at home.  Was somnolent prior
   to intubation as well, which may have been due to hypercarbia and
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia:  MCV elevated.  HCT stable.
   - monitor HCT
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts now 58, stable
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:   may be in acute exacerbation of heart failure in
   addition to the pleural effusion
   - restart home aldactone
   - give lasix IV
   #  DMII:  Continues on insulin drip  ; lability of sugars may be
   related to another source of infection
   - ask nutrition about diabetic tube feeds
   - continue on insulin drip because sugars so labile
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

Summary of Progress Notes:
- The patient's initial rhythm was sinus rhythm with questionable P waves, but later revealed atrial fibrillation (A.Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
- Amiodarone was started at 5 mg/hr, but the patient remained tachycardic, so the infusion continued overnight.
- The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s after lowering the heart rate with metoprolol, so the dose was reduced.
- The patient's fever persisted, and imaging may be necessary to evaluate for ongoing infection.
- Insulin requirements decreased after changing the infusion pump.
- The patient's urine output decreased despite Lasix administration."

   was initially high, but has normalized.  BUN increasing out of
   proportion to stable Cr, now > 100.
   - Trend Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr
   - nutrition c/s to consider changing to a lower protein diet
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - Consider midorine and octreotide if hepatorenal becomes concerning.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia:  Ventricular rates > 120, up to 145
   overnight.  Given metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3 with HR down to 125, SBP down

   with no effect.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary
   arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone for now.
   - infectious workup as above.  Will follow HR relative to fever curve
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current

   to intubation as well, which may have been due to hypercarbia and
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   # Anemia:  MCV elevated.  HCT stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He presented with acute cholecystitis, which was treated with cholecystostomy. The patient subsequently developed E. Coli sepsis and respiratory failure requiring intubation.

Current issues include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 15. ABG results are pending, and the plan is to wean PEEP to 13 if the ABG looks good. No need to replace the lost esophageal balloon at this point.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR), initially susceptible to zosyn but now showing intermediate sensitivity. The patient is currently on meropenem. Blood cultures are negative, but sputum gram stain shows 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters, growing GNR in culture. Fever has spiked to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. Acute cholecystitis: The patient had cholecystitis post-cholecystostomy. The drainage output is yellow to brown, consistent with bile. An ultrasound done was non-diagnostic due to the inability to visualize the gall"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, prostate cancer, and acute cholecystitis. He was admitted with sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis due to cholecystitis, which was initially caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and vancomycin. His current condition includes acute respiratory failure requiring intubation, hepatic failure with encephalopathy, renal insufficiency with oliguria, atrial fibrillation/tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and an elevated heart rate. He has ongoing fluid balance issues and requires careful management of his medications and fluids. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal electrolytes. The patient's prognosis is critical due to his multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and potential respiratory arrest.
2. Sepsis: Despite antibiotic treatment, there is a risk of ongoing sepsis, particularly if the meropenem resistance develops or if the infection spreads to other sites.
3. Acute Kidney Injury:"

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his hospital events, and
   also his labs and imaging. I was also present for the key portions of
   the services provided and I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9271**]
s note above,
   agreeing with her findings and plan of care.
   The patient continues with multiorgan system failure
 liver, lung,
   renal, and possibly neuro, all in the face of evidence of worsening
   infection and rising WBC.  The etiology of his WBC is not clear and
   we
d like to get CT of lungs and abd but he
s not been hemodynamically
   stable enough for this.  He remains on Vanco and Zosyn for biliary
   sepsis as we await another set of broad based cultures.  His CXR is

s without sputum. I fear this is gradually
   developing lung injury as by other criteria he doesn
t seem that wet.
   We
ve discussed his case at length with renal consultants and we will
   try IVF and midodrine to Rx/prevent hepatorenal, but for now no plans
   for dialysis.
   I had a frank talk  today with the patient
s daughter, [**Name (NI) 284**], about pt
   current status, grim prognosis, and the medical advisability, in my
   estimation, of changing his code status to DNR. She will talk this over
   with her mother and other family members and get back to us.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis due to an infection in the peritoneal fluid, which was initially caused by an antibiotic-resistant strain of E. coli. The patient also has respiratory failure, hepatic failure, and renal insufficiency. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but sputum and peritoneal fluid cultures are positive for gram-negative rods. His WBC count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. He has thrombocytopenia and anemia. The patient's mental status is altered due to a combination of factors including sedation from mechanical ventilation, hepatic encephalopathy, and possible delirium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are low, indicating inadequate oxygenation. This may be due to pneumonia or sepsis-induced lung injury. Increasing the PEEP and FiO2 can help improve oxygenation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is septic due to an infection in the peritoneal fluid, which is now speciated as E. coli. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient's condition requires"

   likely due to combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased
   CO from Afib with RVR,  phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment
   syndrome.  K was initially high, but has normalized.
   - Renal following and does not feel he is a candidate at this point for
   CVVH
   - Urine lytes in setting of new increase in Creatinine from prior
   - Consider low volume fluid boluses to pick up UOP.
   - Trend CVP, Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr; Re-check labs q 6
   hours for now.
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.

   include primary arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of
   resistant peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume
   depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup as above.  Will follow HR relative to fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   - if tachycardia does not decrease with fluid boluses, consider asking
   cards if amio should be stopped, or if dilt or metoprolol should be
   started in this complicated hemodynamic picture.

   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.7.
   AST/ALT stable, T. bili increased to 14.3 today.  Was tapped 5L

   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels as patient
s mental
   status cannot be addressed in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient can tolerate CT abdomen today, consider performing CT head

   likely due to combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased
   CO from Afib with RVR,  phenylephrine, and abdominal compartment
   syndrome.  K was initially high, but has normalized.
   - Renal following and does not feel he is a candidate at this point for
   CVVH
   - Urine lytes in setting of new increase in Creatinine from prior
   - Consider low volume fluid boluses to pick up UOP.
   - Trend CVP, Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr; Re-check labs q 6
   hours for now.
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.

   hepatorenal syndrome.
   - PM lytes
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter//Tachycardia:. Amiodarone 5 mg drip
   continuing with minimal effect.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia
   include primary arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of
   resistant peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume
   depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup as above.  Will follow HR relative to fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   - if tachycardia does not decrease with fluid boluses, consider asking
   cards if amio should be stopped, or if dilt or metoprolol should be
   started in this complicated hemodynamic picture.

   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels as patient
s mental
   status cannot be addressed in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient can tolerate CT abdomen today, consider performing CT head

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, which was initially suspected to be caused by an ESBL-producing E. coli but later identified as GNR. The patient has multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, hepatic failure, renal insufficiency, and thrombocytopenia. He also has anemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of acute on chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern. The low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygenation, which can lead to further organ damage and potential mortality. The current ventilator settings and FiO2 should be optimized to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is a critical condition that requires immediate attention. The source of infection seems to be bacterial peritonitis secondary to cholecystitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the patient's increasing WBC count and fever suggest ongoing infection. Cultures should be monitored, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued or adjusted based on culture results.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insuff"

   Chief Complaint:  abd pain/nausea, cholecystitis s/p cholecystomy, resp
   failure s/p intubation
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient with significant leakage of peritoneal fluid around
   cholecystostomy, dressings changed, tube fell out and was noted to be
   in only approx 2 inches.  IR was called, US was done and showed
   distended gall bladder.   Reluctant to replace tube with INR >3 and
   PLTs 60.  CT was done and shows distended gall bladder.
   - Renal following for worsening BUN and Cr
   - not on sedation, not responsive to verbal commands
   - appears to be in Aflutter rather than Afib, which may be why amio
   drip not working initially, then throughout day HR decreased to the
   90's.
   -  Desatted twice in AM to 80s--> first time PEEP increased from 10 to
   12 ; second time increased PEEP to 14 and increased FiO2 from 50% to
   60%; eventually weaned back down to PEEP 14 and FiO2 to 50%
   -  gave 1 liter bolus of NS b/c likely intravascular depleted, and did
   not increase uop; gave another 500 cc bolus b/c bp's were going down
   and did not help much. Started levophed.
   - Started octreotide and albumin for possible hepatorenal failure; did
   not start midodrine b/c had to be placed back on levophed for low maps
   - goals of care: family meeting and daughter will discuss with rest of
   family whether to make patient DNR or not. He is currently full code.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, ESBL E. Coli
   sepsis, renal insufficiency, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure
   s/p intubation all c/b afib with rvr.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  present vent
   settings with FiO2 50%, RR 20, PEEP 14. O2 sats mid 90s.
   - Check ABG and wean FIO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats and ABG
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro, however subsequent
   culture showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  Abx changed to
   meropenem [**9-19**].  Sputum gram stain with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters,
   growing GNR in culture.  Urine cultures with yeast and GNR.  Blood
   cultures negative to date.  Afebrile now, WBC stable.
   - Continue meropenem, vanc. (Day 1 of meropenem: [**9-18**]; Day 1 of Vanc:
   [**9-17**])
   - cont trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid from [**9-18**], blood, urine, and
   sputum cultures)
   - check Vanc trough today
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Decreased UOP in past [**5-18**]
   hours. Cr 2.7 today and increasing BUN.  likely due to combination of
   intravascular volume depletion, abdominal compartment syndrome,
   pressors, ? hepatorenal syndrome.
   - Renal following and does not feel he is a candidate at this point for
   CVVH
   - Urine lytes Urea nitrogen363, Cr 173, Na < 1, osmolality 369
   - receiving FFP, which should expand intravascular volume and help with
   pre-renal component
   - will wean levophed as tolerated by BP
   - started octreotide and albumin for ? hepatorenal syndrome, no
   midodrine for now given already on pressors.
   - Trend CVP, Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr; Re-check labs q 6
   hours for now.
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - PM lytes
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter//Tachycardia:. Amiodarone 5 mg drip
   continuing, HR now 70s.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include
   primary arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup/treatment as above.  Will follow HR relative to
   fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   - if tachycardia does not decrease with fluid boluses, consider asking
   cards if amio should be stopped, or if dilt or metoprolol should be
   started in this complicated hemodynamic picture.
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.1.
   AST increasing relative to [**Name2 (NI) **], likely all part of overall septic
   picture. T. bili increased over last several days, to 14. today.  Was
   tapped 5L peritoneal ascites Thursday; ([**9-18**]).
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels although renal states
   that he is not a candidate, patient
s mental status cannot be addressed
   in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient can tolerate CT abdomen today, consider performing CT head
   as well to rule out any acute process
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Tube fell
   out yesterday in context of dressing change.  Colostomy bag placed,
   output yellow clear fluid.  US and CT showed distended gall bladder.  T
   Bili elevated significantly
   - Continue abx as above
   - FFP to correct INR
 placement of cholecystostomy tube
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   - If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   # Anemia:  MCV elevated.  HCT down today, likely dilutional from FFP.
   - monitor daily HCTs
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts 62 today, stable
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:   may be in acute exacerbation of heart failure in
   addition to the pleural effusion.  New murmur today as described
   above.  ? AS [**Hospital1 1327**] MR [**First Name (Titles) 1327**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] flow murmur..
   - restarted home aldactone
   - TTE
   - will check EKG although very unlikely to be related to new ischemic
   event.
   #  DMII:  Continues on insulin drip  ; lability of sugars may be
   related to another source of infection
   - continue on insulin drip until adequate control of BS can be reached.
   - touch base with nutrition re any options for changing tube feeds in
   this patient with increasing BUN and hyperglycemia
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   Seen and examined patient with MS4 and agree with above findings.
   Briefly, this is a 70 yo male with NASH cirrhosis s/p cholecystitis
   leading to septic shock, c/b respiratory, liver, and renal failure.
   Current issues are the removal of his IR drain. Hopeful it will be
   replaced today by IR. Currently giving FFP to decrease INR. Renal
   following and [**Male First Name (un) **]
t believe he is a transplant candidate. Vent settings
   have remained unchanged. He is critically ill.

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his hospital course, labs,
   and imaging, and I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I have also reviewed HMS IV [**Location (un) 9366**]
s and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9271**]
s note
   above and agree with their findings and plan of care.  We now believe
   we know why Mr [**Known lastname **] was acting more infected over the past 2 days
   his cholecystostomy tube was likely migrating out of the gallbladder
   and and has now fallen out.  On CT scan his GB is distended and we
   been in contact with IR to see if by US or CT guidance another drainage
   catheter could be inserted.  We
ve been giving FFP in an effort to
   improve his coagulopathy for such a procedure.  Meanwhile he remains on
   Vanc and Meropenem and for today at least his WBC is down to 15K and
   he
s not metabolically acidemic.
   From a resp standpoint his CT shows RLL and LLL atelectasis, though one
   cannot also rule out pneumonitis there too.  He has only a small left
   effusion.  Above that, lungs are clear, accounting for his reasonable
   oxygenation.
   His cirrhosis remains unchanged with T Bili stable at 14.
   His renal failure is also unimproved, with BUN now up to 140 and creat
   up to 2.7.  We
re treating him for volume depletion with FFP and CVP is
tanked
 at 20.  We
re also treating him for HRSyndrome with
   Octreotide, and renal is following him too.
   He remains obtunded off of all sedatives, no doubt due to liver and
   renal failure.
   We had a long family meeting today where we discussed the medically
   complex issues, our immediate plans, and our sense of his prognosis.
   We once again outlined how sick he was, and his limited chances for
   survival.  Family seems in agreement with making all reasonable efforts
   to Rx infection, but if no progress is made in his renal and liver
   failure then they may want to change the emphasis of care.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He presented with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, which was initially caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli infection. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%, RR 20, and PEEP 14. Oxygen saturation is in the mid-90s. The plan is to wean FIO2 and PEEP as tolerated.
2. Sepsis: The patient had an infection secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by an ESBL E. coli, which has now been speciated and is showing intermediate sensitivity to zosyn. The antibiotic regimen has been changed to meropenem. The patient's WBC count is stable, and there is no fever at present.
3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's urine output has decreased, and his BUN and creatinine levels are increasing. This could be due to intravascular volume depletion, abdominal compartment syndrome, or hepatorenal syndrome. Renal following is planned, and the patient is receiving fresh"

   failure s/p intubation
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient with significant leakage of peritoneal fluid around
   cholecystostomy, dressings changed, tube fell out and was noted to be
   in only approx 2 inches.  IR was called, US was done and showed
   distended gall bladder.   Reluctant to replace tube with INR >3 and
   PLTs 60.  CT was done and shows distended gall bladder.
   - Renal following for worsening BUN and Cr
   - not on sedation, not responsive to verbal commands
   - appears to be in Aflutter rather than Afib, which may be why amio
   drip not working initially, then throughout day HR decreased to the
   90's.
   -  Desatted twice in AM to 80s--> first time PEEP increased from 10 to
   12 ; second time increased PEEP to 14 and increased FiO2 from 50% to
   60%; eventually weaned back down to PEEP 14 and FiO2 to 50%
   -  gave 1 liter bolus of NS b/c likely intravascular depleted, and did
   not increase uop; gave another 500 cc bolus b/c bp's were going down
   and did not help much. Started levophed.
   - Started octreotide and albumin for possible hepatorenal failure; did
   not start midodrine b/c had to be placed back on levophed for low maps
   - goals of care: family meeting and daughter will discuss with rest of
   family whether to make patient DNR or not. He is currently full code.
   - IR came by in the evening to place another tube, but thought the
   gallbladder may be perforated. Did not want to do it under CT b/c INR
   was high
   - Got a CT torso overnight b/c of concern for perf. Read shows
   distended gall bladder

   Code status: Full code pending family meeting today
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of decompensated congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by Escherichia coli. He underwent a cholecystostomy but experienced leakage of peritoneal fluid around the tube, which required replacement. The patient also has respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and is currently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation/flutter/tachycardia, cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and altered mental status.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Continue current ventilator settings with FiO2 to 50% and monitor oxygen saturation levels.
2. Sepsis: Continue meropenem and vancomycin antibiotics. Obtain chest and abdominal CT scans if the patient is stable enough. Follow up blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Trend creatinine and urine output. Consider low volume fluid boluses to increase urine output. Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
4. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter/Tach"

   Chief Complaint:  abd pain/nausea, cholecystitis s/p cholecystomy, resp
   failure s/p intubation
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient with significant leakage of peritoneal fluid around
   cholecystostomy, dressings changed, tube fell out and was noted to be
   in only approx 2 inches.  IR was called, US was done and showed
   distended gall bladder.   Reluctant to replace tube with INR >3 and
   PLTs 60.  CT was done and shows distended gall bladder.
   - Renal following for worsening BUN and Cr
   - not on sedation, not responsive to verbal commands
   - appears to be in Aflutter rather than Afib, which may be why amio
   drip not working initially, then throughout day HR decreased to the
   90's.
   -  Desatted twice in AM to 80s--> first time PEEP increased from 10 to
   12 ; second time increased PEEP to 14 and increased FiO2 from 50% to
   60%; eventually weaned back down to PEEP 14 and FiO2 to 50%
   -  gave 1 liter bolus of NS b/c likely intravascular depleted, and did
   not increase uop; gave another 500 cc bolus b/c bp's were going down
   and did not help much. Started levophed.
   - Started octreotide and albumin for possible hepatorenal failure; did
   not start midodrine b/c had to be placed back on levophed for low maps
   - goals of care: family meeting and daughter will discuss with rest of
   family whether to make patient DNR or not. He is currently full code.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. The patient presented with acute cholecystitis post cholecystostomy, which subsequently led to sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by an Escherichia coli infection initially susceptible to zosyn but later showing intermediate sensitivity to zosyn. The patient has also been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal insufficiency, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure post intubation. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%, RR 20, and PEEP 14, maintaining oxygen saturation in the mid-90s. He is also receiving amiodarone for atrial fibrillation/flutter, norepinephrine for hypotension, insulin for blood glucose control, and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has a history of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) leading to cirrhosis, and his INR is increasing, indicating synthetic dysfunction of the liver. 

The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors including infection, sedation for mechanical ventilation, and hepatic encephalopathy. There are plans to continue lactulose and consider hemodialysis in the setting of very high"

   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid from [**9-18**], blood, urine, and
   sputum cultures)
   - check Vanc trough today
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Decreased UOP in past [**5-18**]
   hours. Cr 2.7 today and increasing BUN.  likely due to combination of
   intravascular volume depletion, abdominal compartment syndrome,
   pressors, ? hepatorenal syndrome.

   CVVH
   - Urine lytes Urea nitrogen363, Cr 173, Na < 1, osmolality 369
   - receiving FFP, which should expand intravascular volume and help with
   pre-renal component
   - will wean levophed as tolerated by BP
   - started octreotide and albumin for ? hepatorenal syndrome, no
   midodrine for now given already on pressors.
   - Trend CVP, Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr; Re-check labs q 6
   hours for now.
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.

   continuing, HR now 70s.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include
   primary arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup/treatment as above.  Will follow HR relative to
   fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   - if tachycardia does not decrease with fluid boluses, consider asking
   cards if amio should be stopped, or if dilt or metoprolol should be
   started in this complicated hemodynamic picture.
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.1.
   AST increasing relative to [**Name2 (NI) **], likely all part of overall septic
   picture. T. bili increased over last several days, to 14. today.  Was

   - continue to hold nadolol
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels although renal states
   that he is not a candidate, patient
s mental status cannot be addressed
   in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient can tolerate CT abdomen today, consider performing CT head
   as well to rule out any acute process
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Tube fell
   out yesterday in context of dressing change.  Colostomy bag placed,
   output yellow clear fluid.  US and CT showed distended gall bladder.  T
   Bili elevated significantly

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of chronic heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and prostate cancer. He presented with acute cholecystitis and underwent cholecystostomy. However, the patient developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli, which initially showed susceptibility to zosyn but subsequent culture revealed intermediate sensitivity. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also has acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, hepatic failure, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and arterial blood gases (ABG) is essential. FiO2 and PEEP should be weaned as tolerated.

2. Sepsis: The patient is already septic with a history of ESBL E. coli in the peritoneal fluid. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and culture data should be followed. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and fluid status should be closely monitored.

3. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function has deteriorated further, evidenced by an increasing creatinine level"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, ESBL E. Coli
   sepsis, renal insufficiency, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure
   s/p intubation all c/b afib with rvr.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: s/p Intubation [**9-14**].  present vent
   settings with FiO2 50%, RR 20, PEEP 14. O2 sats mid 90s.
   - Check ABG and wean FIO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats and ABG
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, now speciated to E. Coli
   initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to cipro, however subsequent
   culture showed intermediate sensitivity to zosyn.  Abx changed to
   meropenem [**9-19**].  Sputum gram stain with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters,
   growing GNR in culture.  Urine cultures with yeast and GNR.  Blood
   cultures negative to date.  Afebrile now, WBC stable.
   - Continue meropenem, vanc. (Day 1 of meropenem: [**9-18**]; Day 1 of Vanc:
   [**9-17**])
   - cont trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (peritoneal fluid from [**9-18**], blood, urine, and
   sputum cultures)
   - check Vanc trough today
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Decreased UOP in past [**5-18**]
   hours. Cr 2.7 today and increasing BUN.  likely due to combination of
   intravascular volume depletion, abdominal compartment syndrome,
   pressors, ? hepatorenal syndrome.
   - Renal following and does not feel he is a candidate at this point for
   CVVH
   - Urine lytes Urea nitrogen363, Cr 173, Na < 1, osmolality 369
   - receiving FFP, which should expand intravascular volume and help with
   pre-renal component
   - will wean levophed as tolerated by BP
   - started octreotide and albumin for ? hepatorenal syndrome, no
   midodrine for now given already on pressors.
   - Trend CVP, Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr; Re-check labs q 6
   hours for now.
   - re-evaluate abdominal exam, bladder pressure if u/o < 30 cc/hr.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - PM lytes
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter//Tachycardia:. Amiodarone 5 mg drip
   continuing, HR now 70s.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include
   primary arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup/treatment as above.  Will follow HR relative to
   fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   - if tachycardia does not decrease with fluid boluses, consider asking
   cards if amio should be stopped, or if dilt or metoprolol should be
   started in this complicated hemodynamic picture.
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.1.
   AST increasing relative to [**Name2 (NI) **], likely all part of overall septic
   picture. T. bili increased over last several days, to 14. today.  Was
   tapped 5L peritoneal ascites Thursday; ([**9-18**]).
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels although renal states
   that he is not a candidate, patient
s mental status cannot be addressed
   in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient can tolerate CT abdomen today, consider performing CT head
   as well to rule out any acute process
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Tube fell
   out yesterday in context of dressing change.  Colostomy bag placed,
   output yellow clear fluid.  US and CT showed distended gall bladder.  T
   Bili elevated significantly
   - Continue abx as above
   - FFP to correct INR
 placement of cholecystostomy tube
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   - If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   # Anemia:  MCV elevated.  HCT down today, likely dilutional from FFP.
   - monitor daily HCTs
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts 62 today, stable
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:   may be in acute exacerbation of heart failure in
   addition to the pleural effusion.  New murmur today as described
   above.  ? AS [**Hospital1 1327**] MR [**First Name (Titles) 1327**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] flow murmur..
   - restarted home aldactone
   - TTE
   - will check EKG although very unlikely to be related to new ischemic
   event.
   #  DMII:  Continues on insulin drip  ; lability of sugars may be
   related to another source of infection
   - continue on insulin drip until adequate control of BS can be reached.
   - touch base with nutrition re any options for changing tube feeds in
   this patient with increasing BUN and hyperglycemia
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of NASH cirrhosis, chronic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, prostate cancer, and acute cholecystitis. He presented with abdominal pain and nausea, which led to the diagnosis of cholecystitis and subsequent cholecystostomy. However, the patient developed septic shock due to an infection caused by E. coli, leading to respiratory, liver, and renal failure. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation/flutter/tachycardia, hepatic encephalopathy, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.

The patient's treatment plan involves continuing meropenem and vancomycin antibiotics, FFP to correct INR, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, PPI for stress ulcers, and insulin for glycemic control. The patient's code status is full code pending family meeting today. He is currently in the ICU and critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis due to an infection caused by E. coli. If the infection continues to spread or if there is a new infection, it"

   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, ESBL E. Coli
   sepsis, renal insufficiency, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure
   s/p intubation all c/b afib with rvr.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Decreased UOP in past [**5-18**]
   hours, last 2.5 cc/hr. Cr 4.1 today and increasing BUN 153.  likely due
   to combination of abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome,
   perhaps some component of intravascular volume depletion although u/o
   decreasing despite 12 u FFP.  Phos 6.3 today
   - need to determine overall goals of care.  Family meeting yesterday
   with no change in code status.
   - Renal following and does not feel he is a candidate at this point for
   CVVH.  Overall trajectory makes CVVH/HD lower yield.  Recs include:
            - continue aluminum hydroxide 30 cc TID for phos binding.
            - re-visit decision re CVVH with renal and family.
            - change meropenem dose to 1 g daily
   - continue octreotide for ? hepatorenal
   - will not continue albumin for now, except in context of paracentesis
   - will wean levophed as tolerated by BP
   - no midodrine for now given already on norepinephrine and now
   vasopressin
   - Trend CVP, Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr; Re-check labs q 6
   hours.
   - paracentesis today with goal removal of 5L for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - PM lytes
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: overall increasing O2 requirement.  s/p
   Intubation [**9-14**].  present vent settings with FiO2 70%, RR 20, PEEP 14.
   O2 sats mid 90s.
   - Check ABG and wean FIO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats and ABG
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, urine, sputum, and bile.
   speciated to E. Coli initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to
   cipro, however subsequent culture showed intermediate sensitivity then
   resistance to zosyn.  Abx changed to meropenem [**9-19**].  Sputum gram stain
   with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters, growing GNR in culture.  Started on
   Vanc.  Urine cultures also with yeast, foley changed.  Blood cultures
   negative to date.  Temp to 100.2 at 0400 hrs on [**9-23**]. WBC increased
   [**Date range (1) 9382**], now down today.
   - Continue meropenem, (Day 1 of meropenem: [**9-18**]; today day 6.)   Plan
   to continue for 7 days from date of last negative culture.
   - d/c vanc. Day 1 of Vanc: [**9-17**], today day 7)
   - cont trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (bile from [**9-22**], blood, peritoneal fluid)
   - check Vanc trough today
   - if persistently febrile, consider changing lines, although blood
   cultures negative to date.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter//Tachycardia:. Amiodarone 5 mg drip
   continuing, total amiodarone 3.2 g as of 1500 [**9-22**].  HR now 70s.
   Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary arrhythmia (a-fib
   with RVR), fever in the setting of ongoing infection, or intravascular
   volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup/treatment as above.  Will follow HR relative to
   fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.5.
   AST increasing relative to [**Name2 (NI) **], likely all part of overall septic
   picture. T. bili increased over last several days, to 15.1. today.  Was
   tapped 5L peritoneal ascites Thursday; ([**9-18**]).
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - paracentesis with goal removal 5 L today
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels although renal states
   that he is not a candidate, patient
s mental status cannot be addressed
   in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient requires CT for other reasons, can consider CT head, but
   unlikely to be worth the risk as a stand-alone exam
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Tube fell
   out [**9-21**] in context of dressing change.  Tube replaced by IR at
   bedside on [**9-22**] under US guidance with 100 cc bilious drainage.  T
   Bili elevated significantly
   - Continue abx as above
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   - If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   # Anemia:  MCV elevated.  HCT stable to slightly up today.  Guaiac +.
   Active type and screen
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] HCTs
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts 69 today, stable
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:   may be in acute exacerbation of heart failure in
   addition to the pleural effusion.  New murmur noted [**9-22**] as described
   above.  ECHO shows moderate MR.  EKG normal.
   - restarted home aldactone
   #  DMII:  Continues on insulin drip  ; lability of sugars may be
   related to another source of infection
   - continue on insulin drip until adequate control of BS can be reached.
   - continue renal tube feeds
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   PGY-1 Addendum: Have read and agree with MSIV progress with the
   following additions.
   Physical Exam:
   Gen: Intubated, Not responsive, appears comfortable
   HEENT: +scleral icterus, PERRL, +corneal reflex
   CV: III/VI systolic murmur heard at the apex and RUSB
   Lungs: clear anteriorly
   Abd: +Distended, dull to percussion, cholecystomy tube in place
   Ext: warm, well perfused
   Plan:
   1. Acute Renal Failure: current concern for HUS by renal, being treated
   with albumin, octreotide, holding midodrine while on levophed and with
   initiation of vasopressin.  Need to readdress the role of CVVH in this
   patient with renal, given very poor prognosis, and unclear what CVVH
   would be a bridge to.
   --Continue aluminum hydroxide as a phos binder
   --tube feeds changed to renal diet
   --patient failed lasix gtt trial
   --paracentesis today as his abdomen is more distended and his renal
   function has previously responded well to paracentesis
   2.  Sepsis: patient with resistant E.coli in his peritoneal fluid and
   bile, currently being treated with meropenem, dose adjusted to 500mg
   Q12h as per renal and pharmacy, will outline current antibiotic course
   once he has negative cultures from his peritoneal fluid.
   --will restart vasopressin and hopefully be able to titrate the
   levophed down
   --will readdress goals of care with family today, after family meeting
   yesterday
   --if he remains persistently febrile will have to address lines as a
   possible source of infection
   3. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: patient currently rate controlled on
   amio infusion, total dose to date calculated yesterday with help of
   pharmacy, will likely continue load IV as prior conversion to po
   resulted in reflex tachycardia
   4.  Cirrhosis: patient currently on lactulose to help with hepatic
   encephalopathy, will continue for now
   --likely paracentesis today
   5. Anemia: patient with 6 point HCT drop over the weekend with guaiac
   positive, dark stools, not currently at transfusion threshold.  Will
   maintain an active type and screen and continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the increasing BUN and creatinine levels. This could be due to factors such as abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome, and intravascular volume depletion. It is important to closely monitor the patient's urine output, electrolyte levels, and fluid balance.

2. Sepsis: The patient has an ongoing infection caused by resistant E. coli. This can lead to further deterioration in the patient's condition and increase the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Close monitoring of vital signs, temperature, white blood cell count, and culture results is essential.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen requirements are increasing, indicating worsening respiratory function. This may be due to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or other factors. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and arterial blood gases is necessary.

4. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient has an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to poor cardiac output and further deterioration in organ function. It is important to maintain rate control and evaluate for potential underlying causes such as infection, electrolyte imbalances, or ischemia.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient has known cirrhosis with complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension. Monitoring liver function tests, electrolyte levels, and mental status is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis, sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, respiratory failure, and hepatic failure. The patient underwent a cholecystostomy procedure but developed sepsis, which led to multi-organ dysfunction. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and drains in place. The patient's condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a history of CAD/CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis. It is crucial to continue aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and source control measures to prevent further deterioration.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is evidence of acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal parameters, fluid balance, and urine output is necessary. Further evaluation for potential causes of AKI, such as hepatorenal syndrome, should be considered.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to his underlying"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent a cholecystostomy tube placement and has been on multiple antibiotics for his infection. His current vital signs show tachycardia, increased blood pressure, and decreased urine output. He has a high white blood cell count and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is also on an insulin drip for blood sugar control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by the decreasing urine output and increasing creatinine levels. This may be due to a combination of abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome, and intravascular volume depletion. It is important to monitor the patient's renal function closely and determine the underlying cause.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation. His oxygen requirement is increasing, and it is essential to wean off the FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated while monitoring the oxygen saturation and ABG results.

3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis"

   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Decreased UOP in past [**5-18**]
   hours, last 2.5 cc/hr. Cr 4.1 today and increasing BUN 153.  likely due
   to combination of abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome,
   perhaps some component of intravascular volume depletion although u/o
   decreasing despite 12 u FFP.
   - need to determine overall goals of care.  Family meeting yesterday
   with no change in code status.

   - follow O2 sats and ABG
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, urine, sputum, and bile.
   speciated to E. Coli initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to
   cipro, however subsequent culture showed intermediate sensitivity then
   resistance to zosyn.  Abx changed to meropenem [**9-19**].  Sputum gram stain
   with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters, growing GNR in culture.  Started on
   Vanc.  Urine cultures also with yeast, foley changed.  Blood cultures
   negative to date.  Temp to 100.2 at 0400 hrs on [**9-23**]. WBC increased
   [**Date range (1) 9382**], now down today.
   - Continue meropenem, (Day 1 of meropenem: [**9-18**]; today day 6.)

   # Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter//Tachycardia:. Amiodarone 5 mg drip
   continuing, HR now 70s.  Potential etiologies for tachycardia include
   primary arrhythmia (a-fib with RVR), fever in the setting of resistant
   peritoneal or other infection, or intravascular volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup/treatment as above.  Will follow HR relative to
   fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   - if tachycardia does not decrease with fluid boluses, consider asking
   cards if amio should be stopped, or if dilt or metoprolol should be
   started in this complicated hemodynamic picture.
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.1.
   AST increasing relative to [**Name2 (NI) **], likely all part of overall septic
   picture. T. bili increased over last several days, to 14. today.  Was
   tapped 5L peritoneal ascites Thursday; ([**9-18**]).
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels although renal states
   that he is not a candidate, patient
s mental status cannot be addressed
   in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient can tolerate CT abdomen today, consider performing CT head
   as well to rule out any acute process
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Tube fell
   out yesterday in context of dressing change.  Colostomy bag placed,
   output yellow clear fluid.  US and CT showed distended gall bladder.  T
   Bili elevated significantly
   - Continue abx as above
   - FFP to correct INR
 placement of cholecystostomy tube
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   - If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   # Anemia:  MCV elevated.  HCT down today, likely dilutional from FFP.
   - monitor daily HCTs
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts 62 today, stable
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:   may be in acute exacerbation of heart failure in

   - will check EKG although very unlikely to be related to new ischemic
   event.
   #  DMII:  Continues on insulin drip  ; lability of sugars may be
   related to another source of infection
   - continue on insulin drip until adequate control of BS can be reached.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of decompensated heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He presents with acute cholecystitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. He was intubated on September 14th due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR).

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics for E. coli sepsis, cholecystostomy tube placement, insulin drip for blood sugar control, norepinephrine for hemodynamic support, and amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.

His current vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 101/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 70% FiO2 with PEEP set at 14 cmH2O. His physical examination shows signs of respiratory distress, such as inspiratory rales at the lung bases and decreased breath sounds. He also has a murmur consistent with aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation. His abdomen is distended and tense.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine, liver function tests (AST, ALT), and total bilir"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, ESBL E. Coli
   sepsis, renal insufficiency, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure
   s/p intubation all c/b afib with rvr.
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Decreased UOP in past [**5-18**]
   hours, last 2.5 cc/hr. Cr 4.1 today and increasing BUN 153.  likely due
   to combination of abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome,
   perhaps some component of intravascular volume depletion although u/o
   decreasing despite 12 u FFP.  Phos 6.3 today
   - need to determine overall goals of care.  Family meeting yesterday
   with no change in code status.
   - Renal following and does not feel he is a candidate at this point for
   CVVH.  Overall trajectory makes CVVH/HD lower yield.  Recs include:
            - continue aluminum hydroxide 30 cc TID for phos binding.
            - re-visit decision re CVVH with renal and family.
            - change meropenem dose to 1 g daily
   - continue octreotide for ? hepatorenal
   - will not continue albumin for now, except in context of paracentesis
   - will wean levophed as tolerated by BP
   - no midodrine for now given already on norepinephrine and now
   vasopressin
   - Trend CVP, Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr; Re-check labs q 6
   hours.
   - paracentesis today with goal removal of 5L for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - PM lytes
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: overall increasing O2 requirement.  s/p
   Intubation [**9-14**].  present vent settings with FiO2 70%, RR 20, PEEP 14.
   O2 sats mid 90s.
   - Check ABG and wean FIO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats and ABG
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, urine, sputum, and bile.
   speciated to E. Coli initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to
   cipro, however subsequent culture showed intermediate sensitivity then
   resistance to zosyn.  Abx changed to meropenem [**9-19**].  Sputum gram stain
   with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters, growing GNR in culture.  Started on
   Vanc.  Urine cultures also with yeast, foley changed.  Blood cultures
   negative to date.  Temp to 100.2 at 0400 hrs on [**9-23**]. WBC increased
   [**Date range (1) 9382**], now down today.
   - Continue meropenem, (Day 1 of meropenem: [**9-18**]; today day 6.)   Plan
   to continue for 7 days from date of last negative culture.
   - d/c vanc. Day 1 of Vanc: [**9-17**], today day 7)
   - cont trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (bile from [**9-22**], blood, peritoneal fluid)
   - check Vanc trough today
   - if persistently febrile, consider changing lines, although blood
   cultures negative to date.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter//Tachycardia:. Amiodarone 5 mg drip
   continuing, total amiodarone 3.2 g as of 1500 [**9-22**].  HR now 70s.
   Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary arrhythmia (a-fib
   with RVR), fever in the setting of ongoing infection, or intravascular
   volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup/treatment as above.  Will follow HR relative to
   fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.5.
   AST increasing relative to [**Name2 (NI) **], likely all part of overall septic
   picture. T. bili increased over last several days, to 15.1. today.  Was
   tapped 5L peritoneal ascites Thursday; ([**9-18**]).
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - paracentesis with goal removal 5 L today
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels although renal states
   that he is not a candidate, patient
s mental status cannot be addressed
   in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient requires CT for other reasons, can consider CT head, but
   unlikely to be worth the risk as a stand-alone exam
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Tube fell
   out [**9-21**] in context of dressing change.  Tube replaced by IR at
   bedside on [**9-22**] under US guidance with 100 cc bilious drainage.  T
   Bili elevated significantly
   - Continue abx as above
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   - If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   # Anemia:  MCV elevated.  HCT stable to slightly up today.  Guaiac +.
   Active type and screen
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] HCTs
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts 69 today, stable
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:   may be in acute exacerbation of heart failure in
   addition to the pleural effusion.  New murmur noted [**9-22**] as described
   above.  ECHO shows moderate MR.  EKG normal.
   - restarted home aldactone
   #  DMII:  Continues on insulin drip  ; lability of sugars may be
   related to another source of infection
   - continue on insulin drip until adequate control of BS can be reached.
   - continue renal tube feeds
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis, sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis, renal insufficiency, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F (37.9°C), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/50 mmHg to 130/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 14 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals new onset murmurs consistent with moderate mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram. He has abdominal distention and tense abdomen, worse than previous exams. His extremities are warm and well-perfused with no cyanosis. There is no erythema around the central line or cholecystostomy tube.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, liver enzymes, and bilirubin. He has acute kidney injury with a decrease in urine output and an increase in BUN and creatinine levels. The patient's platelet"

   Agree with plan to continue current aggressive care with acv support.
   His worsening renal failure is likely related to HRS.  Cr continues to
   decline and urine outpt dropping. CVP appears adeuqtaely tanked though
   he likely needs this in setting of increased abd pressures.  Will
   continue to follow bladder pressures, repeat therapeutic paracentesis
   as low level abd compartment syndrome despite low bladder pressures has
   helped imprve urine outpt.  CVVH remains an option though given overall
   extremely grim prognosis and MOSD and presumed HRS cvvh would likely
   not change prognosis.
   He remains on octreotide but holding off on adding midodrine in setting
   of additional pressor support. Renal is following.
   From a resp standpoint his CT shows RLL and LLL atelectasis, though one
   cannot also rule out pneumonitis there too.  He has only a small left
   effusion.  His worsening volume overload and oligureia/anuria are
   liekly factoring in to his incerasing o2 requiriements and worsening
   P:F ratio.  Would use ards net TVs and peep to wean fio2 as tolerate.
    He appears more infected over wkd likely from ptc migration, now
   replaced.  Additional ifnection work up underweay with no clear new
   source identified.  Bl cx are ngtd.  if bl cx growth and continued
   aggressive care would change out central and a line.
   His cirrhosis remains unchanged with T Bili stable to increasing. We
   are montioring his coags and plts closely. tranfusing peri-procedure
   and in setting of bleeding. he continue with lactualose.
   Will resume vasopressin with hope of weaning off levophed.
   He remains obtunded off of all sedatives, no doubt due to liver and
   renal failure/toxic metabolic status. We continue lactualose.
    He remains in MOSD with very grim prognosis for recover.  We continbue

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He presented with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis due to an ESBL-producing E. coli infection. The patient has multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, liver failure, and worsening renal function.

24-hour events include percutaneous drain insertion, placement of a cholectomy tube, repositioning of the migrated tube, desaturation, continued need for pressors, and a fever spike. The patient's cholecystostomy tube migrated and was repositioned by interventional radiology (IR). He received 12 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) peri-procedure.

The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and is being treated with norepinephrine and amiodarone. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 95/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 77 K/uL, anemia with"

   Very concerning is pt
s worsening renal failure with declining urine
   outpt.  We suspect this is 2/2 HRS with tense ascitis likely further
   contributing.  His CVP appears adequately tanked though he likely needs
   this in setting of increased abd pressures.  From a resp standpoint his
   CT shows RLL and LLL atelectasis with small effusion, though one cannot
   also rule out pneumonitis. His FIO2 requirements have increased, likely
   in part related to abd distention and poor lung expansion as well as
   volume overload in the setting of progressive renal decline.
   Agree w/ plan to continue to follow bladder pressures and repeat
   therapeutic paracentesis as this has helped improve his urine outpt
   previously. We will continue to discuss with renal team and pts family
   the possibility of initiating CVVH.  Given the pts very poor prognosis
   w/ MODS and presumed HRS, while CVVH may prolong course it would not
   change his underlying poor prognosis.  We continue octreotide but will
   hold on adding midodrine in setting of additional vasopressor support.
   Renal team is following.  He remains on phos binder and we are renally
   dosing his meds.
   Will continue ACV support, using ards net TVs and peep, weaning  FIO2
   as able to maintain pao2 > 60.
    He has appeared more infected over wkd, likely from PTC migration, now
   replaced.  Additional infection work up is underway with no clear new
   source identified.  His wbc ct is coming down overall but he has
   fevers.  If he  continues to spike temps, will consider changing out
   CVL and A-line, though bl cx remain without growth to date.  He remains
   on meropenem since [**9-19**]
   We are monitoring his plts and coags closely. Will follow dic labs and
   h/h noting hct drop 2 days ago has now stabilized.
   Will resume vasopressin for BP support with hope of weaning off
   levophed.
   He remains obtunded off of all sedatives, likely [**1-13**] liver and renal
   failure/toxic metabolic status. We continue lactulose for HE component.
   Pt remains in MODS with grim prognosis for recovery.  We continue

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He is currently in the ICU due to sepsis caused by an ESBL-producing E. coli, acute cholecystitis, and MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome). The patient has had several medical interventions, including percutaneous drain insertion, cholecystostomy tube placement, and exchange of antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing issues such as sepsis, respiratory failure, liver failure, worsening renal function, leukocytosis, fevers, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A-fib w/ rvr), hyperglycemia, and increased abdominal pressures. The patient is on multiple medications, including vasopressors, diuretics, antibiotics, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis due to an ESBL-producing E. coli. Continued infection control measures and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to manage this condition.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there are concerns about atelectasis and possible pneumonitis. Careful monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings may be required.

   Agree with plan to continue current agressive care with acv support.
   His worsening renal failure is likely related to HRS.  Cr continues to
   decline and urine outpt dropping. CVP appears adeuqtaely tanked though
   he likely needs this in setting of increased abd pressures.  Will
   continue to follow bladder pressures, repeat therapeutic paracentesis
   as low level abd compartment syndrome despite low bladder pressures has
   helped imprve urine outpt.  CVVH remains an option though given overall
   extremely grim prognosis and MOSD and presumed HRS cvvh would likely
   not change prognosis.
   He remains on octreotide but holding off on adding midodrine in setting
   of additional pressor support. Renal is following.
   From a resp standpoint his CT shows RLL and LLL atelectasis, though one
   cannot also rule out pneumonitis there too.  He has only a small left
   effusion.  His worsening volume overload and oligureia/anuria are
   liekly factoring in to his incerasing o2 requiriements and worsening
   P:F ratio.  Would use ards net TVs and peep to wean fio2 as tolerate.
    He appears more infected over wkd likely from ptc migration, now
   replaced.  Additional ifnection work up underweay with no clear new
   source identified.  Bl cx are ngtd.  if bl cx growth and continued
   aggressive care would change out central and a line.
   His cirrhosis remains unchanged with T Bili stable to increasing. We
   are montioring his coags and plts closely. tranfusing peri-procedure
   and in setting of bleeding. he continue with lactualose.
   Will resume vasopressin with hope of weaning off levophed.
   He remains obtunded off of all sedatives, no doubt due to liver and
   renal failure/toxic metabolic status. We continue lactualose.
    He remains in MOSD with very grim prognosis for recover.  We continbue
   current level of aggreressive care and continue tio meet with and
   update family regarding goals.
   remainser as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is cholecystitis, respiratory failure, and sepsis caused by ESBL E. coli. The patient underwent percutaneous drain insertion and had a cholectomy tube placed. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the week, with the migration and repositioning of the cholecystostomy tube, desaturation requiring high levels of supplemental oxygen, continued reliance on pressors, and worsening renal function.

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver, chronic renal failure, and ascites. The patient is currently on aggressive care with CVVH support due to acute kidney injury and suspected hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with worsening hypoxia and increased oxygen requirements.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, warm skin, edema in both lower extremities, and a new murmur heard on auscultation. The patient is unresponsive and has no spontaneous movement.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, and hyperglycemia. Imaging studies reveal right lower lobe atelectasis and left lower lobe atelectasis.

The patient's condition is assessed as respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), chronic respiratory failure, calculous cholecystitis, and chronic liver disease with cirrhosis. The patient's prognosis is described as"

   drainage and replacement)
          Acute on CRI
          Resp failure

          A-fib w/ rvr
          hyperglycemia/labile
   Very concerning is pt
s worsening renal failure with declining urine
   outpt.  We suspect this is 2/2 HRS with tense ascitis likely further
   contributing.  His CVP appears adequately tanked though he likely needs
   this in setting of increased abd pressures.  From a resp standpoint his
   CT shows RLL and LLL atelectasis with small effusion, though one cannot
   also rule out pneumonitis. His FIO2 requirements have increased, likely
   in part related to abd distention and poor lung expansion as well as
   volume overload in the setting of progressive renal decline.
   Agree w/ plan to continue to follow bladder pressures and repeat
   therapeutic paracentesis as this has helped improve his urine outpt
   previously. We will continue to discuss with renal team and pts family
   the possibility of initiating CVVH.  Given the pts very poor prognosis
   w/ MODS and presumed HRS, while CVVH may prolong course it would not
   change his underlying poor prognosis.  We continue octreotide but will
   hold on adding midodrine in setting of additional vasopressor support.
   Renal team is following.  He remains on phos binder and we are renally
   dosing his meds.
   Will continue ACV support, using ards net TVs and peep, weaning  FIO2
   as able to maintain pao2 > 60.
    He has appeared more infected over wkd, likely from PTC migration, now
   replaced.  Additional infection work up is underway with no clear new
   source identified.  His wbc ct is coming down overall but he has
   fevers.  If he  continues to spike temps, will consider changing out
   CVL and A-line, though bl cx remain without growth to date.  He remains
   on meropenem since [**9-19**]
   We are monitoring his plts and coags closely. Will follow dic labs and
   h/h noting hct drop 2 days ago has now stabilized.
   Will resume vasopressin for BP support with hope of weaning off
   levophed.
   He remains obtunded off of all sedatives, likely [**1-13**] liver and renal
   failure/toxic metabolic status. We continue lactulose for HE component.
   Pt remains in MODS with grim prognosis for recovery.  We continue
   current level of aggressive care and continue to meet with and update
   family regarding goals.

   PTC replacement noting temporal relationship.  Labs prior to para show
   HCT drop to 22 from 26.  (Hct was 32  2 days ago but then stabilized at

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) who is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with ESBL E. coli sepsis in the setting of acute cholecystitis, which has led to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). 

The patient's active issues include ESBL E. coli sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, liver failure with a history of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), ascites, leukocytosis, fevers, thrombocytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, altered mental status/delirium, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A-fib w/ rvr), and hyperglycemia.

The patient's condition is worsening, particularly with declining urine output. The healthcare team suspects this may be due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease. The patient's CVP appears adequately tanked, but he likely needs this due to increased abdominal pressures. 

The patient's CT scan shows right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) atelectasis with a small effusion, although it is difficult to rule out pneumonitis. His Fi"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and developed sepsis due to an infection caused by ESBL E. coli. He has multi-organ failure, including renal, hepatic, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 60% and PEEP 14. He is also receiving vasopressin and amiodarone. He has a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration and has been transfused with packed red blood cells. The patient has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including infection, sedation from mechanical ventilation, hepatic encephalopathy, and uremia. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is gross blood in his peritoneal fluid. The patient's condition is complicated by DIC, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation/flutter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis due to an infection caused by ESBL E. coli. This increases the risk of further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Multi-organ Failure: The patient has multi-organ failure involving the kidneys, liver, and lungs. This puts him at high risk for complications related"

 92,  s/p transfusion of
   cryoprecipitate.
   - follow Q6hr fibrinogen with cryo transfusion for fibrinogen < 50
   #. Acute Renal Failure:
   Current concern for HUS by renal, being treated with albumin,
   octreotide, holding midodrine while on levophed and with initiation of
   vasopressin.  Need to readdress the role of CVVH in this patient with
   renal, given very poor prognosis, and unclear what CVVH would be a
   bridge to.  tube feeds changed to renal diet yesterday
   - Continue aluminum hydroxide as a phos binder
   - patient failed lasix gtt trial
   - could not do large volume paracentesis yesterday due to gross blood
   in ascitic fluid
   - continue octreotide and albumin
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Decreased UOP in past [**5-18**]
   hours, last 2.5 cc/hr. Cr 4.1 today and increasing BUN 153.  likely due
   to combination of abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome,
   perhaps some component of intravascular volume depletion although u/o
   decreasing despite 12 u FFP.  Phos 6.3 today
   - need to determine overall goals of care.  Family meeting yesterday
   with no change in code status.
   - Renal following and does not feel he is a candidate at this point for
   CVVH.  Overall trajectory makes CVVH/HD lower yield.  Recs include:
            - continue aluminum hydroxide 30 cc TID for phos binding.
            - re-visit decision re CVVH with renal and family.
            - change meropenem dose to 1 g daily
   - continue octreotide for ? hepatorenal
   - will not continue albumin for now, except in context of paracentesis
   - will wean levophed as tolerated by BP
   - no midodrine for now given already on norepinephrine and now
   vasopressin
   - Trend CVP, Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr; Re-check labs q 6
   hours.
   - paracentesis today with goal removal of 5L for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - PM lytes
   #.  Sepsis: patient with resistant E.coli in his peritoneal fluid and
   bile, currently being treated with meropenem, dose adjusted to 500mg
   Q12h as per renal and pharmacy, will outline current antibiotic course
   once he has negative cultures from his peritoneal fluid.
   --will restart vasopressin and hopefully be able to titrate the
   levophed down
   --will readdress goals of care with family today, after family meeting
   yesterday
   --if he remains persistently febrile will have to address lines as a
   possible source of infection
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, urine, sputum, and bile.
   speciated to E. Coli initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to
   cipro, however subsequent culture showed intermediate sensitivity then
   resistance to zosyn.  Abx changed to meropenem [**9-19**].  Sputum gram stain
   with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters, growing GNR in culture.  Started on
   Vanc.  Urine cultures also with yeast, foley changed.  Blood cultures
   negative to date.  Temp to 100.2 at 0400 hrs on [**9-23**]. WBC increased
   [**Date range (1) 9382**], now down today.
   - Continue meropenem, (Day 1 of meropenem: [**9-18**]; today day 6.)   Plan
   to continue for 7 days from date of last negative culture.
   - d/c vanc. Day 1 of Vanc: [**9-17**], today day 7)
   - cont trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (bile from [**9-22**], blood, peritoneal fluid)
   - check Vanc trough today
   - if persistently febrile, consider changing lines, although blood
   cultures negative to date.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: overall increasing O2 requirement.  s/p
   Intubation [**9-14**].  present vent settings with FiO2 70%, RR 20, PEEP 14.
   O2 sats mid 90s.
   - Check ABG and wean FIO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats and ABG
   #. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: patient currently rate controlled on
   amio infusion,
   - keep track of total amio infusion dose
   - will likely continue load IV as prior conversion to po resulted in
   reflex tachycardia
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter//Tachycardia:. Amiodarone 5 mg drip
   continuing, total amiodarone 3.2 g as of 1500 [**9-22**].  HR now 70s.
   Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary arrhythmia (a-fib
   with RVR), fever in the setting of ongoing infection, or intravascular
   volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup/treatment as above.  Will follow HR relative to
   fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   #.  Cirrhosis: patient currently on lactulose to help with hepatic
   encephalopathy, will continue for now
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.5.
   AST increasing relative to [**Name2 (NI) **], likely all part of overall septic
   picture. T. bili increased over last several days, to 15.1. today.  Was
   tapped 5L peritoneal ascites Thursday; ([**9-18**]).
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - paracentesis with goal removal 5 L today
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   #. Anemia: patient with 6 point HCT drop over the weekend and another 4
   point drop in Hct yesterday afternoon.  Gross blood found in peritoneal
   fluid.   Transfused 1u pRBCs yesterday.  Has GI bleed hx and guaiac +
   stools as well.
   - Will maintain an active type and screen
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels although renal states
   that he is not a candidate, patient
s mental status cannot be addressed
   in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient requires CT for other reasons, can consider CT head, but
   unlikely to be worth the risk as a stand-alone exam
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Tube fell
   out [**9-21**] in context of dressing change.  Tube replaced by IR at
   bedside on [**9-22**] under US guidance with 100 cc bilious drainage.  T
   Bili elevated significantly
   - Continue abx as above
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   - If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts 69 today, stable
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:   may be in acute exacerbation of heart failure in
   addition to the pleural effusion.  New murmur noted [**9-22**] as described
   above.  ECHO shows moderate MR.  EKG normal.
   - restarted home aldactone
   #  DMII:  Continues on insulin drip  ; lability of sugars may be
   related to another source of infection
   - continue on insulin drip until adequate control of BS can be reached.
   - continue renal tube feeds
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

   Disposition:  ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and prostate cancer. He was admitted with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis due to an infection caused by ESBL-producing E. coli. The patient has several ongoing complications and comorbidities that need to be addressed.

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by an increasing serum creatinine level and a decrease in urine output. There is a concern for hepatorenal syndrome and abdominal compartment syndrome. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been considered as a treatment option, but the patient's prognosis is poor, and the role of CVVH is unclear. The patient's fluid balance shows an overall positive balance.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's BUN is increasing, and there is a decrease in urine output. The likely causes include abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome, and intravascular volume depletion. The phosphate level is within normal limits.

3. Sepsis: The patient has been treated with meropenem for the resistant E. coli infection. Blood cultures are negative, but cultures from peritoneal fluid, urine, and sputum show"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Renal may consider CVVH to get some volume off if oxygenation gets
   worse and there are no other options, but not likely because he may not
   tolerate especially w hypotension and on levophed; we should readdress
   goals of care w family today
   - DCed vancomycin b/c has had full 8 day course (and level is so high
   that he wont need anymore dosing to last for a while); vanc was started
   to cover Gm+ cocci in sputum which didn't grow out in cultures
   - continues with increased FiO2 requirement at 70%--> decreased to 60%
   FiO2, tolerated well in evening (O2sat 94%)
   - want to keep tidal volumes down to fit w ARDS protocol (b/c his p:f
   ratios suggest ARDS)
   - PM Hct showed Hct drop from 26--> 22
   - s/p Diagnostic tap -- peritoneal fluid grossly bloody, so volume tap
   aborted --> fluid shows Hct 3% and WBC 333.
   - 1u pRBCs transfused
   - family updated by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5027**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9173**].  overnight, we promised to call
   daughter [**Name (NI) 284**] if pressor requirement increases or if pt needing lots of
   transfusions, or if respiratory status declining quickly.
   - DIC labs sent -- fibrinogen low at 77, D-dimer high --> checking Q6h
   DIC labs.  1bag Cryo transfused.
   - post-transfusion Hct: bumped from 22--> 23.9 , not quite appropriate
   - 10pm Fibrinogen = 102 (UpToDate says to give cryo if <50 to keep
   fibrinogen >100, so did not give cryo at this time)

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer,
   found to have acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy, ESBL E. Coli
   sepsis, renal insufficiency, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure
   s/p intubation all c/b afib with rvr.
   # DIC:
   #. Acute Renal Failure:
   Current concern for HUS by renal, being treated with albumin,
   octreotide, holding midodrine while on levophed and with initiation of
   vasopressin.  Need to readdress the role of CVVH in this patient with
   renal, given very poor prognosis, and unclear what CVVH would be a
   bridge to.  tube feeds changed to renal diet yesterday
   --Continue aluminum hydroxide as a phos binder
   --patient failed lasix gtt trial
   --could not do large volume paracentesis yesterday due to gross blood
   in ascetic fluid
   #  Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency:   Decreased UOP in past [**5-18**]
   hours, last 2.5 cc/hr. Cr 4.1 today and increasing BUN 153.  likely due
   to combination of abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome,
   perhaps some component of intravascular volume depletion although u/o
   decreasing despite 12 u FFP.  Phos 6.3 today
   - need to determine overall goals of care.  Family meeting yesterday
   with no change in code status.
   - Renal following and does not feel he is a candidate at this point for
   CVVH.  Overall trajectory makes CVVH/HD lower yield.  Recs include:
            - continue aluminum hydroxide 30 cc TID for phos binding.
            - re-visit decision re CVVH with renal and family.
            - change meropenem dose to 1 g daily
   - continue octreotide for ? hepatorenal
   - will not continue albumin for now, except in context of paracentesis
   - will wean levophed as tolerated by BP
   - no midodrine for now given already on norepinephrine and now
   vasopressin
   - Trend CVP, Cr and U/O with goal u/o > 30 cc/hr; Re-check labs q 6
   hours.
   - paracentesis today with goal removal of 5L for component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
   - PM lytes
   #.  Sepsis: patient with resistant E.coli in his peritoneal fluid and
   bile, currently being treated with meropenem, dose adjusted to 500mg
   Q12h as per renal and pharmacy, will outline current antibiotic course
   once he has negative cultures from his peritoneal fluid.
   --will restart vasopressin and hopefully be able to titrate the
   levophed down
   --will readdress goals of care with family today, after family meeting
   yesterday
   --if he remains persistently febrile will have to address lines as a
   possible source of infection
   #  Sepsis:  Sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis secondary to
   cholecystitis with GNR in peritoneal fluid, urine, sputum, and bile.
   speciated to E. Coli initially susceptible to zosyn, resistant to
   cipro, however subsequent culture showed intermediate sensitivity then
   resistance to zosyn.  Abx changed to meropenem [**9-19**].  Sputum gram stain
   with 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters, growing GNR in culture.  Started on
   Vanc.  Urine cultures also with yeast, foley changed.  Blood cultures
   negative to date.  Temp to 100.2 at 0400 hrs on [**9-23**]. WBC increased
   [**Date range (1) 9382**], now down today.
   - Continue meropenem, (Day 1 of meropenem: [**9-18**]; today day 6.)   Plan
   to continue for 7 days from date of last negative culture.
   - d/c vanc. Day 1 of Vanc: [**9-17**], today day 7)
   - cont trend WBC and fever curve.
   - F/u culture data (bile from [**9-22**], blood, peritoneal fluid)
   - check Vanc trough today
   - if persistently febrile, consider changing lines, although blood
   cultures negative to date.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: overall increasing O2 requirement.  s/p
   Intubation [**9-14**].  present vent settings with FiO2 70%, RR 20, PEEP 14.
   O2 sats mid 90s.
   - Check ABG and wean FIO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - position paient in reverse trendelenburg
   - follow O2 sats and ABG
   #. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: patient currently rate controlled on
   amio infusion,
   - keep track of total amio infusion dose
   - will likely continue load IV as prior conversion to po resulted in
   reflex tachycardia
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter//Tachycardia:. Amiodarone 5 mg drip
   continuing, total amiodarone 3.2 g as of 1500 [**9-22**].  HR now 70s.
   Potential etiologies for tachycardia include primary arrhythmia (a-fib
   with RVR), fever in the setting of ongoing infection, or intravascular
   volume depletion.
   - continue amiodarone gtt for now; patient did not tolerate attempts to
   po form as tachycardia increased significantly
   - Consider daily EKG
s as demand of heart in this setting deams patient
   at high risk for ischemia/infarction.
   - infectious workup/treatment as above.  Will follow HR relative to
   fever curve
   - consider levothyroxine increased serum levels in setting of liver and
   renal failure; will f/u on clearance of this drug
   #.  Cirrhosis: patient currently on lactulose to help with hepatic
   encephalopathy, will continue for now
   #  Cirrhosis secondary to NASH:  The patient has known cirrhosis
   complicated by encephalopathy requiring lactulose.  He has current
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an increasing INR,  now at 2.5.
   AST increasing relative to [**Name2 (NI) **], likely all part of overall septic
   picture. T. bili increased over last several days, to 15.1. today.  Was
   tapped 5L peritoneal ascites Thursday; ([**9-18**]).
   - continue lactulose, goal [**3-16**] BMs per day
   - paracentesis with goal removal 5 L today
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend coags, LFTs, platelets
   - continue to hold nadolol
   #. Anemia: patient with 6 point HCT drop over the weekend and another 4
   point drop in Hct yesterday afternoon.  Gross blood found in peritoneal
   fluid.   Transfused 1u pRBCs yesterday.  Has GI bleed hx and guaiac +
   stools as well.
   - Will maintain an active type and screen
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
   #  Altered mental status:  Delirium in setting of infection, in
   addition to sedation for mechanical ventilation likely still in system
   as cannot clear drug effectively, in addition to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.
   - Continue to hold fentanyl and versed as patient can tolerate
   - Continue lactulose for probability of some hepatic encephalopathy
   - Consider HD in setting of very high BUN levels although renal states
   that he is not a candidate, patient
s mental status cannot be addressed
   in setting of sedation
   - F/U urine, blood, sputum, and peritoneal cultures.  Continue
   treatment for underlying sepsis.
   - If patient requires CT for other reasons, can consider CT head, but
   unlikely to be worth the risk as a stand-alone exam
   # Acute cholecystitis:  s/p cholycystostomy by IR on [**9-13**].  Tube fell
   out [**9-21**] in context of dressing change.  Tube replaced by IR at
   bedside on [**9-22**] under US guidance with 100 cc bilious drainage.  T
   Bili elevated significantly
   - Continue abx as above
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   - If significant pain, will give prn dilaudid.
   #  Thrombocytopenia:  Plts 69 today, stable
   - continue to trend.
   - transfusion threshold < 10 or < 30 if bleeding
   #  Hx of CAD/dCHF:   may be in acute exacerbation of heart failure in
   addition to the pleural effusion.  New murmur noted [**9-22**] as described
   above.  ECHO shows moderate MR.  EKG normal.
   - restarted home aldactone
   #  DMII:  Continues on insulin drip  ; lability of sugars may be
   related to another source of infection
   - continue on insulin drip until adequate control of BS can be reached.
   - continue renal tube feeds
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue outpatient levothyroxine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, prostate cancer, who presented with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis secondary to bacterial peritonitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as evidenced by decreasing urine output and increasing creatinine levels. There is concern for hepatorenal syndrome and possible abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient's fluid balance needs to be carefully managed, and the role of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) should be readdressed.
2. Sepsis: The patient has resistant E. coli infection in various body fluids, including peritoneal fluid, bile, and urine. The current antibiotic regimen includes meropenem, and the decision to continue or change antibiotics will depend on culture results. Source control measures, such as removing infected lines, may be necessary.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen requirements are increasing, indicating worsening hypoxic respiratory failure. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP should be done cautiously while monitoring oxygen saturation and ABG values.
4. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient is currently rate-controlled on amiodarone infusion. Conversion to sinus rhythm may be attempted once the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD, prostate cancer. He was found to have acute cholecystitis, sepsis caused by ESBL E. coli, renal and hepatic failure, and respiratory failure for which he was intubated.

The patient is currently experiencing multi-organ failure and is on multiple pressors including vasopressin and levophed. He is also receiving treatment for DIC, atrial fibrillation/flutter, cirrhosis, anemia, altered mental status, acute cholecystitis, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and potentially life-threatening complications.

2. Renal failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, and there is concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). If not managed properly, this can progress to end-stage renal disease.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 at 60% and PEEP at 14. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to underlying lung issues and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

4. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing se"

          A-fib w/ rvr
          hyperglycemia/labile
   Pt with overall continued clinical decline.  He is anuric, now with
   slowly rising K.  We suspect this is 2/2 HRS and sepsis with ascites
   likely further contributing.  Despite total body overload, we have been
   able to decrease his FIO2 back down to 60% which he is tolerating.
   Agree with plan to continue ACV, ards net volumes, he is oxygenating
   well on 60% fio2 despite total volume overload and his plts are holding
   < 3O at present.
   Despite his progressive ARF now with rising K, given his very poor
   prognosis w/ MODS and presumed HRS, initiation of CVVH would not change
   his underlying course, noting very high mortality in this pt population
   despite CVVH.  Renal team is in agreement and their input is
   appreciated.  We continue octreotide holding on midodrine in setting of
   additional vasopressor support. He remains on phos binder and we are
   renally dosing his meds.  We will discuss/address ongoing goals of care
   in family mtg today, as we do not feel that CVVH would be a bridge to
   recovery.
   Suspect intraperitoneal bleeding related to traumatic PTC placement as
   etiology of hct drop given temporal relationship. Approp bump post
   transfusion. Low fibrinogen likely related to cirrhosis/low level DIC/
   and consumptive process in setting of bleeding.  We continue to follow
   hct/fibrinogen and will transfuse for active bleeding. Will hold on
   repeat para asscites is likely further tamponading his bleeding.
   His wbc ct and fever curve are trending down. He appeared more infected
   over wkd, likely from PTC migration, now replaced He remains on [**Last Name (un) **]
   (since [**9-19**]). Bl cx remain NGTD. If he continues to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**]
   consider changing CVL and A-line, though will hold on these
   interventions pending family mtg.
   Pt remains in MODS with grim prognosis for recovery.  We continue
   current level of aggressive care and continue to meet with and update
   family regarding goals.  Plan for family meeting this afternoon with
   extended family arriving.  Will hold off on line changes / invasive
   proceudres pending further goals of care discussions.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo M w/ d CHF, cirrhosis, CRI with ESBL e coli sepsis in setting of
   acute cholecystitis c/b MODS
   Active issues remain:
          ESBL e cli sepsis (peritonitis, acute cholecystitis s/p ptc
   drainage and replacement)
          Acute on CRI
          Resp failure
          Liver failure with h/o cirrhosis from NASH, ascitis
          Leukocytosis
          Fevers
          Thrombocytopenia
          Anemia
          coagulopathy
          AMS/delirium
          A-fib w/ rvr
          hyperglycemia/labile
   Anuric.  Now with slowly rising K. We suspect this is 2/2 HRS with
   ascitis likely further contributing.  His CVP is adequately tanked
   though he likely needs this in setting of increased abd pressures.
   Despite total body overload, we were able to decrease his FIO2back down
   to 60% which he is tolerating.
   Agree w/ plan to continue supporting with ACV, ards net volumes.
   Pressure on vent are holing snd he oxygenating well on 60% fio2 despite
   total volume overload.
   Rehgarding his worsening renal failure, we are unable to remove volume
   and his K is slowly rising.  Given the pts very poor prognosis w/ MODS
   and presumed HRS, while CVVH may prolong course it would not change his
   underlying poor prognosis.  We continue octreotide but will hold on
   adding midodrine in setting of additional vasopressor support. Renal
   team is following.  He remains on phos binder and we are renally dosing
   his meds.  We will dicuss/address ongoing goals of care in family mtg
   today, as CVVH would not be a bridge to recovery.
   His hct has bumnpoed appropraitely after 1 unit.  Suspect some intrasbd
   bleeding related to traumatic PTC placement. His low fibirniogen likely
   related to low level dic/consumptive process.  We continue to follow
   hct/dic panel and transfuse for active bleeding. Will hgold on para as
   this is likely further tamponading his bleeding.
   He has appeared more infected over wkd, likely from PTC migration, now
   replaced.  Additional infection work up is underway with no clear new
   source identified.  His wbc ct is coming down overall but he has
   fevers.  If he  continues to spike temps, will consider changing out
   CVL and A-line, though bl cx remain without growth to date.  He remains
   on meropenem since [**9-19**]
   He remains on  vasopressin for BP support.
   He remains obtunded off of all sedatives, some grimace to sternal rub.
    Likely [**1-13**] liver and renal failure/toxic metabolic status. We continue
   lactulose for HE component.
   Pt remains in MODS with grim prognosis for recovery.  We continue
   current level of aggressive care and continue to meet with and update
   family regarding goals.  Wouyld hold off on line changes given neg
   blood cx and will disucss further invasive interventiolns in family mtg
   today.
   Remainder as per resident note.

   Total time spent: 50 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history and is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is cirrhosis, and they have multiple ongoing medical complications including:

1. ESBL E. coli sepsis: The patient has an infection caused by a strain of E. coli that is resistant to common antibiotics. This infection is causing peritonitis and acute cholecystitis.

2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency (CRI): The patient's pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency has worsened, leading to decreased kidney function.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's lungs are not adequately oxygenating blood, which may be due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

4. Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis, likely caused by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This has resulted in liver dysfunction and ascites.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.

6. Anemia and coagulopathy: The patient has low hemoglobin levels and abnormal blood clotting parameters.

7. AMS/delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status and delirium.

8. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has an irregular heartbeat with a fast heart rate.

9. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugar levels.

10. Anuria:"
