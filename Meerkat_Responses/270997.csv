 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
   [**Age over 90 **]F with CAD, thoracic aortic aneurysm, gastritis, GERD admitted with
   left shoulder pain, nausea with transient relative hypotension in
   context of [**Name (NI) 9631**]
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Pt is now hypoxic with increased O2
   requirement. This may be atelectasis with RLL collapse. Also, consider
   aspiration PNA as she has infiltrate on CXR,  high NGT output and there
   was NSG concern for aspiration, and WBC increased today. Hiatal hernia
   may be pushing on lungs decreasing her ability to ventilate. Also, may
   be fluid overloaded as she has received 2-3L fluid in ED and has been
   on maintance fluids but is hypernatremic and hemoconcentrated and may
   be intravascularly dry. ARDS is also on differential

   surgical decompression. Associated with nausea and high NGT output.
   Differential includes gastritis, GERD, anginal equivalent, obstruction,
   cholecystitis, pancreatitis, colitis. Laboratory data not consistent
   with liver/gallbladder/pancreatic pathology. No evidence of obstruction
   or colitis on CT abdomen/pelvis. First set cardiac biomarkers within
   normal limits.
   - H2 blocker daily (renal dosing), PPI [**Hospital1 7**]

   #. Shoulder pain: possibly referred pain due to hiatal hernia. Concern
   for ACS but CE negative x3. No evidence of dissection on CT.  [**Month (only) 51**] also
   be in part to reflux/gastritis, and H2blocker dose was increased to

   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Pt is now hypoxic with increased O2
   requirement. This may be atelectasis with RLL collapse. Also, consider

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), thoracic aortic aneurysm, gastritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She was admitted with left shoulder pain, nausea, and transient relative hypotension. The differential diagnosis includes hiatal hernia, gastritis, anginal equivalent, obstruction, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and colitis. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, previous inferior myocardial infarction, and diffuse atherosclerosis found during cardiac catheterization. She also has chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, known esophageal varices, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic heart failure, osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, and gout. 

The patient's current vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (91 bpm) and blood pressure (131/69 mmHg). The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal range at 99%. The physical examination reveals a supple neck, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and no lower extremity edema. 

The patient has received various medications including morphine, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and famotidine. The laboratory results show moderately hemolyzed blood with slightly elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count.

   Assessment and Plan
   Possible gastric entrapment.  Clinical evidence for worsening over past
   24 hrs.
   HYPOTENSION -- transient and resolved.  Attributed to hypovolemia and
   nitroglycerin use.  Doubt sepsis, but may be related to evolving GI
   pathology.   Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to possible ARDS (aspiration of
   gastric contents), or evolving pneumonia.  Monitor RR, SaO2,
   supplimental oxygen, treat empirical antimicrobials.  Maintain SaO2
   >90%.
   SHOULDER PAIN -- No evidence for CAD (i.e. anginal equivalent), no
   evidence for cardiac ischemia.  Possible related to hiatal/gastric
   hernia.
   NAUSEA / EMESIS -- no evidence for cardiac ischemia.  Suspect related
   to gastric/hiatial hernia, possible gastric entrapment or volvulus.
   Surgery Consultation following.  Maintain NPO.
   HIATAL/GASTRIC HERNIA -- concern for enlargement and entrapment.
   Recommend surgical correction.  Thoracic surgery consulted and
   following, but patient specifically requests Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 518**] -->
   need to contact.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Evolving.  Change to D51/2 NS.
   THORACIC ANEURYSM -- stable by CT scan.
   A-FiB -- rate controlled. Hold anticoagulation.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reversal
   if surgery required.
   FLUIDS -- s/p resussitation.  Remains euvolemic, maintain hydration
   with maintenence fluid.  Desire foley catheter placement to more
   accurately monitor I/O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evalutation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing increased oxygen requirements overnight and has a worsening hiatal/gastric hernia as seen on the chest X-ray. The nasogastric tube drainage has evolved into darker material, but guiac testing is negative for blood.

The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, Percocet (oxycodone Hcl/acetaminophen), and codeine. They have also received infusions of morphine sulfate, famotidine (Pepcid), metoprolol, and pantoprazole (Protonix). Other medications include antibiotics.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress and abdominal pain. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal vital signs, and normal heart rhythm. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an aerosol-cool device with a SpO2 of 93%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 41, PaO2 of 126, and FiO2 of 0.21.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 11.9 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) at 131 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 28 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.3 mg/dL, and glucose at 174 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include possible gastric entrapment, hypotension, respiratory distress, shoulder pain, nausea/emesis, hiatal/gastric hernia, hypernatremia, thoracic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation (AF), and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment for these conditions. Surgical consultation has been requested for the hiatal/gastric hernia, and the patient is stable for transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) service."

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has a history of worsening hiatal/gastric hernia, for which an NG tube was placed. The NGT drainage evolved to darker material, but guiac negative. The patient's oxygen requirement increased overnight.

The patient has a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and a history of thyroid disease. They also have allergies to morphine, Percocet, and codeine.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 121/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal pupils, and no signs of jugular venous distention or peripheral edema. The patient's lungs are clear, with scattered coarse crackles. Abdominal examination shows no tenderness or distension, and bowel sounds are present. Neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL, platelet count of 131 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and troponin T level below 0.01. Other labs are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
- Possible gastric entrapment due to worsening over the past 24 hours.
- Hypotension resolved and attributed to hypovolemia and nitroglycerin use.
- Respiratory distress attributed to possible ARDS or evolving pneumonia.
- Shoulder pain possibly related to hiatal/gastric hernia.
- Nausea/vomiting suspect related to gastric/hiatal hernia or gastric entrapment.
- Surgical consultation recommended for hiatal/gastric hernia correction.
- Hypernatremia evolving, change to D51/2 NS.
- Thoracic aneurysm stable by CT scan.
- A-Fib rate controlled, hold anticoagulation.
- Fluids remain euvolemic, maintain hydration with maintenance fluid.
- Foley catheter placement desired for accurate monitoring of I/O.
- NPO pending evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastric entrapment due to worsening hiatal/gastric hernia.
2. ARDS (aspiration of gastric contents) or evolving pneumonia.
3. Hypernatremia.
4. Thoracic aneurysm.
5. Atrial fibrillation.

The patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and prompt intervention to address the potential medical complications."
