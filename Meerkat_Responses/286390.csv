   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Pt was originally admitted after being found down for
   several days complaining of general malaise. After undergoing emergent
   dialysis he was transferred to the floor. On the floor pt was noted to
   be hypotensive. Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with
   + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending, bld cultures show 4/4 bottles GPC
   with speciation pending.  Line with 4+ GPC on gram stain
   - will f/u blood cultures for speciation
   - continue on broad spectrum with Zosyn/Vanc
   - will consult IR to place temporary line, as renal unable to place [**1-25**]
   scarring
   - transplant surgery will remove HD line today
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Pt still
   endorses a lot of back pain and weakness with hip flexion/adduction.
   Given finding of abscesses, and +bld cultures it is possible pt may
   have epidural abscess. Discussed with radiology about using MRI with
   GAD given pt is on dialysis. Per Radiology there may still be a risk
   for NSF. Could image without GAD however would not completely rule out
   abscess. Have consulted Neurology with regards to whether MRI w/o GAD
   coupled with CT scan w/ contast is enough to rule out epidural abscess.
   - f/u final Neurology recs regarding imaging recommendations. After
   speaking with neuro resident and neurorads attg, unlikely to gain
   additional information re: epidural abscess with MRI w/o contrast since
   already have CT spine w/ contrast
   -f/u final read CT spine to potentially d/c neck brace
   - Morphine IV and PO for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent. Hyperkalemic to 6, s/p kayexelate.
   No EKG changes. Pt received dialysis on admission, Renal is currently
   following pt and he needs dialysis today. Will place line today (IR)
   - continue on HD
   - check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   - f/u digoxin level
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine. Has not been receiving Levetiracetam because gets with
   dialysis. Neuro concerned about nonepileptic seizures.
   -consider EEG, f/u final neuro recs
   .
   ##. FEN: NPO/aspiration precautions pending speech and swallow eval,
   hyperkalemia-kayexelate and trend K, continue on dialysis
   .
   ##. Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%.
- He was initially admitted for suspected gram-positive cocci (GPC) sepsis from his hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).
- The patient has been experiencing general malaise, back pain, and was found down on the floor.
- He has multiple blood cultures and line culture pending, with blood cultures showing 4/4 bottles positive for GPC.
- The patient is currently in sepsis and the suspected source is the tunneled catheter line.
- He has a history of full-body pain, including back pain, and underwent a cervical-thoracic-lumbar spine CT with contrast, which showed no gross abscess but did show lung abscesses.
- The patient still endorses back pain and weakness with hip flexion/adduction.
- There is a possibility of an epidural abscess, and an MRI with gadolinium has been discussed due to the patient's dialysis status.
- Neurology has been consulted regarding imaging recommendations, and it was determined that an MRI without contrast would not completely rule out an epidural abscess.
- The patient requires pain control, renal dialysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). He presented with malaise, was found down, and had hyperkalemia. He underwent emergent dialysis and was transferred to the floor. On the floor, he was noted to be hypotensive and developed sepsis. Blood cultures showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. A tunneled catheter line is suspected as the source of infection. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic pain, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35-40%, and a seizure disorder.

Potential Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis due to a suspected infected tunneled catheter line. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/Vanc) have been started, and blood cultures are pending. The source of infection needs to be addressed, and the line may need to be removed.

2. Epidural Abscess: The patient has back pain and weakness with hip flexion/adduction. A CT scan of the spine showed no gross abscess but revealed lung abscesses. There is a possibility of an epidural abscess, especially given the positive blood cultures. An MRI with gadolinium (GAD) is planned to evaluate for an epidural abscess. Neurology consultation is"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Pt was originally admitted after being found down for
   several days complaining of general malaise. After undergoing emergent
   dialysis he was transferred to the floor. On the floor pt was noted to
   be hypotensive. Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with
   + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending, bld cultures show 4/4 bottles GPC
   with speciation pending.
   - will f/u blood cultures for speciation
   - continue on broad spectrum with Zosyn/Vanc
   - will consult IR to place temporary line, as renal unable to place [**1-25**]
   scarring
   - given the possibility of the need for dialysis if pt receives MRI
   with GAD will likely keep line in tonight to receive dialysis
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Pt still
   endorses a lot of back pain and weakness with hip flexion/adduction.
   Given finding of abscesses, and +bld cultures it is possible pt may
   have epidural abscess. Discussed with radiology about using MRI with
   GAD given pt is on dialysis. Per Radiology there may still be a risk
   for NSF. Could image without GAD however would not completely rule out
   abscess. Will consult Neurology with regards to whether MRI w/o GAD
   coupled with CT scan w/ contast is enough to rule out epidural abscess.
   - Will consult Neurology regarding imaging recommendations
   - Attending notified of issue of MRI with GAD and NSF even with
   dialysis. Attending will call Neuroradiology attending regarding using
   GAD for MRI. Decision point of whether to go for MRI with GAD will be
   dependent on Neuro's imaging recommendations.
   - Pending result of MRI scan will consult Spine if abscess is noted
   - Morphine IV and PO for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent. Was found on admission to be
   hyperkalemic after being found down missing dialysis. Pt received
   dialysis on admission, Renal is currently following pt.
   - continue on HD
   - check daily lytes
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   - Digoxin level pending
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%) presenting with malaise, hypotension, and suspected gram-positive cocci (GPC) sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line. The patient has been admitted multiple times and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis, which is indicated by hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures for GPC. The suspected source of infection is the tunneled catheter line. Blood cultures are pending for speciation, and the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/Vanc). An Infectious Disease consultation has been requested to further evaluate and manage the sepsis.

2. Back Pain: The patient has been experiencing back pain since admission. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine with contrast showed no gross abscess but did reveal lung abscesses. Given the presence of abscesses and positive blood cultures, there is a possibility of an epidural abscess. Neurology has been consulted to determine the appropriate imaging recommendations, including whether an MRI with gadolinium (G"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Pt was originally admitted after being found down for
   several days complaining of general malaise. After undergoing emergent
   dialysis he was transferred to the floor. On the floor pt was noted to
   be hypotensive. Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with
   + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending, bld cultures show S aureus.  Line
   with 4+ GPC on gram stain
   - will f/u sensitivities
   - have been treating broad spectrum with Zosyn/Vanc. Will DC Zosyn
   today.
   - transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will follow cultures.
   -IR to place temp line
   -no vegetations seen on TTE
 will consider TEE
   -will draw serial blood cultures
   -chest CT today to evaluate lung findings
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Pt still
   endorses a lot of back pain and weakness with hip flexion/adduction.
   Given finding of abscesses, and +bld cultures it is possible pt may
   have epidural abscess. Discussed with radiology about using MRI with
   GAD given pt is on dialysis. Per Radiology there may still be a risk
   for NSF. Could image without GAD however would not completely rule out
   abscess. Have consulted Neurology with regards to whether MRI w/o GAD
   coupled with CT scan w/ contast is enough to rule out epidural abscess.
   - continue to try to clear C spine
 when mental status improved can
   clear with exam.
   - discuss with ortho today.
   - Morphine IV and PO for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent. Hyperkalemic to 6, s/p kayexelate.
   No EKG changes. Pt received dialysis on admission, Renal is currently
   following pt and he needs dialysis today. Will place line today (IR)
   - continue on HD today
   - check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID
   - going for US L leg this morning, then temporary HD cath placement.
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   - f/u digoxin level
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine. Has not been receiving Levetiracetam because gets with
   dialysis. Neuro concerned about nonepileptic seizures.
   -20 min EEG ordered
   -continue Keppra

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is dependent on hemodialysis (HD). He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. The patient presented with malaise, back pain, and was found down. He was initially treated for suspected gastrointestinal perforation sepsis (GPC) from his HD line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). Blood cultures showed Staphylococcus aureus, and the line was found to have 4+ growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC). The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/Vanc) and is scheduled for a chest CT to evaluate lung findings. He has a history of chronic pain and weakness with hip flexion/adduction. A C/T/L spine CT showed no gross abscess but did reveal cavitary lung lesions. The patient continues to experience back pain and weakness. There is a concern for possible epidural abscess. Neurology is consulted regarding imaging options, including an MRI with gadolinium contrast, which may pose a risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). The patient's serum potassium level is elevated at 6.1, and he received kayexelate for hyperkalemia. He is currently on dialysis and needs temporary HD catheter placement"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%, back pain, malaise, and hypotension. He was initially admitted for suspected graft versus host disease (GVHD) sepsis from hemodialysis line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). On the floor, the patient developed hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with positive blood cultures, and pulmonary abscess, indicating sepsis. The suspected source of infection is the tunneled catheter line. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/Vanc), and the tunneled line has been removed for culture analysis. A temporary dialysis catheter needs to be placed, and serial blood cultures will be drawn. A chest CT will be performed to evaluate lung findings.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis due to suspected tunnelled catheter line infection. It is crucial to monitor vital signs closely and administer appropriate antibiotics based on culture sensitivity results.
2. Back pain: The patient's back pain could potentially be caused by an epidural abscess, especially considering the presence of lung abscesses"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Pt was originally admitted after being found down for
   several days complaining of general malaise. After undergoing emergent
   dialysis he was transferred to the floor. On the floor pt was noted to
   be hypotensive. Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with
   + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending, bld cultures show S aureus.  Line
   with 4+ GPC on gram stain
   - will f/u sensitivities
   - continue on broad spectrum with Zosyn/Vanc. Could dc zosyn.
   - transplant surgery will removed HD line today
   -IR to place temp line
   -no vegetations seen on TTE
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Pt still
   endorses a lot of back pain and weakness with hip flexion/adduction.
   Given finding of abscesses, and +bld cultures it is possible pt may
   have epidural abscess. Discussed with radiology about using MRI with
   GAD given pt is on dialysis. Per Radiology there may still be a risk
   for NSF. Could image without GAD however would not completely rule out
   abscess. Have consulted Neurology with regards to whether MRI w/o GAD
   coupled with CT scan w/ contast is enough to rule out epidural abscess.
   - continue to try to clear C spine
   - Morphine IV and PO for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent. Hyperkalemic to 6, s/p kayexelate.
   No EKG changes. Pt received dialysis on admission, Renal is currently
   following pt and he needs dialysis today. Will place line today (IR)
   - continue on HD today
   - check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   - f/u digoxin level
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine. Has not been receiving Levetiracetam because gets with
   dialysis. Neuro concerned about nonepileptic seizures.
   -20 min EEG ordered
   .
   ##. FEN: NPO, S&S recommends place NGT
   hyperkalemia-rec'd kayexelate for K of 6.1. Will f/u am K

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). He was found down and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. The patient was transferred from the floor for suspicion of gram-positive cocci (GPC) sepsis from his hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis, suspected to be caused by the tunneled catheter line. Blood cultures show Staphylococcus aureus, and the line has 4+ GPC on gram stain. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/Vanc) are being continued, and the HD line will be removed today. A temporary line will be placed by interventional radiology (IR).
2. Back Pain: The patient has back pain, and a CT scan with contrast showed no gross abscess but did show lung abscesses. There is a possibility of an epidural abscess. An MRI with gadolinium is preferred, but there may be a risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) due to the patient's dialysis. A consultation has been made with neurology regarding imaging options to rule out an epidural abscess.
3. ESRD: The patient is currently HD dependent and hyperkalemic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with GPC bacteremia and sepsis. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection caused by Gram-positive cocci bacteria. This can lead to further spread of the infection and organ damage if not effectively treated.

2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys. This can result in organ dysfunction or failure.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. If left untreated, this can progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.

5. Diffuse Pain: The patient complains of back pain and diffuse musculoskeletal pain. If the underlying cause is not identified and treated, it may persist or worsen, affecting the patient's quality of life.

6. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient's poor control of swallow function may necessitate placement of a nasogastric tube. If this is not managed appropriately, it can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia or other gastrointestinal complications.

7. Seizures: The patient is on"

   Imaging: CT head:
   1. No hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
   2. Unchanged parenchymal involutional changes and chronic small vessel
   ischemic disease.
   3. Increase in the ethmoid airspace opacification and maxillary
   airspace
   opacification with some aerosolized secretions; however, this should be
   taken
   within the context of patient's known intubated status.
   CT Chest
   1. There are multiple, cavitated lesions in both lungs, predominantly
   in the
   left upper lobe, measuring up to 23 x 20 mm, likely representing septic
   emboli
   and multiple cavitated abscesses from the known Staph aureus sepsis.
   The
   differential diagnosis includes cavitating metastases.
   2. Almost complete atelectasis of the right lower lobe with
   obliteration of at
   least two of the segmental bronchi of the right lower lobe. There is
   moderate
   amount of airway secretions.
   3. Multiple borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, which are
   likely
   reactive in nature.
   4. Small pericardial effusion.
   5. Multiple bilateral rib fractures and a right non-healed scapular
   fracture.
   6. Multiple bilateral renal cysts, which might represent multicystic
   kidney
   disease secondary to dialysis or polycystic kidney disease. Some of the
   cysts
   are simple, others are complex in nature and especially one large cyst
   in the
   left kidneys warrants correlation with ultrasound or MRI.
   7. The gallbladder is significantly distended and filled with sludge.
   There
   are at least three rim-calcified gallstones.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Pt was originally admitted after being found down for
   several days complaining of general malaise. After undergoing emergent
   dialysis he was transferred to the floor. On the floor pt was noted to
   be hypotensive. Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with
   + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending, bld cultures show S aureus.  Line
   with S. aureus. White count continues to trend up. Low grade fever to
   100.1.
   - will f/u sensitivities
   - On cefepime (day 1) and nafcillin (day 4)- need to confirm with ID
   how long course of therapy is
   - transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will follow cultures.
   -[**Month (only) 60**] potentially need TEE to further evaluate for vegetations; Nothing
   on TTE; Will discuss further with cards
   -needs LP when more stable to evaluate for seeding to meninges
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT
   -will draw serial blood cultures
   -f/u final read of chest CT to evaluate pulmonary abscesses (likely
   represent septic emboli per prelim report).
   -f/u sputum cultures
   -appreciate ID recs
   .
   ## Respiratory failure: Hypoxia secondary to seizure, pt was intubated
   last night
    -ABG shows 7.31/59/114/28. Pt likely has chronic respiratory acidosis
   with some level of acute acidosis. Will increase RR to 30 and recheck
   ABG.
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - continue to try to clear C spine
 have already spoken with
   neurosurg. Pt is more awake on rounds and they will see him today.
   - Morphine IV and PO for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed yesterday, but no
   fluid removed [**1-25**]  hypotension
   - continue on HD today
   - check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID

   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure last night, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -20 min EEG ordered and read is pending

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with malaise, back pain, and was found hypotensive. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%). He was initially admitted for suspected generalized paresis of the cerebellum (GPC) sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient's current assessment includes the following:
1. Seizure, without status epilepticus: The patient experienced a grand mal seizure last night, which resulted in hypoxia and required stat intubation.
2. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient is experiencing acute pain due to various reasons, including his recent seizure, as well as chronic pain related to his medical conditions.
3. Renal failure, end stage (ESRD): The patient is dependent on hemodialysis (HD) for renal function, as indicated by his elevated creatinine levels and history of ESRD.
4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to the presence of S. aureus in his blood cultures, along with hypotension and leukocytosis. The source of sepsis is suspected to be the tunneled catheter line.

 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Pt was originally admitted after being found down for
   several days complaining of general malaise. After undergoing emergent
   dialysis he was transferred to the floor. On the floor pt was noted to
   be hypotensive. Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with
   + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending, bld cultures show S aureus.  Line
   with S. aureus. White count continues to trend up. Low grade fever to
   100.1.
   - will f/u sensitivities
   - On cefepime (day 1) and nafcillin (day 4)- need to confirm with ID
   how long course of therapy is
   - transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will follow cultures.
   -needs TEE today to evaluate for cardiac vegetations
   -needs LP when more stable to evaluate for seeding to meninges
   -will draw serial blood cultures
   -f/u final read of chest CT to evaluate pulmonary abscesses (likely
   represent septic emboli per prelim report).
   -ID recommended sputum cx, and to add levaquin if deterioriates or GNR
   .
   ## Respiratory failure: Hypoxia secondary to seizure, pt was intubated
   last night
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Pt still
   endorses a lot of back pain and weakness with hip flexion/adduction.
   Given finding of abscesses, and +bld cultures it is possible pt may
   have epidural abscess. Discussed with radiology about using MRI with
   GAD given pt is on dialysis. Per Radiology there may still be a risk
   for NSF. Could image without GAD however would not completely rule out
   abscess. Have consulted Neurology with regards to whether MRI w/o GAD
   coupled with CT scan w/ contast is enough to rule out epidural abscess.
   - continue to try to clear C spine
 when mental status improved can
   clear with exam.
   - Morphine IV and PO for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed yesterday, but no
   fluid removed
   - continue on HD today
   - check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID
   #? AV fistula in Left femoral artery/vein
   - going for US L leg this morning -  negative for AV fistula
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine. On IV keppra. Neuro concerned about nonepileptic
   seizures.
   -20 min EEG ordered
   -continue Keppra
   .
   ##. FEN: NPO, S&S recommends place NGT.   If MS improved after HD, may
   be able to use PO intake.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%). The patient presented with generalized malaise and was found down, initially presenting with hyperkalemia and back pain. He was transferred to the floor for suspected generalized paresthesia and chills (GPC) sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line, and subsequently developed hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has leukocytosis with positive blood cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus, indicating a possible source of sepsis from the tunneled catheter line. The patient is currently on cefepime and nafcillin, with plans to follow sensitivities and remove the tunneled HD catheter. Additional tests, such as TEE for cardiac vegetations, LP for meningitis evaluation, and serial blood cultures, are recommended.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced hypoxia secondary to a grand mal seizure and was intubated last night. Mechanical ventilation is currently being provided.

3. Back pain: The patient reports full-body pain, specifically back pain. A CT scan with contrast showed no gross abscess"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI), non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%), and chronic pain. He presented to the hospital with malaise and was found down, initially hyperkalemic with back pain. The patient underwent emergent dialysis and was transferred to the floor, where he was noted to be hypotensive.

Subsequently, the patient developed respiratory failure, likely secondary to a seizure, and was intubated last night. He also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, suspected to be due to a tunnelled catheter line infection, as indicated by positive blood cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is currently on cefepime and nafcillin for sepsis.

The patient also has chronic pain, ESRD, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a history of seizure disorder. He is currently on morphine for pain control, sevelamer for phosphate control, and Digoxin for heart failure management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if the underlying cause, such as the seizure, is not appropriately managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis could worsen if the source of infection, suspected to be the tunneled catheter"

   3. Increase in the ethmoid airspace opacification and maxillary
   airspace
   opacification with some aerosolized secretions; however, this should be

   high, off the film.
   Chest CT: 1. There are multiple, cavitated lesions in both lungs,
   predominantly in the

   emboli
   and multiple cavitated abscesses from the known Staph aureus sepsis.
   The
   differential diagnosis includes cavitating metastases.
   2. Almost complete atelectasis of the right lower lobe with
   obliteration of at
   least two of the segmental bronchi of the right lower lobe. There is
   moderate
   amount of airway secretions.

   5. Multiple bilateral rib fractures and a right non-healed scapular
   fracture.
   6. Multiple bilateral renal cysts, which might represent multicystic
   kidney
   disease secondary to dialysis or polycystic kidney disease. Some of the
   cysts
   are simple, others are complex in nature and especially one large cyst
   in the
   left kidneys warrants correlation with ultrasound or MRI.

   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Pt was originally admitted after being found down for
   several days complaining of general malaise. After undergoing emergent
   dialysis he was transferred to the floor. On the floor pt was noted to
   be hypotensive. Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with
   + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending, bld cultures show S aureus.  Line
   with S. aureus. White count continues to trend up. Low grade fever to
   100.1.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI), non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%), and seizure disorder. The patient presented with generalized malaise and was found down, leading to emergent dialysis and transfer to the floor. On the floor, the patient developed hypotension and was transferred back to the ICU. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has multiple comorbidities, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (acute), seizure (without status epilepticus), pain control (acute pain and chronic pain), renal failure (end-stage), and back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to the presence of fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, and positive blood cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus. The source of infection may be the tunneled catheter line. The patient is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, and further monitoring of blood cultures and sensitivity is planned.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to the seizure episode, resulting in hypoxia. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator will be considered when the patient is stable.

   several days complaining of general malaise. After undergoing emergent
   dialysis he was transferred to the floor. On the floor pt was noted to
   be hypotensive. Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with
   + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending, bld cultures show S aureus.  Line
   with S. aureus. White count continues to trend up. Low grade fever to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%). He presented with malaise, was found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He underwent emergent dialysis and was transferred to the floor, where he developed hypotension. Blood cultures showed Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and he was diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to a tunneled catheter line. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, which occurred after a seizure. He also has multiple pulmonary abscesses and cavitated lesions in both lungs, indicating septic emboli and multiple cavitated abscesses from known S. aureus sepsis. The patient has a history of seizures and chronic pain. His renal function is compromised, and he is dependent on dialysis. He also has a small pericardial effusion, multiple bilateral rib fractures, a right non-healed scapular fracture, and multiple bilateral renal cysts. A CT scan of the head showed no hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect. He has a significantly distended gallbladder filled with sludge and at least three rim-calcified gallstones. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and further tests are planned, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), lumbar puncture (LP), and MRI. The patient's pain control, seizure management, ESRD, sepsis, respiratory failure, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy are being addressed."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3993**] continues to require fluid boluses for his marginal BP but
   has no worsening O2 needs on current level of support/ sedation. His
   secretions are copious in keeping with resolving septic emboli in his
   lung. He will need a TEE on [**2117-8-31**] and a decision regarding need for
   spine imaging (? epidural collection) by neurology /ID staff. We will
   also attempt to transition to CPAP/ PSV today if possible.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%). He presented with general malaise, hypotension, and was found down. The patient has a history of being on dialysis and was transferred to the ICU for suspected gram-positive cocci sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has leukocytosis with positive blood cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus. The source of infection is suspected to be the tunneled catheter line. The patient is on meropenem and nafcillin. Cultures are pending, and the tunneled HD catheter has been removed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated last night due to hypoxia secondary to seizure. Weaning off the ventilator is planned.
3. Back pain: The patient has full-body pain, specifically back pain. A CT scan of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine showed no gross abscess but did show lung abscesses. Pain management with morphine IV and PO is ongoing. An MRI while intubated is being considered.
4. ESRD: The patient is HD dependent and underwent dialysis yesterday. He will continue on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY). He presented with malaise, was found down, and initially had hyperkalemia with back pain. The patient is currently in the ICU for suspected generalized pustular candidiasis (GPC) sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). He is intubated after experiencing a seizure and has mild respiratory acidosis on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient also has several blood cultures and line culture pending, with MSSA identified in the blood cultures. He is on nafcillin (day 6) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 2) for suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient's WBC count continues to trend up, indicating ongoing infection. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, seizure, pain control, renal failure, sepsis, and back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including hypotension, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures for MSSA. There is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). He presented with malaise, back pain, and was found down. Initial laboratory results showed hyperkalemia. He was transferred to the ICU for suspected sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient has several medical problems including respiratory failure, seizure disorder, chronic pain, renal failure, sepsis, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure and has purulent secretions. There is a concern about his volume status and the need for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) tomorrow. The plan is to wean the ventilator and possibly extubate after the TEE.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis including hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The source of sepsis is suspected to be the tunneled catheter line. Antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending. Further evaluation with TEE and MRI is needed to guide the treatment.
3. ESRD: The patient is HD dependent and experienced hypotension during dialysis. CVVH is planned, but low blood pressures are a concern. Phosphate control measures are ongoing.
4. Non-ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is 35-40%, and there is severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to mid-septal, anterior, and inferior segments. Monitoring fluid status and continuing on Digoxin are part of the management.
5. Seizure Disorder: The patient had a seizure last night, and no oxcarbazepine was given due to the risk of aspiration. The plan is to continue on home regimen of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine now that the patient has a nasogastric tube (NGT).
6. R arm swelling and discomfort: An X-ray of the shoulder and consideration of ultrasound to rule out clot are planned.
7. Back Pain: The patient's back pain is being managed with pain control medications, and further evaluation with MRI of the spine is scheduled.
8. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is dependent on HD. Renal failure management includes CVVH, electrolyte monitoring, and phosphate control.
9. Tunnelled HD catheter removal: The transplant surgery has removed the tunneled HD catheter, and follow-up cultures will be done.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3993**] is tolerating CPAP/ PSV with continued copious secretion
   output. He will get a MRI today of his spine and XRay
s of his shoulder
   too given pain at the site. He will then have C Spine cleared and
   possibly repeat therapeutic bronchoscopy today/ tomorrow to help with
   secretion clearance. HD/ CVVH will be started today/ tomorrow too per
   renal recs. He will need a TEE before we make attempts at extubation.
   There have been no further seizures at this time and I believe his
   mental status is also better with current sedation needs.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY). He presented to the ICU with a 3-day history of malaise, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. The patient was initially hyperkalemic and had back pain. He was transferred from the floor for suspicion of gastrointestinal perforation with sepsis (GPC) due to hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis, with suspected source being the tunneled catheter line. Blood cultures show methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and the patient is on nafcillin and levofloxacin for MSSA and possible aspiration pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection after a seizure. He has purulent secretions and concerns about volume status. He is maintained on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) with mild respiratory acidosis.
3. Back pain: The patient has full-body pain, including back pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical-thoracic-lumbar spine showed no gross abscess but revealed lung abscesses.
4. ESRD: The patient is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is fever. The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%), and back pain. The patient was found down and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for suspicion of graft pseudomonas sepsis from hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis due to suspected tunnelled catheter line infection. Blood cultures show methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and the patient is already on antibiotics. Further treatment will depend on the results of the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

2. Respiratory failure: The patient intubated after experiencing a seizure. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has mild respiratory acidosis. Weaning of the ventilator should be done on a case-by-case basis.

3. Back pain: The patient has full-body pain, including back pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical-thoracic-lumbar spine showed no gross abscess but"

The patient presented with malaise, was found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He was transferred from the floor to the ICU for suspected gram-positive cocci (GPC) sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute seizure without status epilepticus, pain control (acute and chronic pain), ESRD, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and non-ischemic CMY. 

In terms of respiratory failure, the patient was intubated for airway protection after experiencing a seizure. He continues to have copious purulent secretions overnight. The patient's respiratory acidosis improved slightly after switching to assisted control ventilation (ACV), but he was unable to wean off the ventilator overnight.

   bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending ALL CX NGTD FOR PAST 48 HOURS, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low grade fever
   to 100.1.
   - On nafcillin (day 5) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 2) for ?
   aspiration pna as found down. will need to confirm with ID how long
   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE and MRI results
   -will eventually require TEE; discussed yesterday
   -needs LP when more stable to evaluate for seeding to meninges.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday - no evidence of epidural abscess
   on prelim read, but will follow up on final read.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.

   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -Unable to wean vent overnight - increased PS without significant
   improvement in CO2.
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   -further shoulder x-rays taken yesterday per radiology recs.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Morphine IV and PO for pain control.
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started yesterday, continuing into this morning.  Goal fluid balance
   even.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   .
   # R arm swelling and discomfort: xray shoulder, consider u/s to r/o
   clot

   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -20 min EEG ordered - read pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) after myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. The patient presented with malaise, was found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for suspicion of Gram-positive cocci sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, and there is evidence of lung abscesses on imaging. He also experienced a seizure and is being treated with antiepileptic drugs. The patient has ESRD and is HD dependent, with ongoing fluid balance concerns. There are other comorbidities mentioned in the note, including chronic pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and an elevated INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures suggest ongoing sepsis, likely originating from the tunneled catheter line. Cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires ongoing ventilatory support. Copious purulent secretions overnight indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He presented with malaise, hyperkalemia, and back pain. The patient was initially suspected to have sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). He is currently intubated for airway protection after experiencing a seizure. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, seizure, pain control, renal failure, and sepsis.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with positive blood cultures, and pulmonary abscess. The suspected source of infection is the tunneled catheter line. He is currently receiving antibiotics for MSSA and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection after the seizure. He continues to have copious purulent secretions and is awaiting a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). There is mild respiratory acidosis on pressure support ventilation (PSV), and he has been switched to assist-control (AC) ventilation overnight with slight improvement"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with +
   bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending ALL CX NGTD FOR PAST 48 HOURS, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low grade fever
   to 100.1.
   - On nafcillin (day 5) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 2) for ?
   aspiration pna as found down. will need to confirm with ID how long
   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE and MRI results
   -will require TEE; discussed yesterday
   -needs LP to evaluate for seeding to meninges, as per ID; but has been
   on antibiotics for days now, wondering if it will change management.
   Will discuss further with ID
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday - no evidence of epidural abscess
   on prelim read, but will follow up on final read.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no surveillance cx for today given 48hrs
   NGTD.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -appreciate ID recs .
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -Unable to wean vent overnight - increased PS without significant
   improvement in CO2.
   -Will work more to wean after TEE
   -Will do therapeutic bronch /cultures today to help with purulent
   secretions
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control.
   - f/u final read of MRI of back to r/o epidural abscess
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started yesterday, continuing into this morning.  Goal fluid balance
   even.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -20 min EEG ordered - read pending.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.5 - stably elevated for past 2 days, likely [**1-25**] abx and npo.
   #Hypotension: currently on Levophed. Does not seem to be extremely
   responsive to fluids. Likely [**1-25**] sedation.
   - wean levophed as tolerated

 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with +
   bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending ALL CX NGTD FOR PAST 48 HOURS, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low grade fever
   to 100.1.
   - On nafcillin (day 5) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 2) for ?
   aspiration pna as found down. will need to confirm with ID how long
   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE and MRI results
   -will require TEE; discussed yesterday
   -needs LP to evaluate for seeding to meninges, as per ID; but has been
   on antibiotics for days now, wondering if it will change management.
   Will discuss further with ID
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday - no evidence of epidural abscess
   on prelim read, but will follow up on final read.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no surveillance cx for today given 48hrs
   NGTD.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -appreciate ID recs .
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -Unable to wean vent overnight - increased PS without significant
   improvement in CO2.
   -Will work more to wean after TEE
   -Will do therapeutic bronch /cultures today to help with purulent
   secretions
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control.
   - f/u final read of MRI of back to r/o epidural abscess
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started yesterday, continuing into this morning.  Goal fluid balance
   even.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -20 min EEG ordered - read pending.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.5 - stably elevated for past 2 days, likely [**1-25**] abx and npo.
   #Hypotension: currently on Levophed. Does not seem to be extremely
   responsive to fluids. Likely [**1-25**] sedation.
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds.  IVF boluses for hypotension. Will continue to
   follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with +
   bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending ALL CX NGTD FOR PAST 48 HOURS, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low grade fever
   to 100.1.
   - On nafcillin (day 5) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 2) for ?
   aspiration pna as found down. will need to confirm with ID how long
   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE and MRI results
   -will require TEE; discussed yesterday
   -needs LP to evaluate for seeding to meninges, as per ID; but has been
   on antibiotics for days now, wondering if it will change management.
   Will discuss further with ID
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday - no evidence of epidural abscess
   on prelim read, but will follow up on final read.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no surveillance cx for today given 48hrs
   NGTD.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -appreciate ID recs .
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -Unable to wean vent overnight - increased PS without significant
   improvement in CO2.
   -Will work more to wean after TEE
   -Will do therapeutic bronch /cultures today to help with purulent
   secretions
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control.
   - f/u final read of MRI of back to r/o epidural abscess
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started yesterday, continuing into this morning.  Goal fluid balance
   even.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -20 min EEG ordered - read pending.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.

   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.5 - stably elevated for past 2 days, likely [**1-25**] abx and npo.
   #Hypotension: currently on Levophed. Does not seem to be extremely
   responsive to fluids. Likely [**1-25**] sedation.
   - wean levophed as tolerated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of HD dependent ESRD, CAD post-myocardial infarction, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. He presented with malaise, found down and initially hyperkalemic, and had back pain. The patient was transferred from the floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension responsive to IV fluids.

24-hour events include bronchoscopy, MRI, LP, PICC line placement, and various interventions to manage respiratory failure, pain, and sepsis. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing hypotension, respiratory distress, and elevated INR. He is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, norepinephrine, KCl, calcium gluconate, and midazolam.

The patient has several lab abnormalities including leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and renal dysfunction. Cultures are pending to identify the source of infection. The patient's pain, nutrition, and electrolyte imbalances require ongoing monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, hypoglycemia, and leukocytosis suggest ongoing sepsis, likely secondary to the tunneled HD catheter line. Blood cultures show MSSA, and antibiotics have been initiated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to airway protection and ongoing respiratory distress"

   -LP performed yesterday
 counts normal, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday
 cannot rule out atypical osteo,
   but no epidural seen.  Also recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
   will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive cultures so far over past 6
   days.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -ID recs this morning:  continue nafcillin, follow up cultures from
   sacral swab
 add HSV/VZV to CSF culture.  Would not recommend empiric
   antiviral treatment at this point.  Plan to switch to cefazolin when on
   regular dialysis, renal function more stable.

   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with +
   bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending ALL CX NGTD FOR PAST 48 HOURS, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low grade fever
   to 100.1.
   - On nafcillin (day 6) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 3) for ?
   aspiration pna as found down. will need to confirm with ID how long
   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE and MRI results
   -TTE not done, will need to wait until collar removed.
   -LP performed yesterday
 counts normal, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday
 cannot rule out atypical osteo,
   but no epidural seen.  Also recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
   will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive cultures so far over past 6
   days.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -ID recs this morning:  continue nafcillin, follow up cultures from
   sacral swab
 add HSV/VZV to CSF culture.  Would not recommend empiric
   antiviral treatment at this point.  Plan to switch to cefazolin when on
   regular dialysis, renal function more stable.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -Unable to wean vent overnight - increased PS without significant
   improvement in CO2.
   -Will work more to wean after TEE

   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able. Will lighten
   sedation today and try to do a better exam
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
 required increased fentanyl and
   Versed yesterday for pain, discomfort.

   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He was admitted with malaise, found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He is suspected to have gastrointestinal perforation sepsis from his hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient underwent various procedures including bronchoscopy, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed no significant findings except for possible osteomyelitis. He had a seizure and required intubation for airway protection. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and cardiac medications.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, and he requires assistance for breathing. His blood cultures show methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and he has been started on nafcillin. He also has elevated white blood cell count, low-grade fever, and respiratory acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis including hypotension, leukocytosis with elevated white blood cell count, and positive blood cultures. The suspected source of infection is the tunnelled cath"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with +
   bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending, but all negative for past several
   days, bld cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low
   grade fever to 100.1 yesterday, none overnight.
   - On nafcillin (day 6) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 3) for ?
   aspiration pna as found down. will need to confirm with ID how long
   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE results
   -TTE not done, will need to wait until collar removed.
   -LP performed yesterday
 counts normal, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday
 cannot rule out atypical osteo,
   but no epidural seen.  Also recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
   will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive cultures so far over past 6
   days.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -ID recs this morning:  continue nafcillin, follow up cultures from
   sacral swab
 add HSV/VZV to CSF culture.  Would not recommend empiric
   antiviral treatment at this point.  Plan to switch to cefazolin when on
   regular dialysis, renal function more stable.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -Unable to wean vent overnight - increased PS without significant
   improvement in CO2.
   -Will work more to wean after TEE
   -Bronch performed yesterday, BAL sent.
 Gram Stain:  >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
   .
   #Hypotension: currently on Levophed, 0.1.  Likely secondary to
   persistent infection, lung abscesses.  Could also be due to cardiac
   valvular seeding, unable to perform TEE to this point.  (TTE negative
   for vegetations).
   - wean levophed as tolerated
 unable to wean yesterday.
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able. Will lighten
   sedation today and try to do a better exam if able.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
 required increased fentanyl and
   Versed yesterday for pain, discomfort.
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   -renal following.
   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesisof the basal to mid
   septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -still awaiting final read on EEG.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.5 - stably elevated for past 2 days, likely [**1-25**] abx and npo.
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds.  IVF boluses for hypotension. Will continue to
   follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hemodialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. The patient presented with malaise, was found down, and initially had hyperkalemia and back pain. He was transferred from the floor for suspicion of gastrointestinal perforation sepsis (GPC) from the hemodialysis line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient underwent various procedures including a bronchoscopy, which showed purulent secretions but no microorganisms. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) could not be performed due to the need to remove the collar before the procedure. An MRI of the spine was also done, showing no evidence of epidural abscess but cannot rule out atypical osteomyelitis. A lumbar puncture was performed with normal counts and cultures pending.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit), blood pressure ranging from 130/61 mmHg to 148/92 mmHg, heart rate between 86 and 126 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with +
   bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending ALL CX NGTD FOR PAST 48 HOURS, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low grade fever
   to 100.1.
   - On nafcillin (day 6) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 3) for ?
   aspiration pna as found down. will need to confirm with ID how long
   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE and MRI results
   -TTE not done, will need to wait until collar removed.
   -LP performed yesterday
 counts normal, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday
 cannot rule out atypical osteo,
   but no epidural seen.  Also recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
   will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive cultures so far over past 6
   days.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -ID recs this morning:  continue nafcillin, follow up cultures from
   sacral swab
 add HSV/VZV to CSF culture.  Would not recommend empiric
   antiviral treatment at this point.  Plan to switch to cefazolin when on
   regular dialysis, renal function more stable.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -Unable to wean vent overnight - increased PS without significant
   improvement in CO2.
   -Will work more to wean after TEE
   -Bronch performed yesterday, BAL performed.
   >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
 required increased fentanyl and
   Versed yesterday for pain, discomfort.
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   -renal following.
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -still awaiting final read on EEG.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.5 - stably elevated for past 2 days, likely [**1-25**] abx and npo.
   #Hypotension: currently on Levophed. Does not seem to be extremely
   responsive to fluids. Likely [**1-25**] sedation.
   - wean levophed as tolerated
 unable to wean yesterday.
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds.  IVF boluses for hypotension. Will continue to
   follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.

   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE and MRI results
   -TTE not done, will need to wait until collar removed.
   -LP performed yesterday
 counts normal, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday
 cannot rule out atypical osteo,
   but no epidural seen.  Also recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
   will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive cultures so far over past 6
   days.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -appreciate ID recs .
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -Unable to wean vent overnight - increased PS without significant
   improvement in CO2.
   -Will work more to wean after TEE
   -Bronch performed yesterday, BAL performed.
   >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
 required increased fentanyl and
   Versed yesterday for pain, discomfort.
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   -renal following.
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -still awaiting final read on EEG.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.

","Summary:
This is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. The patient presented with malaise, hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia, back pain, and was found down. He was initially suspected to have gram-positive cocci sepsis from the hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis, likely due to a suspected tunnelled catheter line infection. Blood cultures show methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and the patient is being treated with nafcillin and levofloxacin. Line cultures are pending.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection after a seizure and is experiencing copious purulent secretions. The patient is awaiting a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to identify the causative organism.
3. Back Pain: The patient has back pain, which may be due to a lung abscess seen on imaging. The patient's shoulder X"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with malaise, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. He was found down and suspected to have sepsis from his hemodialysis (HD) line. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing respiratory failure, MSSA bacteremia, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/MSSA Bacteremia: The patient is already on nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia, but continuous monitoring and antibiotic therapy will be necessary to control the infection and prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his critical condition and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of his respiratory status, daily weaning trials, and infection control measures will be crucial to improve his chances of extubation.
3. ESRD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis support. Frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid balance will be necessary to manage his renal replacement therapy effectively.
4. Other ICU Issues: The patient has multiple other issues mentioned in the ICU resident note, which need to be addressed appropriately, including nutrition, glycemic control, line management, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). He was admitted to the ICU due to suspected gram-positive cocci (GPC) sepsis from his hemodialysis (HD) line and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including MSSA bacteremia, respiratory failure, and ESRD. He is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, such as antibiotics (nafcillin), respiratory support, and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient's vital signs show fever, low blood pressure, and an elevated heart rate. His oxygen saturation is within normal limits, but his respiratory rate is slightly increased. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, warm skin, and neurologic impairment with unresponsiveness and absence of movement or tone.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, low sodium, low potassium, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has a history of malaise, back pain, and a previous myocardial infarction. Imaging studies, including an MRI of the spine, have shown no evidence of infection.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low grade fever
   to 100.1 yesterday, none overnight.
   - On nafcillin (day 7) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 4) for ?
   aspiration pna as found down. will need to confirm with ID how long
   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE results
   -TTE not done, will need to wait until collar removed.
   -LP performed 2d ago
 counts normal, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday
 cannot rule out atypical osteo,
   but no epidural seen.  Also recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
   will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive cultures so far over past 6
   days.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -ID recs this morning:  continue nafcillin, follow up cultures from
   sacral swab
 add HSV/VZV to CSF culture.  Would not recommend empiric
   antiviral treatment at this point.  Plan to switch to cefazolinwhen on
   regular dialysis, renal function more stable.
   .
   #? Ileus: Pt had feculent material from NGT  overnight. NGT placed on
   suction and has not had feculent material in past few hours. Surgery
   consulted and KUB and CT abd have initial reads which are reassuring s
   ileus or obstruction
   -will f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 458**] recs

   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -placed on psv trial this am
   .
   #Hypotension: currently on Levophed, 0.1.  Likely secondary to
   persistent infection, lung abscesses.  Could also be due to cardiac
   valvular seeding, unable to perform TEE to this point.  (TTE negative
   for vegetations).
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able. Will lighten
   sedation today and try to do a better exam if able.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
 required increased fentanyl and
   Versed yesterday for pain, discomfort.
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo

   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -still awaiting final read on EEG.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He presents with malaise, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and leukocytosis, indicating sepsis. He has MSSA sepsis and is currently being treated with nafcillin and levofloxacin. The patient also has lung abscesses, which may be the source of infection. Blood cultures are pending, and the tunnelled catheter line is suspected as the possible source of infection. 

The patient is intubated for airway protection after experiencing a seizure. He has copious purulent secretions and is on mechanical ventilation. TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) is planned to assess for cardiac valvular seeding, but it has not been performed yet due to the patient's altered mental status. 

The patient's back pain is ongoing, and he underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast, which showed no gross abscess but did reveal lung abscesses. He is wearing a cervical collar, and attempts to clear it have been unsuccessful due to his altered mental status. 

The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) and is HD dependent."

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low grade fever
   to 100.1 yesterday, none overnight.
   - On nafcillin (day 7) for MSSA, Levaquin and Flagyl discontinued
   today.
   -TTE not done, will need to wait until collar removed.
   -LP performed 2d ago
 counts normal, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive cultures so far over past 6
   days.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -ID recs this morning:  continue nafcillin, follow up cultures from
   sacral swab
 add HSV/VZV to CSF culture.  Would not recommend empiric
   antiviral treatment at this point.  Plan to switch to cefazolinwhen on
   regular dialysis, renal function more stable.
   .
   #? Ileus: Pt had feculent material from NGT  overnight. NGT placed on
   suction and has not had feculent material in past few hours. Surgery
   consulted and KUB and CT abd have initial reads which are reassuring s
   ileus or obstruction
   -NGT now draining bilious fluid, small residuals.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -placed on psv trial this am
   -continue intubation while mental status remains poor and secretions
   remain.
   -continue to assess mental status daily with sedation wean.
   -SBT today.
   .
   #Hypotension: currently on Levophed, 0.1.  Likely secondary to
   persistent infection, lung abscesses.  Could also be due to cardiac
   valvular seeding, unable to perform TEE to this point.  (TTE negative
   for vegetations).
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able. Tried again
   yesterday, but mental status did not allow for adequate exam.  Seemed
   to report cervical spine tenderness.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
 required increased fentanyl and
   Versed yesterday for pain, discomfort.
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   -renal following.
   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.5 - stably elevated for past 2 days, likely [**1-25**] abx and npo.
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds currently off.  IVF boluses for hypotension. Will
   continue to follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.  Renal also
   following with CVVH protocol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He presented with malaise, was found down, and initially had hyperkalemia with back pain. The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA sepsis and is currently in the ICU for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has MSSA sepsis, which is currently being treated with nafcillin. Cultures are pending, and the source of infection may be a tunneled hemodialysis catheter line.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient was intubated for airway protection after a seizure. He continues to have copious purulent secretions and is on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) with mild respiratory acidosis. A tracheal examination (TEE) is planned.
3. Ileus: The patient had feculent material from the nasogastric tube (NGT) overnight. The NGT has been placed on suction, and there are small residuals. Surgery has been consulted, and imaging studies are reassuring, ruling out ileus or obstruction.
4. Hypotension: The patient is on levophed due to persistent infection and lung abscess"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased since yesterday,
   no fevers in 24 hours.
   - On nafcillin (day 7) for MSSA, Levaquin and Flagyl discontinued
   today.
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE.
   -LP performed 2d ago
 counts normal, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive blood cultures since [**8-25**].
   -sputum cx pos for MSSA from [**8-30**], no other organisms identified, other
   sputum cx still pending
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically ---Plan to
   switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function more
   stable
   -greatly appreciate ID recs
   .
   #? Ileus: Pt had feculent material from NGT  overnight. NGT placed on
   suction and has not had feculent material in past few hours. Surgery
   consulted and KUB and CT abd have initial reads which are reassuring s
   ileus or obstruction
   -NGT now draining bilious fluid, small residuals.
   -greatly appreciate surgery input
   -will restart tube feeds as studies reassuring
   -keppra currently IV but will switch back to PO once tolerating tube
   feeds for several hours
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -placed on psv trial this am
   -continue intubation while mental status remains poor and secretions
   remain.
   -continue to assess mental status daily with sedation wean.
   -SBT today.
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now also low pressures [**1-25**] cvvh
   - not on pressors at this point
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able. Tried again
   yesterday, but mental status did not allow for adequate exam.  Seemed
   to report cervical spine tenderness.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
 required increased fentanyl and
   Versed yesterday for pain, discomfort.
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   -renal following.
   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.5 - stably elevated for past 2 days, likely [**1-25**] abx and npo.
   -will trend
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds currently off.  IVF boluses for hypotension. Will
   continue to follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.  Renal also
   following with CVVH protocol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He presented with malaise, was found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. The patient was transferred from the floor for MSSA sepsis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis due to MSSA infection. The source of infection is suspected to be the tunneled catheter line. He is receiving nafcillin for MSSA, and other antibiotics have been discontinued.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection after a seizure. He continues to have copious purulent secretions overnight. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is pending to assess for vegetations. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV), and his respiratory acidosis has improved with assisted ventilation.

3. Ileus: The patient had feculent material from the nasogastric tube (NGT) overnight, which indicates a possible ileus. The NGT has been placed on suction, and bilious fluid is now draining, suggesting a partial resolution of the ileus.

4. Back Pain: The patient has full-body pain and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with malaise, back pain, and hyperkalemia. He was found down and initially suspected to have gonococcal sepsis from his hemodialysis (HD) line. He was transferred to the ICU for suspected sepsis and hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient has multiple comorbidities, including ESRD, CAD, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35-40%. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by MSSA bacteremia and lung abscesses. The patient is also experiencing ileus, as evidenced by the presence of bilious material from the nasogastric tube (NGT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/MSSA bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis. It is important to continue nafcillin treatment and monitor for signs of clinical improvement, such as fever curve and white blood cell count.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to MSSA bacteremia and lung abscesses. BAL with MSSA has been done, and nafcillin therapy is being continued. RSBI is good, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)"

   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased since yesterday,
   no fevers in 48 hours.
   - On nafcillin (day 8) for MSSA
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE.
   -LP performed, cultures pending.  Results obviously limited given
   multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive blood cultures since [**8-25**].
   -sputum cx pos for MSSA from [**8-30**] and [**8-31**]
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable
   -greatly appreciate ID recs

   suction and has not had feculent material in past few hours. Surgery
   consulted and KUB and CT abd have initial reads which are reassuring s
   ileus or obstruction

   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.

   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now also low pressures [**1-25**] cvvh. Yesterday req pressors after large
   fentanyl dose [**1-25**] tachypnea, presumed pain
   - not on pressors at this point
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able. Tried again
   yesterday, but mental status did not allow for adequate exam.  Seemed
   to report cervical spine tenderness.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo and epo

   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%). He presented with malaise, hypoglycemia, and back pain, and was found to be hyperkalemic. He was transferred from the floor for suspected MSSA sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, suspected sepsis, ileus, hypotension, and pain control. He has multiple comorbidities, including seizures, chronic kidney disease, and CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is still at risk for sepsis due to the presence of MSSA in the blood cultures. There is also a suspicion of a lung abscess.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection after a seizure. He continues to have copious purulent secretions, indicating ongoing respiratory distress.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension is likely secondary to persistent infection and lung abscesses. There may be a need for pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Ileus: The patient had feculent material from the NG tube overnight, suggesting ileus. However, it seems to have resolved after NGT placement on suction.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has ESRD and is currently"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Renal recs:  continue phoslo and renagel.  Continue Epo M/W/F while on
   CVVH.  Will increase ultrafiltration to negative 100 ml/hr.
   -ID recs:  continue nafcillin.  Recommend TEE if C-spine can be cleared
   - if not able to clear, recommend 6 weeks abx.  Follow up results of CT
   to assess for other possible infectious source.
   -SBT in am with RSBI 40.  Vent settings reduced from 14/5 to 10/5 PSV.
   -ABG on [**9-27**] - 7.36/37/142
   -Tube feeds remained with high residuals yesterday.
   -Overnight had an episode of significant pain with tachypnea.  Large
   amount of fentanyl given, pressure dropped, so Levophed was
   re-started.  Was able to wean back off Levophed after several hours.

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease, and a previous myocardial infarction. He presented with malaise, back pain, and was found to be hyperkalemic. He was transferred from the floor due to MSSA sepsis and now has several comorbidities including respiratory failure, ileus, hypotension, pain control issues, and ESRD.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis, suspected to be caused by the tunnelled catheter line. Blood cultures are pending, but MSSA has been identified. The patient is on nafcillin for MSSA.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection after a seizure. He continues to have copious purulent secretions overnight. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned, and the patient's respiratory acidosis on pressure support ventilation (PSV) has improved with the switch to assist control (AC) ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to persistent infection and lung abscesses. The use of CVVH has also contributed to low pressures.
4. Back Pain: The patient has full-body pain and specifically back pain. A CT scan of the cervical-thoracic-lumbar spine with contrast showed no gross abs"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Renal recs:  continue phoslo and renagel.  Continue Epo M/W/F while on
   CVVH.  Will increase ultrafiltration to negative 100 ml/hr.
   -ID recs:  continue nafcillin.  Recommend TEE if C-spine can be cleared
   - if not able to clear, recommend 6 weeks abx.  Follow up results of CT
   to assess for other possible infectious source.
   -SBT in am with RSBI 40.  Vent settings reduced from 14/5 to 10/5 PSV.
   -ABG on [**9-27**] - 7.36/37/142
   -Tube feeds remained with high residuals yesterday.
   -Overnight had an episode of significant pain with tachypnea.  Large
   amount of fentanyl given, pressure dropped, so Levophed was
   re-started.  Was able to wean back off Levophed after several hours.
   -Tolerated CVVH well - able to keep -100 cc/hour all day and overnight.

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased since yesterday,
   no fevers in 48 hours.
   - On nafcillin (day 8) for MSSA
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE.
   -LP performed, cultures pending.  Results obviously limited given
   multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive blood cultures since [**8-25**].
   -sputum cx pos for MSSA from [**8-30**] and [**8-31**]
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable
   -greatly appreciate ID recs
   .
   #? Ileus: Pt had feculent material from NGT  overnight. NGT placed on
   suction and has not had feculent material in past few hours. Surgery
   consulted and KUB and CT abd have initial reads which are reassuring s
   ileus or obstruction
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerated tube feeds yesterday
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -sbt today
   -consider extubation
   -tube feeds currently off
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now also low pressures [**1-25**] cvvh. Yesterday req pressors after large
   fentanyl dose [**1-25**] tachypnea, presumed pain
   - not on pressors at this point
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able. Tried again
   yesterday, but mental status did not allow for adequate exam.  Seemed
   to report cervical spine tenderness.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo and epo
   -renal following.
   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.5 - stably elevated for several days, likely [**1-25**] abx and npo.
   -will trend
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds currently off.  IVF boluses for hypotension. Will
   continue to follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.  Renal also
   following with CVVH protocol.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased since yesterday,
   no fevers in 48 hours.
   - On nafcillin (day 8) for MSSA
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE.
   -LP performed, cultures pending.  Results obviously limited given
   multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive blood cultures since [**8-25**].
   -sputum cx pos for MSSA from [**8-30**] and [**8-31**]
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable
   -greatly appreciate ID recs
   .
   #? Ileus: Pt had feculent material from NGT  overnight. NGT placed on
   suction and has not had feculent material in past few hours. Surgery
   consulted and KUB and CT abd have initial reads which are reassuring s
   ileus or obstruction
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerated tube feeds yesterday
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -sbt today
   -consider extubation
   -tube feeds currently off

   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now also low pressures [**1-25**] cvvh. Yesterday req pressors after large
   fentanyl dose [**1-25**] tachypnea, presumed pain
   - not on pressors at this point
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able. Tried again
   yesterday, but mental status did not allow for adequate exam.  Seemed
   to report cervical spine tenderness.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started 2 days ago, continuing.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo and epo
   -renal following.
   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He was admitted with malaise, back pain, and hypoglycemia. He was found to be hyperkalemic and initially had elevated blood cultures indicating MSSA sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and is dependent on dialysis. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, ileus, hypotension, back pain, ESRD, and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis. The source of infection may be the tunneled catheter line, as indicated by positive blood cultures for MSSA. Monitoring for signs of infection and maintaining appropriate antibiotic treatment is crucial.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to the presence of a lung abscess. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Extubation may be considered once the patient's respiratory function improves.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be attributed to persistent infection and lung abscesses. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic stability is essential. Pressors may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). He presented with malaise, hyperkalemia, and back pain. He was initially diagnosed with sepsis and MSSA bacteremia and was started on antibiotics. The patient has respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He also has impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, pain control, renal failure, and seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia. Complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), worsening hypoxia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Sepsis/MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has sepsis caused by MSSA bacteremia. Complications may include septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
3. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is dependent on hemodialysis (HD). Complications may include hyperkalemia, fluid overload, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Ileus: The patient has an ileus, which may lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and infection.
5. Seizures: The patient has experienced seizures, which may recur and lead to complications such as status"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased since yesterday,
   no fevers in 72 hours.
   - On nafcillin (day 9) for MSSA
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough torequire
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless (though given the burden of abscesses in the
   lungs it would be interesting to get a look at tricuspid and pulmonic
   valves).
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable
   -greatly appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, cultures pending.  Results obviously limited given
   multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive blood cultures since [**8-25**].
   -sputum cx pos for MSSA from [**8-30**] and [**8-31**]
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -extubated
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now also low pressures [**1-25**] cvvh. Restarted pressors at 3am
   -will attempt to wean pressors prn
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, now on CVVH.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo and epo
   -renal following.
   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD; CVVH clotted off, will discuss with
   renal
   .
   #? Ileus: Pt had feculent material from NGT overnight. NGT placed on
   suction and has not had feculent material in past few hours. Surgery
   consulted and KUB and CT abd have initial reads which are reassuring s
   ileus or obstruction
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerating tube feeds
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40%). He presented with malaise, hypoglycemia, and back pain, and was found to have a pulmonary abscess, MSSA sepsis, and elevated white blood cell count. He has been intubated for airway protection and is currently on invasive ventilation. He has undergone several procedures and treatments, including dialysis, administration of antibiotics, and placement of a tunneled hemodialysis catheter. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, seizure disorder, pain control issues, and potential complications related to his ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current presentation suggests ongoing infection, evidenced by persistent blood cultures showing MSSA. There is a concern for the source of infection, which may be the tunneled catheter line. The patient is already on nafcillin and will be switched to cefazolin once on regular dialysis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to a seizure and has been experiencing copious purulent secretions. He is currently extubated but may require reintubation if his respiratory status deteriorates.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely secondary to"

 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased since yesterday,
   no fevers in 72 hours.
   - On nafcillin (day 9) for MSSA
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless (though given the burden of abscesses in the
   lungs it would be interesting to get a look at tricuspid and pulmonic
   valves).
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable
   -greatly appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, cultures pending.  Results obviously limited given
   multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive blood cultures since [**8-25**].
   -sputum cx pos for MSSA from [**8-30**] and [**8-31**]
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -extubated
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now also low pressures [**1-25**] cvvh. Restarted pressors at 3am
   -will attempt to wean pressors prn
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, now on CVVH.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo and epo
   -renal following.
   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD; CVVH clotted off, will discuss with
   renal
   .
   #? Ileus: Pt had feculent material from NGT overnight. NGT placed on
   suction and has not had feculent material in past few hours. Surgery
   consulted and KUB and CT abd have initial reads which are reassuring s
   ileus or obstruction
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerating tube feeds

   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased since yesterday,
   no fevers in 72 hours.
   - On nafcillin (day 9) for MSSA
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough torequire
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless (though given the burden of abscesses in the
   lungs it would be interesting to get a look at tricuspid and pulmonic
   valves).
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable
   -greatly appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, cultures pending.  Results obviously limited given
   multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive blood cultures since [**8-25**].
   -sputum cx pos for MSSA from [**8-30**] and [**8-31**]
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically

   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.

   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now also low pressures [**1-25**] cvvh. Restarted pressors at 3am
   -will attempt to wean pressors prn

   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, now on CVVH.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo and epo
   -renal following.
   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD

   #? Ileus: Pt had feculent material from NGT overnight. NGT placed on
   suction and has not had feculent material in past few hours. Surgery
   consulted and KUB and CT abd have initial reads which are reassuring s
   ileus or obstruction

   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.  Dosing
   adjusted now for CVVH.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who presented with malaise, back pain, and was found down. He was initially hyperkalemic and had elevated white blood cell count (WBC). Blood cultures showed MSSA. The patient was transferred from the floor for MSSA sepsis. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), seizure without status epilepticus, hypotension (not shock), pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), renal failure, end stage (ESRD), and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis, with suspected source being the tunnelled catheter line. Blood cultures are pending, but all negative for the past several days. The patient is on nafcillin for MSSA.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection after a seizure. He continues to have copious purulent secretions overnight. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to evaluate for vegetations.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to persistent infection and lung abscesses. Pressors were restarted at 3 am, and the patient will attempt to wean them as needed.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but all negative for past several days, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased since yesterday,
   no fevers in 72 hours.
   - On nafcillin (day 9) for MSSA
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless (though given the burden of abscesses in the
   lungs it would be interesting to get a look at tricuspid and pulmonic
   valves).
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable
   -greatly appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, cultures pending.  Results obviously limited given
   multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no positive blood cultures since [**8-25**].
   -sputum cx pos for MSSA from [**8-30**] and [**8-31**]
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -extubated
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now also low pressures [**1-25**] cvvh. Restarted pressors at 3am
   -will attempt to wean pressors prn
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, now on CVVH.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo and epo
   -renal following.
   -we will remember to change his keppra and allopurinol back to home
   doses once off CVVH and back on HD; CVVH clotted off, will discuss with
   renal
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hemodialysis dependent end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He presented with malaise, was found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for MSSA sepsis. In the ICU, he developed several medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and pain control issues. The patient underwent multiple interventions and tests, including dialysis, antibiotic therapy, imaging studies, and procedures to address the various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient was diagnosed with MSSA sepsis, which required prompt antibiotic treatment. There is suspicion that the tunneled catheter line might be the source of infection. Blood cultures showed MSSA, and the patient is currently on nafcillin.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection after experiencing a seizure. He continues to have copious purulent secretions and is awaiting further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent infection and lung abscesses likely contribute to his hypotension. Pressors were restarted at 3 AM, and"

 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but no recent positive cultures, earlier
   cultures grew MSSA.  Had been afebrile for past 2 days, but with low
   grade temps overnight.
   -WBC decreased past 2 days
 leukocytosis now resolved.
   - On nafcillin (day 10) for MSSA
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA.
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless (though given the burden of abscesses in the
   lungs it would be interesting to get a look at tricuspid and pulmonic
   valves).
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable.
   - appreciate ID recs
 will continue to follow.
   -LP performed, Gram stain negative, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   #Anemia
 HCT 21.8 today, down from 25.  No evidence of active bleed.
   -re-check hematocrit today, transfuse if necessary.
   -continue to follow.
   -active T & S
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -extubated
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now off pressors.
   -hypotensive episode overnight, responded to fluid bolus 250 cc.
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was on CVVH, now on HD
 2 liters
   negative yesterday.
   - continue phoslo and epo, sevalemer stopped yesterday as per renal
   recs.
   -renal following.
   -will check to make sure drug doses are appropriate now that on HD and
   not CVVH.
   .
   #? Ileus: Feculent material from NGT several days ago
 now resolved.
   Surgery saw and signed off, CT abd negative.
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerating tube feeds

   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue meds PO.

   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless (though given the burden of abscesses in the
   lungs it would be interesting to get a look at tricuspid and pulmonic
   valves). Will get repeat TTE tomorrow to evaluate for any developing
   valvular dis.
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He presented with malaise, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia. He was found down and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. The patient was transferred from the floor for MSSA sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis, suspected to be due to a tunneled catheter line infection. Blood cultures are pending.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection after a seizure and continues to have copious purulent secretions. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to evaluate for vegetations.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to persistent infection and lung abscesses. Pressors have been discontinued.
4. Back Pain: The patient has ongoing back pain, which may be related to the lung abscesses. A clear collar is in place due to altered mental status, and further evaluation of the spine is needed.
5. ESRD: The patient is currently hemodialysis (HD) dependent and was previously on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CV"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He presented with malaise, was found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis.
- The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute, due to a lung abscess. He is also experiencing hypotension, anemia, seizure, pain control, and ESRD.
- He has a history of multiple blood cultures positive for MSSA and a tunneled catheter line suspected as the source of infection. He underwent a C/T/L spine CT with contrast, which showed no gross abscess but did show lung abscesses.
- His renal function is being monitored closely, and he is currently on hemodialysis (HD) with a negative recent HD session.
- The patient's back pain has been documented, and he has been given fentanyl for pain control.
- He has had an episode of tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and received a bolus of fentanyl.
- The patient's seizure was attributed to HD and oxcarbazepine. He is currently on levet"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but no recent positive cultures, earlier
   cultures grew MSSA.  Had been afebrile for past 2 days, but with low
   grade temps overnight.
   -WBC decreased past 2 days
 leukocytosis now resolving
   - On nafcillin (day 10) for MSSA
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA.
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless (though given the burden of abscesses in the
   lungs it would be interesting to get a look at tricuspid and pulmonic
   valves). Will get repeat TTE tomorrow to evaluate for any developing
   valvular dis.
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable.
   - appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, Gram stain negative, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   #AMS: pt still altered/delerius 48hrs after extubation, worse since
   yesterday. Concerned for sepsis versus hypotension.
   #Anemia
 HCT 21.8 today, down from 25.  No evidence of active bleed.
   -re-check hematocrit today, transfuse if necessary.
   -continue to follow.
   -active T & S
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -extubated
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now off pressors.
   -hypotensive episode overnight, responded to fluid bolus 250
   cc.
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was on CVVH, now on HD
 2 liters
   negative yesterday.
   - continue phoslo and epo, sevalemer stopped yesterday as per renal
   recs.
   -renal following.
   -will check to make sure drug doses are appropriate now that on HD and
   not CVVH.
   .
   #? Ileus: Feculent material from NGT several days ago
 now resolved.
   Surgery saw and signed off, CT abd negative.
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerating tube feeds
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue meds PO.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.4- has been stable.
   -will trend
   .
   # ? renal mass: per CT read: 3. Right renal high denity region (2, 30)
   in a setting of end-stage renal disease, likely represents a hyperdense
   cyst, although underlying tumor cannot be ruled out. Close followup
   with ultrasound is recommended. Two left renal cysts as detailed above,
   (2, 29), (2, 21).
   -will need f/u as outpt
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds on. Needs S+S eval.  IVF boluses for hypotension.
   Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.  Renal
   also following with CVVH protocol- will have to be sure that he can
   still get it now that filter clotted off.

 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but no recent positive cultures, earlier
   cultures grew MSSA.  Had been afebrile for past 2 days, but with low
   grade temps overnight.
   -WBC decreased past 2 days
 leukocytosis now resolved.
   - On nafcillin (day 10) for MSSA
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA.
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless (though given the burden of abscesses in the
   lungs it would be interesting to get a look at tricuspid and pulmonic
   valves).
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable.
   - appreciate ID recs
 will continue to follow.
   -LP performed, Gram stain negative, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   #Anemia
 HCT 21.8 today, down from 25.  No evidence of active bleed.
   -re-check hematocrit today, transfuse if necessary.
   -continue to follow.
   -active T & S
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -extubated
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now off pressors.
   -hypotensive episode overnight, responded to fluid bolus 250 cc.
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was on CVVH, now on HD
 2 liters
   negative yesterday.
   - continue phoslo and epo, sevalemer stopped yesterday as per renal
   recs.
   -renal following.
   -will check to make sure drug doses are appropriate now that on HD and
   not CVVH.
   .
   #? Ileus: Feculent material from NGT several days ago
 now resolved.
   Surgery saw and signed off, CT abd negative.
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerating tube feeds
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue meds PO.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.4- has been stable.
   -will trend
   .
   # ? renal mass: per CT read: 3. Right renal high denity region (2, 30)
   in a setting of end-stage renal disease, likely represents a hyperdense
   cyst, although underlying tumor cannot be ruled out. Close followup
   with ultrasound is recommended. Two left renal cysts as detailed above,
   (2, 29), (2, 21).
   -will need f/u as outpt
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds on. Needs S+S eval.  IVF boluses for hypotension.
   Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.  Renal
   also following with CVVH protocol- will have to be sure that he can
   still get it now that filter clotted off.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. The patient presented with malaise, found down, and was initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for MSSA sepsis.

The patient has several medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, and pain control. He is currently on dialysis and has a tunneled catheter line, which may be a potential source of infection. The patient also has lung abscesses and a history of seizures. His renal function is impaired, and he has a history of ileus. He also has a non-ischemic CMY and requires monitoring for fluid status and medication adjustments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications due to ongoing infection and possible septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and antibiotic therapy is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation due to the presence of lung abscesses and ongoing respiratory secretions. Tracheostomy and airway protection may be considered.
3. Hypotension: Persistent hypotension may occur due to persistent infection"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). He presents with MSSA bacteremia and sepsis, for which he is being treated with nafcillin. The patient also has hypotension, which is being managed with fluid boluses and packed red blood cells (pRBCs) transfusion. He is experiencing delirium, respiratory failure, and pain control issues. Additionally, he has impaired skin integrity, renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's septic state, further deterioration in renal function, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and potential complications related to dialysis.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, and ensure adequate fluid resuscitation. Frequent assessment of renal function parameters, such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), should be performed to evaluate the progression of renal failure. Regular turning and assessment of the skin integrity are crucial to prevent pressure ulcers. Additionally, close monitoring of the patient's mental status is necessary to assess for any changes in delirium."

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with + bld
   cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect source
   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but no recent positive cultures, earlier
   cultures grew MSSA.  Had been afebrile for past 2 days, but with low
   grade temps overnight.
   -WBC decreased past 2 days
 leukocytosis now resolving
   - On nafcillin (day 10) for MSSA
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA.
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless (though given the burden of abscesses in the
   lungs it would be interesting to get a look at tricuspid and pulmonic
   valves). Will get repeat TTE tomorrow to evaluate for any developing
   valvular dis.
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable.
   - appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, Gram stain negative, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath on [**8-26**], tip grew MSSA.
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   #AMS: pt still altered/delerius 48hrs after extubation, worse since
   yesterday. Concerned for sepsis versus hypotension.
   #Anemia
 HCT 21.8 today, down from 25.  No evidence of active bleed.
   -re-check hematocrit today, transfuse if necessary.
   -continue to follow.
   -active T & S
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -extubated
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to persistent infection, lung abscesses.
   Now off pressors.
   -hypotensive episode overnight, responded to fluid bolus 250
   cc.
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was on CVVH, now on HD
 2 liters
   negative yesterday.
   - continue phoslo and epo, sevalemer stopped yesterday as per renal
   recs.
   -renal following.
   -will check to make sure drug doses are appropriate now that on HD and
   not CVVH.
   .
   #? Ileus: Feculent material from NGT several days ago
 now resolved.
   Surgery saw and signed off, CT abd negative.
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerating tube feeds
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue meds PO.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.4- has been stable.
   -will trend
   .
   # ? renal mass: per CT read: 3. Right renal high denity region (2, 30)
   in a setting of end-stage renal disease, likely represents a hyperdense
   cyst, although underlying tumor cannot be ruled out. Close followup
   with ultrasound is recommended. Two left renal cysts as detailed above,
   (2, 29), (2, 21).
   -will need f/u as outpt
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds on. Needs S+S eval.  IVF boluses for hypotension.
   Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.  Renal
   also following with CVVH protocol- will have to be sure that he can
   still get it now that filter clotted off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He presented with malaise, was found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for MSSA sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension (not shock), and pain control. He has undergone multiple interventions and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in sepsis, likely due to a tunnelled catheter line infection. Blood cultures are pending, but earlier cultures grew MSSA. The source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection after a seizure and continues to have copious purulent secretions. He has mild respiratory acidosis on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and was switched to assisted control (AC) overnight with slight improvement. Extubation may be considered if the patient's condition improves.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to persistent infection and lung abscesses. He is off pressors, but there was a hypotensive episode overnight that responded to a fluid bolus.

   reservations about placing tunneled line with recent fever (last
   night).
   -New plan is to keep fem line until tomorrow - will have HD tomorrow
   morning (called to confirm this with renal).  Then we will pull the fem
   line tomorrow after HD, give 2 day line holiday, and place tunneled
   cath on Wednesday.  Discussed with both IR and renal.
   -ID recs:  recommend removing HD catheter, recommend checking C. diff.
   Also consider imaging chest to evaluate abscesses.  Check sputum,
   culture if febrile.  Continue nafcillin.

   Imaging: The heart size is top normal, unchanged. There is gradual
   worsening of left
   retrocardiac opacity consistent with worsening of atelectasis. There is
   also
   in addition gradual increase in the left lower lung consolidation that
   might
   represent worsening infectious process as well as a combination of
   infection
   and pulmonary edema. It appears to be worse compared to [**2117-9-3**].
   The right basal opacity is unchanged. There is no significant interval
   increase in pleural effusions which are present and bilateral. Overall
   gradual worsening of the parenchymal involvement is noted. The known
   pulmonary nodules are difficult to see now obscured by multiple
   overlying
   abnormalities but can be still seen in the left upper lung. The left
   subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The NG tube tip is in
   the
   stomach.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis/Hypotension: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia,
   leukocytosis with + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in
   sepsis. Suspect source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has
   several blood cultures and line culture pending, but no recent positive
   cultures, earlier cultures grew MSSA.  Still hypotensive with fevers.
    -will need to determine if BP is accurate reflection and will possibly
   place A line; still on levophed and avoiding IVF. Will wean levophed as
   tolerated
   -Leukocytosis variably decreasing, slightly up today
   - On nafcillin (day 11) for MSSA
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA. Also with pseudomonas in wound culture
   from [**8-31**]. Pulling line today and will expect hypotension to improve and
   fevers to improve. ?if need to add pseudomonas coverage after that, or
   image for possible empyema. As per CXR, doesn
t appear to be any large
   loculated effusions to tap right now.
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless. Will f/u repeat TTE today
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable.
   -will repeat chest imaging to evaluate for any improvement in pulmonary
   abscesses
   - appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, Gram stain negative, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   #AMS: pt still altered/delerius 48hrs after extubation, now improving.
   Will continue to trend in light of sepsis/hypotension.
   #Anemia
 s/p 1 unit PRBC.  HCT 22.5 today. No evidence of active
   bleed.
   -re-check hematocrit today, transfuse if necessary.
   -continue to follow.
   -active T & S
   -epogen

   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. Had episode of
   tachypnea/presumed pain yesterday and gave bolus of fentanyl.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was on CVVH, now on HD; last HD on
   [**9-4**]
   - continue phoslo and epo, sevalemer stopped yesterday as per renal
   recs.
   -renal following.
   -IR reluctant to place tunneled line in light of fevers; will pull
   temporary dialysis line today and plan for HD in two days. If needs HD
   before two days, renal will place another temporary line; will send
   catheter tip for culture
   .
   #? Ileus: Feculent material from NGT several days ago
 now resolved.
   Surgery saw and signed off, CT abd negative.
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerating tube feeds
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin, f/u levels from this AM
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue meds PO.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
    - has been stable.
   -will trend
   .
   # ? renal mass: per CT read: 3. Right renal high denity region (2, 30)
   in a setting of end-stage renal disease, likely represents a hyperdense
   cyst, although underlying tumor cannot be ruled out. Close followup
   with ultrasound is recommended. Two left renal cysts as detailed above,
   (2, 29), (2, 21).
   -will need f/u as outpt
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds on. Needs S+S eval.  IVF boluses for hypotension.
   Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.  Renal

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease, and a previous myocardial infarction. He presents with malaise, back pain, and was found down initially with hyperkalemia. The patient has been admitted multiple times with MSSA sepsis, pulmonary abscesses, and pseudomonas in a wound culture. He is currently hypotensive and febrile, suspected to be in sepsis. Blood cultures and line culture are pending, but earlier cultures grew MSSA. The patient is on nafcillin for MSSA and will have his temporary femoral dialysis catheter removed today, with plans for tunneled catheter placement tomorrow. He will undergo hemodialysis tomorrow morning. The patient also has anemia, respiratory failure, chronic pain, renal failure, altered mental status, and a renal mass. He is receiving various medications for pain control, infection, and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient is currently in sepsis, as indicated by hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures for MSSA. The source of infection is suspected to be the tunneled catheter line. It is important to monitor blood pressure, follow cultures, and consider adding pseudomonas coverage if necessary.
2. Pulmonary Abscesses: The patient has pulmonary abs"

   reservations about placing tunneled line with recent fever (last
   night).
   -New plan is to keep fem line until tomorrow - will have HD tomorrow
   morning (called to confirm this with renal).  Then we will pull the fem
   line tomorrow after HD, give 2 day line holiday, and place tunneled
   cath on Wednesday.  Discussed with both IR and renal.
   -ID recs:  recommend removing HD catheter, recommend checking C. diff.
   Also consider imaging chest to evaluate abscesses.  Check sputum,
   culture if febrile.  Continue nafcillin.

   Imaging: The heart size is top normal, unchanged. There is gradual
   worsening of left
   retrocardiac opacity consistent with worsening of atelectasis. There is
   also
   in addition gradual increase in the left lower lung consolidation that
   might
   represent worsening infectious process as well as a combination of
   infection
   and pulmonary edema. It appears to be worse compared to [**2117-9-3**].
   The right basal opacity is unchanged. There is no significant interval
   increase in pleural effusions which are present and bilateral. Overall
   gradual worsening of the parenchymal involvement is noted. The known
   pulmonary nodules are difficult to see now obscured by multiple
   overlying
   abnormalities but can be still seen in the left upper lung. The left
   subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The NG tube tip is in
   the
   stomach.

   to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood cultures
   and line culture pending, but no recent positive cultures, earlier
   cultures grew MSSA.  Still hypotensive with fevers.
   -Leukocytosis variably decreasing, slightly up today
   - On nafcillin (day 11) for MSSA
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last

","Summary:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). He presented with malaise, was found down, and had hyperkalemia. He was transferred from the floor due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis.
- The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been treated with nafcillin for MSSA. Despite this, he remains hypotensive and febrile. Blood cultures show MSSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the wound culture from 8/31.
- The patient has altered mental status and is delirious, which could be due to sepsis or hypotension.
- He has anemia and received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), with a hematocrit of 23.8% today. There is no evidence of active bleeding.
- The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to persistent infection and lung abscesses. He remains on levophed.
- The patient has back pain and underwent a C-spine CT with contrast, which showed no gross abscess but did show lung abscesses.
- The patient has ESRD and is currently on hemodialysis (HD) through a temporary line. He will receive HD today and then have the temporary line pulled."

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis/Hypotension: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia,
   leukocytosis with + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess, MSSA bacteremia pt
   is currently in sepsis. Suspect source to be tunnelled catheter line.
   Pt currently has several blood cultures and line culture pending, but
   no recent positive cultures, earlier cultures grew MSSA.  Still
   hypotensive with fevers.
    -will need to determine if BP is accurate reflection and will possibly
   place A line; still on levophed and avoiding IVF. Will wean levophed as
   tolerated
   - On nafcillin (day 12) for MSSA
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA. Also with pseudomonas in wound culture
   from [**8-31**]. Pulled line yesterday and will expect hypotension to improve
   and fevers to improve. ?if need to add pseudomonas coverage after that,
   or image for possible empyema. As per CXR, doesn
t appear to be any
   large loculated effusions to tap right now.
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless. Will f/u repeat TTE today
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable.
   -will consider repeat chest imaging to evaluate for any improvement in
   pulmonary abscesses
   - appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, Gram stain negative, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -pt found to have sacral pustules versus vesicles which were sent for
   HSV/VZV PCR. Will follow these, not treating empirically
   #AMS: pt still altered/delerius after extubation, now improving. Will
   continue to trend in light of sepsis/hypotension.
   -limit narcotics for pain, use neurontin p HD

   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   -gabapentin p HD per neuro recs

   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was on CVVH, now on HD; last HD on
   [**9-4**]
   - continue phoslo and epo, sevalemer stopped yesterday as per renal
   recs.
   -renal following.
   -IR reluctant to place tunneled line in light of fevers; will pull
   temporary dialysis line today and plan for HD in two days. If needs HD
   before two days, renal will place another temporary line; will send
   catheter tip for culture

   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin, f/u daily dig levels
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous myocardial infarction (MI). He presented with malaise, was found down, and had hyperkalemia. He was transferred from the floor for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis. The patient has been hypotensive with fevers, suggesting ongoing sepsis. Cultures are pending, but earlier cultures grew MSSA. There is suspicion that the tunnelled catheter line may be the source of infection. 

The patient's current conditions include anemia, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute pain, chronic pain, renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and back pain. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient is in sepsis with suspected source being the tunnelled catheter line. Blood cultures and line culture are pending. He is currently on nafcillin for MSSA and will continue to follow cultures. The hypotension is expected to improve after removing the line. 
2. Back Pain: The patient has full-body pain, specifically back pain. A C-spine was placed, and a CT scan with contrast showed no gross abscess but did show lung abscesses. 
3. ESRD: The patient is HD dependent"

   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis/Hypotension: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia,
   leukocytosis with + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess, MSSA bacteremia pt
   is currently in sepsis. Suspect source to be tunnelled catheter line.
   Pt currently has several blood cultures and line culture pending, but
   no recent positive cultures, earlier cultures grew MSSA.  Still
   hypotensive with fevers.
    -will need to determine if BP is accurate reflection and will possibly
   place A line; still on levophed and avoiding IVF. Will wean levophed as
   tolerated
   - On nafcillin (day 12) for MSSA
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA. Also with pseudomonas in wound culture
   from [**8-31**]. Pulled line yesterday and will expect hypotension to improve
   and fevers to improve. ?if need to add pseudomonas coverage after that,
   or image for possible empyema. As per CXR, doesn
t appear to be any
   large loculated effusions to tap right now.
   -initially was considering getting TEE when c spine cleared but now in
   the setting of pulm abscess (req a long course of abx) and TTE neg for
   vegetations (suggesting no vegetations large enough to require
   intervention) it is not clear that we will need a TEE as course of abx
   will be 6 weeks regardless. Will f/u repeat TTE today
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis, renal function
   more stable.
   -will consider repeat chest imaging to evaluate for any improvement in
   pulmonary abscesses
   - appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, Gram stain negative, cultures pending.  Results
   obviously limited given multiple days of abx treatment.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. The patient presented with malaise, was found down, and had hyperkalemia with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis.

The patient's current medical complications include sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), renal failure (ESRD), anemia, altered mental status (AMS), diffuse pain/weakness, ileus, non-ischemic CMY, and seizure disorder.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Imaging studies reveal lung abscesses, a sacral pustule, and a renal mass.

The patient's current treatment plan includes ongoing administration of antibiotics for MSSA sepsis, hemodialysis, pain management, seizure control, and management of anemia. The patient's blood cultures and line culture are pending, and there is a concern for possible empyema or pulmonary abscesses.

Overall, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications and ongoing management in the ICU."

- Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient is still hypotensive with fevers, likely due to MSSA bacteremia with pulmonary abscesses. There are pending blood cultures, and earlier cultures grew MSSA. The source of infection is suspected to be the tunneled catheter line.
- Anemia: The patient has a hematocrit (Hct) of 21.3%, indicating anemia. The cause of anemia could be chronic kidney disease or gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by a guaiac-positive stool of unknown etiology.
- Diffuse pain/weakness: The patient has diffuse pain and weakness, which is likely related to his underlying medical conditions.
- ESRD: The patient is dependent on hemodialysis (HD), having previously undergone continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). His last HD was on"

   noted in the upper SVC. The OG tube courses downward but appears to end
   before the level of the diaphragm. Would recommend advancing the tube
   and re-

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis/Hypotension: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia,
   leukocytosis with + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess, MSSA bacteremia pt
   is currently in sepsis. Suspect source to be tunnelled catheter line.
   Pt currently has several blood cultures and line culture pending, but
   no recent positive cultures, earlier cultures grew MSSA.  Still
   hypotensive with fevers.
    -off levophed; still with low BP's. Could consider A line as pressures
   so low and wonder if this is an accurate reflection. If so, could
   consider midodrine
   - On nafcillin (day 13/42) for MSSA bacteremia w/ pulm abscesses
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA. Also with pseudomonas in wound culture
   from [**8-31**]. Pulled line 2 days ago and would  expect hypotension to
   improve and fevers to improve. ?if need to add pseudomonas coverage
   after that, or image for possible empyema. As per CXR, doesn
t appear
   to be any large loculated effusions to tap right now. Reluctatnt to
   pursue CT chest right now since hypotensive and tenous respiratory
   status. also has PICC line in- may need to pull in order to have true
   ""line holiday""
   -Repeat TTE showed no change from previous TTE on admission and no
   evidence of vegetations
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis
   - appreciate ID recs
   -LP performed, Gram stain negative, bacterial cultures negative. Viral
   cultures preliminarily negative.
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT. Have not done
   MRI, (cannot do with contrast anyway) but mental status seems to be
   improving somewhat
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -surveillance cultures until afebrile
   #AMS: pt still altered/delerius after extubation, now improving. Will
   continue to trend in light of sepsis/hypotension.
   -limit narcotics for pain, use neurontin p HD
   -neuro recommends head CT- no emergent need currently
   #Anemia
 Hct 21.3 yesterday. Unable to get labs yesterday. Pt does
   have guaiac positive stool of unknown etiology, stress ulcer would be
   high on ddx.
   -will hold on transfusion given volume overloaded and no HD line
   currently. Should have temp line placed today and will give blood when
   can dialyze
   -continue to follow.
   -active T & S
   -epogen
   .
   ##. Diffuse pain/weakness:  In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given
   his pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no
   gross abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.  Pt still
   c/o diffuse pain and is very weak
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   -gabapentin p HD per neuro recs
   -neuro recommends EMG- will consider when respiratory status and
   hemodynamic status more stable
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was on CVVH, now on HD; last HD on
   [**9-4**]
   - continue phoslo and epo, sevalemer stopped yesterday as per renal
   recs.
   -renal following.
   -IR reluctant to place tunneled line in light of fevers; will pull
   temporary dialysis line today and plan for HD afterwards.
   .
   #? Ileus: Feculent material from NGT several days ago
 now resolved.
   Surgery saw and signed off, CT abd negative.
   -seems to have resolved
   -tolerating tube feeds- will resume when NGT placement can be
   reconfirmed
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin, f/u daily dig levels (no level today, pending
   line placement)
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue meds PO (oxcarbezepine TID + xtra dose p HD, keppra [**Hospital1 **] +xtra
   dose p HD)
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
    - has been stable.
   -will trend
   .
   # ? renal mass: per CT read: 3. Right renal high denity region (2, 30)
   in a setting of end-stage renal disease, likely represents a hyperdense
   cyst, although underlying tumor cannot be ruled out. Close followup
   with ultrasound is recommended. Two left renal cysts as detailed above,
   (2, 29), (2, 21).
   -will need f/u as outpt
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds on. Needs S+S eval.  IVF boluses limited given fluid
   overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. The patient presented with malaise, was found down, and initially had hyperkalemia with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis. 

The patient's current conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (acute), anemia (other), alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, seizure without status epilepticus, hypotension (not in shock), pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), renal failure (end-stage), and altered mental status.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient is currently in sepsis with hypotension and fevers. The suspected source of infection is the tunneled catheter line. Blood cultures and line culture are pending, but earlier cultures grew MSSA. The patient is already on nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia with pulmonary abscesses. Cultures will be continued to be followed.

2. Anemia: The patient has a Hct of 21.3% and a guaiac positive stool of unknown etiology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He presented to the hospital with malaise, was found down, and initially had hyperkalemia. He was transferred from the floor for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has several comorbidities including anemia, altered mental status, pain control, respiratory failure, seizure, hypotension, renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient is currently in sepsis, which is suspected to be related to the tunneled catheter line. Despite being on nafcillin, he remains hypotensive with fevers. Blood cultures are pending, but earlier cultures grew MSSA. The source of infection appears to be the tunnelled catheter line, and the patient's hypotension and fevers are expected to improve once the line is removed and replaced.

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 21.8% today, with a previous transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday. He has a guaiac positive stool of unknown"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) presenting with diffuse pain, weakness, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient has been admitted multiple times for MSSA sepsis, pulmonary abscesses, and other comorbidities. He is currently on dialysis and has been experiencing persistent diffuse pain and weakness. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to have fevers and an elevated white blood cell count. Imaging shows no evidence of acute hemorrhage or vascular territorial infarction in the brain, but there is an interval increase in the opacification of bilateral maxillary sinuses and frontal opacification, which could be related to the patient's intubated status. The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on antiepileptic medication. He also has anemia, renal failure, and a possible renal mass that needs to be followed up with ultrasound. The patient's pain and weakness remain uncontrolled despite medication adjustments. Fluid overload is present, and the patient is still hypotensive. 

Potential Medical Complications:

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis/Hypotension: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia,
   leukocytosis with + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess, MSSA bacteremia pt
   is currently in sepsis. Suspect source to have been tunnelled catheter
   line. Pt currently has several blood cultures and line culture pending,
   but no recent positive cultures, earlier cultures grew MSSA.  Still
   hypotensive, now afebrile x 24 hours.
   - attributing intermittent fevers to persistent pulmonary abscesses
   that have not yet sterilized. Has been afebrile x 24 hours. He will
   likely have low grade fevers until his infection has more completely
   resolved. CT chest shows decreasing in size of pulmonary abscesses,
   lower lungs obscured by pleural effusions.
    -no pressor requirement but still with low BP's. Likely his baseline
   (though variable) given his other comorbidities
   - On nafcillin (day 15/42) for MSSA bacteremia w/ pulm abscesses
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA. Also with pseudomonas in wound culture
   from [**8-31**]. ""
   -Repeat TTE showed no change from previous TTE on admission and no
   evidence of vegetations
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis- will speak with
   renal today
   - appreciate ID recs .
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on repeat head CT
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -surveillance cultures until afebrile-pan cultured again today
   #AMS: pt still altered/delerius after extubation, now improving. Will
   continue to trend in light of sepsis/hypotension.
   -limit narcotics for pain, use neurontin p HD
   -repeat head CT with nothing acute
   #Anemia
 Hct 22.3  today; s/p 1 unit PRBC 2 days ago with HD. (and no
   real change in Hct). Pt does have guaiac positive stool of unknown
   etiology, stress ulcer would be high on ddx.
   -in light of volume overload, could consider transfusing at HD today;
   hemodynamically stable and not symptomatic
   -continue to follow.
   -active T & S
   -epogen
   .
   ##. Diffuse pain/weakness:  In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given
   his pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no
   gross abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.  Pt still
   c/o diffuse pain and is very weak
   - Fentanyl patch and fentanyl boluses for pain control
   -gabapentin p HD per neuro recs
   -EMG inconclusive; still need NCS- can consider when edema has gone
   down somewhat
   -PT consult
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was on CVVH, now on HD
   - continue phoslo and epo
   -renal following.
   -new temporary line placed earlier this week; for HD today
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin, f/u daily dig levels; gave extra dose yesterday
   as dig level was 0.3
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue meds PO (oxcarbezepine TID + xtra dose p HD, keppra [**Hospital1 **] +xtra
   dose p HD)
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.

   # elevated INR:
    - has been stable.
   -will trend
   .
   # ? renal mass: per CT read: 3. Right renal high denity region (2, 30)
   in a setting of end-stage renal disease, likely represents a hyperdense
   cyst, although underlying tumor cannot be ruled out. Close followup
   with ultrasound is recommended. Two left renal cysts as detailed above,
   (2, 29), (2, 21).
   -will need f/u as outpt

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He was admitted to the floor for suspected MSSA sepsis but was later transferred to the ICU due to hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures for MSSA bacteremia with pulmonary abscesses. The source of infection is suspected to be a tunneled catheter line. He is currently on nafcillin and will be switched to cefazolin when on regular dialysis. 

The patient has several medical complications, including anemia, altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute pain, renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and a possible renal mass. His pain and weakness are attributed to a cervical spine condition, and he has a history of seizure disorder. 

His vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 92/42 mmHg to 117/66 mmHg, heart rate between 91-102 bpm, respiratory rate of 12-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and liver enzymes. Blood cultures are pending, and imaging studies reveal decreasing pulmonary abscesses and pleural effusions."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. The note mentions that the patient has new effusions and cavitary lesions on a non-contrast CT chest. The patient also has elevated amylase and lipase levels, which could indicate pancreatitis. Additionally, the patient's blood work shows anemia, altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, seizure, hypotension, pain control, renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9 C (100.3 F), a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/42 mmHg to 117/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on a nasal cannula for respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, diffuse weakness, and rhonchorous breath sounds. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include anesthesia, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, seizure, hypotension, pain control, renal failure, end-stage renal disease, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and other conditions.

In summary, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, and others. Further evaluation"

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis/Hypotension: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia,
   leukocytosis with + bld cultures, pulmonary abscess, MSSA bacteremia pt
   is currently in sepsis. Suspect source to have been tunnelled catheter
   line. Pt currently has several blood cultures and line culture pending,
   but no recent positive cultures, earlier cultures grew MSSA.  Still
   hypotensive, now afebrile x 24 hours.
   - attributing intermittent fevers to persistent pulmonary abscesses
   that have not yet sterilized. Has been afebrile x 24 hours. He will
   likely have low grade fevers until his infection has more completely
   resolved. CT chest shows decreasing in size of pulmonary abscesses,
   lower lungs obscured by pleural effusions.
    -no pressor requirement but still with low BP's. Likely his baseline
   (though variable) given his other comorbidities
   - On nafcillin (day 15/42) for MSSA bacteremia w/ pulm abscesses
   - continue to follow cultures
 last positive blood culture [**8-25**], last
   resp. culture [**8-31**]
 both MSSA.
   -Repeat TTE showed no change from previous TTE on admission and no
   evidence of vegetations
   -Plan to switch to cefazolin when on regular dialysis- will speak with
   renal today
   - appreciate ID recs .
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on repeat head CT
   -non-contrast MRI showed no evidence for epidural abscess.  Also
   recommend followup of enlarged thyroid
 will defer until more stable.
   -surveillance cultures until afebrile-pan cultured again today
   .
   ## Barriers to rehab:
   -Still with low grade fevers (likely due to persistent pulmonary
   abscesses); will trend for the day and expect to remain low grade;
   rehab will take him while febrile
   -persistent difficulties with NGT- will place dobhoff today
   -currently with temporary dialysis line.  No plans to place tunneled
   catheter since still febrile. Will likely go to rehab with temporary
   line and not get permanent line until after finishes course for MSSA
   #AMS: pt still altered/delerius after extubation, now improving. Will
   continue to trend in light of sepsis/hypotension.
   -limit narcotics for pain, use neurontin p HD
   -repeat head CT with nothing acute
   #Anemia
 Hct 22.3  today; s/p 1 unit PRBC 2 days ago with HD. (and no
   real change in Hct). Pt does have guaiac positive stool of unknown
   etiology, stress ulcer would be high on ddx.
   -in light of volume overload, will be transfusing at HD today;
   hemodynamically stable and not symptomatic
   -continue to follow.
   -active T & S
   -epogen
   .
   ##. Diffuse pain/weakness:  In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given
   his pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no
   gross abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.  Pt still
   c/o diffuse pain and is very weak
   - Fentanyl patch and morphine PRN for pain control
   -gabapentin p HD per neuro recs
   -EMG inconclusive; still need NCS- can consider when edema has gone
   down somewhat
   -PT consult
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was on CVVH, now on HD
   - continue phoslo and epo
   -renal following.
   -new temporary line placed earlier this week; for HD today
   .
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**2114**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin, f/u daily dig levels; gave extra dose yesterday
   as dig level was 0.3
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure several nights ago, in setting of HD
   and on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). Will continue on home
   regimen of Levetiracetam, Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -continue meds PO (oxcarbezepine TID + xtra dose p HD, keppra [**Hospital1 **] +xtra
   dose p HD)
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   .
   # ? renal mass: per CT read: 3. Right renal high denity region (2, 30)
   in a setting of end-stage renal disease, likely represents a hyperdense
   cyst, although underlying tumor cannot be ruled out. Close followup
   with ultrasound is recommended. Two left renal cysts as detailed above,
   (2, 29), (2, 21).
   -will need f/u as outpt
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds on. IVF boluses limited given fluid overload. Will
   continue to follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.  Renal also
   following with HD

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is  59 yom with HD dependent ESRD, CAD s/p
   MI, non-ischemic CMY EF 35-40% admitted w/ 3 day h/o. malaise, found
   down and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for MSSA sepsis.
   #. Sepsis/Hypotension: initial presentation of hypotension,
   hypoglycemia, leukocytosis, + blood Cx for MSSA, and pulmonary abscess
   on chest CT with suspected source as tunneled HD catheter line.
   Patient continues to remain normotensive, off pressors.  Fever spike
   yesterday afternoon to 101.1. with low grade temps all day.  No
   surveillance cultures sent.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. The patient was admitted with a 3-day history of malaise, found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis.

The patient's current condition includes intermittent fevers, persistent pulmonary abscesses, and a suspected source as a tunneled hemodialysis (HD) catheter line. He is off pressors and remains normotensive. The patient's blood cultures were positive for MSSA, and he has been on nafcillin for 16 days out of a total of 42 days. The chest CT from September 9th demonstrates mildly improving infection.

The patient's medical history also includes a myocardial infarction (MI) and severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to mid-septal, anterior, and inferior segments of the left ventricle. He has been prescribed medications such as digoxin, fentanyl patch, morphine, gabapentin, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine.

The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is currently on maintenance hemodialysis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). He was admitted with a three-day history of malaise, found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. The patient was transferred from the floor for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis. 

During his stay in the ICU, the patient's condition has been fluctuating. He presented with initial hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis, positive blood culture for MSSA, and a pulmonary abscess on chest CT, which is suspected to be the source as the tunneled hemodialysis (HD) catheter line. The patient remains normotensive, off pressors, with intermittent fevers, and his pulmonary infection appears to be mildly improving. 

The patient is currently on nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia with pulmonary abscesses and will transition to cefazolin for easier dosing at the rehabilitation facility per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendation. Surveillance cultures will continue until the patient becomes afebrile.

Other barriers to rehabilitation include persistent difficulties with nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding, including a recently placed Dobhoff tube, raising the question of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient will require a permanent tun"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMY) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He was admitted with a three-day history of malaise, found down, and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. He was transferred from the floor for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including sepsis/hypotension, pulmonary abscess, anemia, diffuse pain/weakness, ESRD, non-ischemic CMY, and seizure disorder. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation included hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis, positive blood culture for MSSA, and pulmonary abscess. Although he is currently normotensive and off pressors, there is a concern for intermittent fevers due to persistent pulmonary abscesses.
2. Pulmonary Abscess: The patient has shown mildly improving infection on chest CT scans. It is important to continue monitoring his symptoms and follow-up cultures to ensure resolution of the abscess.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is low at 21.3%, indicating anemia. He has already"
