   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, presenting with respiratory distress secondary to influenza and PCP pneumonia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible worsening of heart failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress secondary to influenza and PCP pneumonia may lead to further deterioration of respiratory function, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's anuria since midnight and rising creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. This could progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rapid atrial fibrillation (a-fib) can lead to hemodynamic instability, increased risk of thromboembolic events, and potential complications such as heart failure.
4. Possible worsening of heart failure: The patient's presentation suggests a possible exacerbation of underlying heart failure, which can lead to further cardiac dysfunction and complications.
5. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's unstable vital signs and positive DFA for PCP indicate a potential septic state, which can result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not treated promptly.
6. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure readings may indicate hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications.
7. Multiple myeloma progression: The patient's recently diagnosed progression of MGUS to my"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory failure secondary to influenza and PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia).
2. Acute renal failure, with anuria since midnight and unresponsiveness to fluid bolus.
3. Atrial fibrillation (A-fib), which has responded to beta-blocker therapy but not to fluid bolus. The patient has a history of A-fib during a previous admission.
4. Metabolic acidosis due to acute renal failure.
5. Hypertension, which has resolved.
6. Multiple myeloma (cancer), with recently diagnosed progression from MGUS (Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance) to myeloma.
7. Anemia, stable at baseline, related to MM (Multiple Myeloma).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of respiratory failure due to ongoing infection and possible pulmonary edema.
2. Progression of acute renal failure, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease or the need for dialysis.
3. Recurrence or development of new arrhythmias, such as ventricular arrhythmias.
4. Metabolic disturbances due to ongoing metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Further complications related to multiple myeloma, such as bone fractures or infections.
6. Potential infections due to immunosuppression from PCP infection and underlying MM.

   distress secondary to influenza, PCP pneumonia and possible worsening
   of heart failure.  Also with acute renal failure and A-fib.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Respiratory failure secondary to PCP and influenza.  CXR with patchy
   opacities c/w multilobar PNA, unclear if there is a pulmonary edema
   component as patient did not respond to lasix 40mg and has been anuric
   since midnight despite bolus
   -Sputum positive for PCP--[**Name10 (NameIs) **] bactrim and steriods
   -Tamiflu for influenza
   -on Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin for possible bacterial
   PNA; sputum with GPCs

   -O2 sats good, most recent ABG: 7.22/41/171
   -Albuterol/ipratropium nebs
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) on Chronic Renal
   Insufficiency
   CRI thought to be due to multiple myeloma with baseline of 3.5; acute
   renal failure in setting of infection.  Now anuric since midnight,
   unresponsive to fluid.  Received bactrim for PCP last night, though per
   renal, bactrim will not cause such an acute drop in UOP in spite of
   rising Cr.
   -will obtain urine lytes and urine sediment
   -renal u/s
   -appreciate renal recs
   -[**Hospital1 7**] lytes

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   EKG with rapid a-fib and RVR, no signs of ischemia.  Echo in [**2127**]
   showed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 111**] which could predispose patient to A-fib.  Responsive
   to beta blockers, unresponsive to fluid bolus. New a-fib during last
   admission that responded to beta blockade, patient was discharged on
   metoprolol 75mg TID without anticoagulation.
   -In NSR on metoprolol 50 tid; may give lower dose if blood pressures do
   not tolerate full dose
   -no need for anticoagulation at this time, to be addressed as
   outpatient
   -Echo for today
   -Cycle CE to rule out ischemic event resulting in arrythmia, CE on
   admission stable (trop--0.03, 0.04, 0.03)
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   Resolved, continue to monitor
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Patient with recently diagnosed progression of MGUS to myeloma.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure secondary to influenza and PCP pneumonia. The CXR shows patchy opacities consistent with multilobar PNA, which may indicate pulmonary edema.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic renal insufficiency due to multiple myeloma. They are anuric since midnight despite fluid bolus.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation, which is responsive to beta blockers. They were previously discharged on metoprolol but without anticoagulation.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis due to acute renal failure.

5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension has resolved.

6. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has recently diagnosed progression of MGUS to myeloma. They have low calcium, high uric acid, and elevated LDH levels.

7. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia from MM.

Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further decline in renal function, persistent or recurrent atrial fibrillation, and progression of multiple myeloma.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, heart rhythm, and manage the underlying causes of these conditions. Additionally, the progression of multiple myeloma should be closely monitored and managed"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   P/F decreasing, c/w acute lung injury. Continue current vent settings
   recheck ABG this AM.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Suspect pulmonary source, also consider GI source given abdominal
   distension (though abdomen soft, benign appearing today)
   BPs borderline only short-lived response to IVF boluses. Adding
   neosynephrine peripherally until central access in place.
   Given renal failure can
t follow urine output. Would place central line
   to follow CVP.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Continue ceftriaxone,azithromycin,vancomycin given GPCs on gram.
   Consider D/C azithromycin. Vanc trough elevated today
 recheck trough
   in AM. Follow up cultures, reculture if febrile.
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids. ID recs appreciated.
 Anemia
   Hct decreased today, suspect reflects IVF resuscitation. However will
   check hemolysis labs as well. Repeat PM Hct, guiac stools. Transfuse
   Hb>7.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, beta blocker held in setting of borderline BP.
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Onc recs appreciated. Consider IVIG.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Etiology uncertain. FeUrea 13% c/w pre-renal state. Rebolus and assess
   Cr, urine output response. No evidence of obstruction, negative urine
   eos make interstitial nephritis less likely.  No significant
   hypotensive episodes documented prior to yesterday making ATN less
   likely. Renal dose meds. Nephrology recs appreciated. Repeat PM lytes.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now ?tube feeds
   Glycemic Control:  Regular insulin sliding scale, follow sugars today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and influenza. He has been unresponsive and sedated since admission. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), anemia, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which may require ongoing respiratory support in the form of mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, possibly due to a pulmonary or gastrointestinal source. This condition requires prompt management with appropriate antibiotics and source control measures.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, requiring continuation of current antibiotic therapy and consideration of de-escalation strategies based on culture results.
4. Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP): The patient is being treated for PCP with bactrim and steroids. Close monitoring and follow-up cultures are necessary to assess treatment effectiveness.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased, indicating anemia. Further evaluation for hemolysis and consideration of blood transfusion may be required.
6. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, and the etiology is uncertain. Fluid"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a newly diagnosed case of myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He also has influenza. 

The patient attempted a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) but required to be put back on assisted control ventilation (AC) with increased sedation. The physician held Coumadin due to the patient's elevated INR and plans to start him on heparin once the INR is no longer supratherapeutic. The patient may need dialysis if he remains anuric.

The family was informed of the patient's poor prognosis but they are still adjusting to his rapid decompensation. The patient is full code. The physician deferred central venous line placement given that the patient is likely to receive a dialysis line tomorrow. A renal ultrasound was performed and came back unremarkable.

The patient's troponin level was elevated to 0.13 in the setting of increasing creatinine. An OG tube was placed to suction due to distention and concern for obstruction on KUB; a large amount of liquid brown-green output immediately resulted. An extra dose of vancomycin was given for a subtherapeutic trough level. The patient continued to be anuric with rising creatinine. Episodes of hypotension were responsive to IV fluids.

Free calcium levels were low, and the patient was repleted with calcium gluconate before learning from the pharmacy that calcium glu"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and influenza. He has been experiencing various medical complications, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), PCP infection, anemia, renal failure (acute), and an underlying malignancy (multiple myeloma).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The ABG results indicate acute lung injury, and there have been attempts to wean him off ventilator support. However, there is a concern for potential worsening of respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. He has received multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin, to treat the suspected bacterial infections. There is a risk of further deterioration if the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are ineffective.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has developed hospital-acquired pneumonia, which requires ongoing treatment with antibiotics. There is a possibility of worsening lung infection and respiratory distress.
4. PCP Infection: The patient tested positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and he is being treated with bactrim and steroids. If left untreated, PCP can lead to severe respiratory complications.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and the et"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma and influenza who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications that can arise due to his current condition and underlying conditions. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which indicates severe lung dysfunction. The ABG results show hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 223) and hypercapnia (TCO2 of 38 mmHg), suggesting inadequate gas exchange. Continued monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to optimize respiratory support.

2. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has signs of systemic infection with positive cultures for GPC and PCP. The combination of respiratory failure, positive blood cultures, and other symptoms suggests sepsis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further investigations may be needed to identify the source of infection.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated, and there is anuria (no urine output). This indicates renal dysfunction, which can progress to acute kidney injury. Fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of fluid balance are important in managing this condition. Consideration should also be given to dialysis if the patient remains anuric.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, as indicated by the positive s"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   P/F decreasing, c/w acute lung injury. Continue current vent settings
   recheck ABG this AM.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Suspect pulmonary source, also consider GI source given abdominal
   distension (though abdomen soft, benign appearing today)
   BPs borderline only short-lived response to IVF boluses. Adding
   neosynephrine peripherally until central access in place.
   Given renal failure can
t follow urine output. Would place central line
   to follow CVP.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Continue ceftriaxone,azithromycin,vancomycin given GPCs on gram.
   Consider D/C azithromycin. Vanc trough elevated today
   Follow up culture, reculture if febrile.
 PCP
   Continue bactrim, steroids. ID recs appreciated.
 Anemia
   Hct decreased today, suspect reflects IVF resuscitation. However will
   check hemolysis labs as well. Repeat PM Hct, guiac stools. Transfuse
   Hb>7.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, beta blocker held in setting of borderline BP.
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Onc recs appreciated. Consider IVIG.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Etiology uncertain. FeUrea 13% c/w pre-renal state. Rebolus and assess
   Cr, urine output response. No evidence of obstruction, negative urine
   eos make interstitial nephritis less likely.  Renal dose meds.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient also has influenza.

The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple interventions. He was initially placed on mechanical ventilation but needed to be put back on assisted control mode due to fighting the ventilator. His INR is supratherapeutic, so heparin therapy will be initiated instead of coumadin. The patient's renal function is compromised, and if he remains anuric, he may require dialysis within the next 3-6 days.

The patient's family was informed of the poor prognosis but is still adjusting to the rapid decompensation. The patient is FULL CODE. A central venous line has been deferred because the patient is likely to get a dialysis line tomorrow. A renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.

The patient's troponin level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac involvement. An OG tube was placed to suction due to distention and concern for obstruction on the KUB, resulting in a large amount of liquid brown-green output. An extra dose of vancomycin was given for a subtherapeutic trough level.

The patient continues to be anuric with rising creatinine levels. He experiences episodes of hypotension, which respond to IV fluids. The patient's calcium level is low and was repleted with calcium gluconate before it was discovered that calcium glu"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): continue mechanical
   ventilation, increase PEEP if oxygenation worsen; dialysis and pressors
   to get some fluid off; consider ARDS-net ventilation if he worsens from
   oxygenation
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION: CVC placement, follow CVP and MAP,
   ScvO2, cont abx but would change CTX to anti-pseudomonal penicillin and
   add antifungal, adjust abx for CVVH
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP): abx as per ID
   includes influenza, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] possible bacterial sources
 ANEMIA: likely fluid-related, follow PM hct and hemolysis labs today
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM): no interventions at
   this time
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): CVVH to start today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is being mechanically ventilated. They have worsening hemodynamics and oxygenation, indicating possible septic shock. The patient is unable to provide their medical history due to sedation.

The patient has been receiving various antibiotics since admission, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and Bactrim. They are also receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/39 to 118/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Their weight is 91.7 kg, and they have received a total of 5,114 mL of fluids since 12 AM.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and elevated troponin T level. Other lab values such as potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and blood glucose are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of respiratory distress, with bronchial breath sounds and rhonchi present. They also have distended and hypoactive bowel sounds, as well as edema in both lower extremities."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   P/F improved from yesterday AM, still in acute lung injury range.  pH
   improved likely [**2-26**] CVVH.
   Taking intermittent large tidal volumes, at risk for ptx given PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 133**] increase sedation as BP tolerates, hold off on paralytics at this
   time. Goal TV 6ml/kg. Continue current vent settings recheck ABG in
   afternoon.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Hemodyanamically more stable today off of pressors, no significant
   fevers.
   Suspect pulmonary source, also consider GI source given abdominal
   distension. On broad antibiotic coverage currently.
   Continues to make essentially no urine so can
t follow urine output as
   marker of end organ perfusion.
   Target MAP>65. SvO2 ok at 87% yesterday.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Patient with few strep pneumoniae on sputum gram stain. Unclear if
   pathogenic, but will treat. Call lab to check sensitivities. Continue
   current regimen vancomycin, zosyn, azithromycin per ID. IVIG given
   yesterday. Started ambisome yesterday empirically continue for now
   while tenuous. Redose vancomycin today for trough ~15 (target 15-20)
   and recheck level in AM.
 Influenza
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids.
 Anemia
   Poor response to transfusion yesterday. No evidence of hemolysis and no
   heme+ stools [**Name8 (MD) **] RN report. Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 7**], continue PPI. Transfuse
   1unit PRBC target Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   Cytoxan last received on [**2-26**], this is near expected period for WBC
   nadir.  Multiple other reasons for cytopenia including influenza
   infection or other medications such as bactrim. Follow, check
   differential and ANC. D/w oncology regarding neupogen plans.
 Abdominal distension
   Concern for SBO, may be [**2-26**] fentanyl. Trial of PO narcan today. Follow
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] replete K >4, Magnesium>2
 Coagulopathy
   No evidence for DIC at this time. Will decrease SQ heparin to [**Hospital1 7**]
   dosing in light of PTT elevation.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, restart low dose beta blocker as BP tolerates.
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Onc recs appreciated.  s/p IVIG
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Still essentially anuric, see [**3-6**] for differential dx discussion. On
   CVVH. Renal recommendations appreciated. Renal dose meds.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: start tube feeds at low dose as tolerated, if unable to
   tolerate then consider TPN tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of myeloma admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with influenza and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient has undergone several interventions including placement of a femoral dialysis line, subclavian central line, and CVVH. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, including cefepime and ambisome. The patient's blood pressure has required support with levophed briefly, and he has received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The patient has multiple allergies, including Flomax.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. His PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 258, indicating significant hypoxemia.
2. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient is suspected to have sepsis with a potential pulmonary or gastrointestinal source. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, but his urine output is essentially nil, making it difficult to assess organ perfusion.
3. Hospital-acquired Pneumonia: The patient has Streptococcus pneumoniae present in his sputum gram stain, and he is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
4. Influenza: The patient is being treated for influenza with oseltamivir.
5. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): The patient is being treated with b"

 Anemia
   Poor response to transfusion yesterday. No evidence of hemolysis and no
   heme+ stools [**Name8 (MD) **] RN report. Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 7**], continue PPI. Transfuse
   1unit PRBC target Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   Cytoxan last received on [**2-26**], this is expected period for nadir.
   Multiple other reasons for cytopenia including influenza infection or
   other medications such as bactrim. Follow, check differential and ANC.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of myeloma admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza and PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 6.0 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, and renal failure with a creatinine level of 6.8 mg/dL. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, PJP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), anemia, leukopenia, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis to septic shock, development of resistant bacterial infection due to broad-spectrum antibiotic use, worsening of renal function, and further complications related to multiple myeloma.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with myeloma who was admitted due to respiratory distress.
- He has been diagnosed with influenza and PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia).
- Various interventions have been performed, including femoral dialysis line placement, subclavian central line placement, transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs, and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient's allergies include Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl) and orthostasis.
- The last doses of antibiotics were given at different times.
- The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management.
- Other medications include heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and flow sheet data.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36 C, HR: 64 bpm, BP: 119/47 mmHg, RR: 25 inspiratory/min, SpO2: 97%, and CVP: 16 mmHg.
- The patient's weight has increased from 87.6 kg to 97.6 kg.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 5,319 mL and total output of 1,833 mL.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 550 mL, RR set at 24, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and ABG results indicating a pH of 7.31.
- Physical examination reveals endotracheal tube placement, OG tube draining dark liquid, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and absent peripheral pulses.
- Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities.
- The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, PJP, anemia, leukopenia, multiple myeloma, acute renal failure, and various other conditions.
- Assessment and plan include continuing current vent settings, treating suspected pulmonary source, monitoring urine output, administering broad-spectrum antibiotics, and considering tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can worsen if the underlying cause (in this case, pneumonia) is not effectively treated or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction. If not promptly treated, it can progress to septic shock, leading to organ dysfunction and potential failure.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. If the antibiotics used are ineffective or if the organism becomes resistant, the infection may not be adequately controlled, leading to worsening pneumonia.

4. PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia): The patient is being treated for PJP with bactrim and steroids"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   P/F improved from yesterday AM, still in acute lung injury range. pH
   improved likely [**2-26**] CVVH. Continue current vent settings recheck ABG
   this AM.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Hemodyanamically more stable today off of pressors, no significant
   fevers.
   Suspect pulmonary source, also consider GI source given abdominal
   distension. On broad antibiotic coverage currently.
   Continues to make essentially no urine so can
t follow urine output as
   marker of end organ perfusion.
   Target MAP>65. SvO2 fine at 87%.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Patient with few strep pneumoniae on sputum gram stain. Unclear if
   pathogenic, but will treat. Continue current regimen vancomycin, zosyn,
   azithromycin per ID. IVIG given yesterday. Started ambisome yesterday
   empirically, could consider d/c.
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids.
 Anemia
   Poor response to transfusion yesterday. No evidence of hemolysis and no
   heme+ stools [**Name8 (MD) **] RN report. Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 7**], continue PPI. Transfuse
   1unit PRBC target Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   Cytoxan last received on [**2-26**], this is expected period for nadir.
   Multiple other reasons for cytopenia including influenza infection or
   other medications such as bactrim. Follow, check differential and ANC.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, beta blocker held in setting of borderline BP.
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Onc recs appreciated.  s/p IVIG
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Still essentially anuric, see [**3-6**] for differential dx discussion. On
   CVVH. Renal recommendations appreciated. Renal dose meds.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old man with respiratory failure secondary to multiple pulmonary infections, including influenza, PCP, and Pneumococcus. He is moderately dyssynchronous and not yet ready to come off the ventilator. The plan is to increase sedation and target 6cc/kg/breath tidal volumes. A repeat CXR will be done today.

The patient also has pneumonia caused by PCP and Pneumococcus, which will be treated with Bactrim. He is already on steroids, and Tamiflu will be continued for viral influenza pneumonia.

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with acute on chronic renal failure, now on CVVHD. The line will be changed to IJ today. He received IVIG yesterday for severe sepsis and multiple myeloma (cancer, malignant neoplasm). He recently underwent chemotherapy.

The patient is also experiencing ileus and will begin oral narcan. Gentle beta blockade will be initiated due to new onset atrial fibrillation. Coagulopathy is likely related to heparin, and DIC labs will be checked.

ICU care includes trying TF today for nutrition. If progress is not made, TPN may be needed. The patient's glycemic control is well-controlled with regular insulin sliding scale. He has multiple lines, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen line.

Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention with boots and SQ UF H"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with respiratory failure secondary to multiple pulmonary infections, including influenza, PCP, and Pneumococcus. He has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently on CVVHD. He also has severe sepsis, multiple myeloma, ileus, atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, and obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to multiple pulmonary infections. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function if the infections are not effectively treated.
2. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's chronic renal failure has worsened, necessitating CVVHD. There is a risk of fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and further deterioration in renal function.
3. Severe Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt and aggressive treatment. Delayed or inadequate treatment may lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's recent chemotherapy treatment for multiple myeloma increases his risk of infections and complications related to immunosuppression.
5. Ileus: The patient's ileus can lead to abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. If not treated appropriately, it may progress to bowel perforation or ischemia.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Last ABG shows acceptable oxygenation.
   TVs improved since methadone started but would increase sedation
   further to achieve TV of 6cc/kg (~540 based on 88kg admit weight).
   Monitor QTc while on methadone last 419ms on [**3-4**].
   Continue current vent settings recheck ABG in afternoon.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Hypotensive off of CVVH this AM during rounds
 CVP 15 arguing against
   significant volume depletion. Back on levophed.
   Continues to make essentially no urine so can
t follow urine output as
   marker of end organ perfusion.
   Target MAP>65. Recheck Svo2.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Patient with few strep pneumoniae on sputum gram stain, awaiting
   sensitivities. Continue current regimen vancomycin, zosyn, azithromycin
   per ID. s/p IVIG. Continue ambisome empirically for now while tenuous.
   Hold vancomycin today as trough 21.3 (goal trough 15-20), repeat trough
   in AM. Checking CMV viral load, glucan, galactomannan per ID
   recommendations. Note that patient has been on Zosyn this admission so
   may have false + fungal antigen.
 [**Hospital **]
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids. PO steroids okay.
 Anemia
   Poor response to transfusion [**3-6**]. No evidence of hemolysis. Trace
   heme+ stools today [**Name8 (MD) **] RN. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to obstruction now resolving.
   Labs without evidence of DIC.
   Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 7**], continue PPI. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   Cytoxan last received on [**2-26**], this is near expected period for WBC
   nadir.  Multiple other reasons for cytopenia including [**Month/Day (2) 134**]
   infection or other medications such as bactrim. D/w oncology regarding
   neupogen plans.
 Abdominal distension
   Improved today, passing stool and tolerating tube feeds.  Replete lytes
   prn.
 Coagulopathy
   PTT decreased today following decreased dose of SQ heparin. Follow
   coags daily.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, continue low dose beta blocker as BP tolerates.
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Onc recs appreciated.  s/p IVIG
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Still essentially anuric, see [**3-6**] for differential dx discussion. On
   CVVH. Renal recommendations appreciated. Renal dose meds. No HD today,
   await dialysis catheter placement.
 Hyponatremia
   Check with renal re CVVH bath

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with myeloma admitted for respiratory failure. He has positive PCP and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in his sputum. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including methadone, antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime/azithromycin, Bactrim), antifungals (Ambisome), and antivirals (oseltamivir). He is also receiving IVIG, heparin, and renal dose medications. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm. He has multiple comorbidities including anemia, leukopenia, hyponatremia, and renal failure. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill with ongoing respiratory, infectious, and renal issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adherence to VAP prevention protocols are essential.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection and is already diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. Continued monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy is necessary to manage sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Hemodyanamically stable off of pressors, no significant fevers.
   Suspect pulmonary source, also consider GI source given abdominal
   distension. On broad antibiotic coverage currently.

   Target MAP>65. Recheck Svo2.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Patient with few strep pneumoniae on sputum gram stain. Unclear if
   pathogenic, but will treat. Awaiting sensitivities. Continue current

   ambisome empirically for now while tenuous. Hold vancomycin today as
   trough 21.3 (goal trough 15-20), repeat trough in AM. Checking CMV
   viral load, glucan, galactomannan per ID recommendations. Note that
   patient has been on Zosyn this admission so may have false + fungal
   antigen.
 [**Hospital **]
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids.
 Anemia
   Poor response to transfusion [**3-6**]. No evidence of hemolysis. Trace
   heme+ stools today, will check DIC labs.
   Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 7**], continue PPI. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   Cytoxan last received on [**2-26**], this is near expected period for WBC
   nadir.  Multiple other reasons for cytopenia including [**Month/Day (2) 134**]
   infection or other medications such as bactrim. D/w oncology regarding
   neupogen plans.
 Abdominal distension
   Improved today s/p PO narcan.
   Concern for SBO, may be [**2-26**] fentanyl. Replete lyes.
 Coagulopathy
   Checking DIC labs as above, consider DC SQ heparin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been found to have PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 137**] in his sputum. He was drawing large tidal volumes despite increasing sedation, so IV methadone was started, which improved his sync with the ventilator. Tube feeds were initiated, and the patient is tolerating them. The patient has trace heme+ stools. The patient is unable to provide a history as he is sedated. Allergies include Flomax (Oral) (Tamsulosin Hcl) and orthostasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other lung infections.
2. Sepsis with or without organ dysfunction, potentially from a pulmonary or gastrointestinal source.
3. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) infection.
4. Hospital-acquired pneumonia.
5. Clostridium difficile infection, indicated by trace heme+ stools.
6. Acute kidney injury or renal failure.
7. Multiple myeloma-related complications.
8. Thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
9. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
11. Potential adverse effects of medications, including methadone and vancomycin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has tested positive for PCP and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 119/48 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ceftazidime, azithromycin, and amphotericin B. He is also receiving treatment for PJP with bactrim and steroids. The patient's urine output is essentially zero, and he is dependent on dialysis due to acute renal failure. His blood counts show leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, but is currently in sinus rhythm. He has a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and multiple myeloma. The patient's family has been informed of his condition,"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Last ABG shows acceptable oxygenation.
   TVs improved since methadone started but would increase sedation
   further to achieve TV of 6cc/kg (~540 based on 88kg admit weight).
   Monitor QTc while on methadone last 419ms on [**3-4**].
   Continue current vent settings recheck ABG in afternoon.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Hypotensive off of CVVH this AM during rounds
 CVP 15 arguing against
   significant volume depletion. Back on levophed.
   Continues to make essentially no urine so can
t follow urine output as
   marker of end organ perfusion.
   Target MAP>65. Recheck Svo2.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Patient with few strep pneumoniae on sputum gram stain, awaiting
   sensitivities. Continue current regimen vancomycin, zosyn, azithromycin
   per ID. s/p IVIG. Continue ambisome empirically for now while tenuous.
   Hold vancomycin today as trough 21.3 (goal trough 15-20), repeat trough
   in AM. Checking CMV viral load, glucan, galactomannan per ID
   recommendations. Note that patient has been on Zosyn this admission so
   may have false + fungal antigen.
 Influenza
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids. PO steroids okay.
 Anemia
   Poor response to transfusion [**3-6**]. No evidence of hemolysis. Trace
   heme+ stools today [**Name8 (MD) **] RN. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to obstruction now resolving.
   Labs without evidence of DIC.
   Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 7**], continue PPI. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   Cytoxan last received on [**2-26**], this is near expected period for WBC
   nadir.  Multiple other reasons for cytopenia including influenza
   infection or other medications such as bactrim. D/w oncology regarding
   neupogen plans.
 Abdominal distension
   Improved today, passing stool and tolerating tube feeds.  Replete lytes
   prn.
 Coagulopathy
   PTT decreased today following decreased dose of SQ heparin. Follow
   coags daily.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, continue low dose beta blocker as BP tolerates.
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Onc recs appreciated.  s/p IVIG
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Still essentially anuric, see [**3-6**] for differential dx discussion. On
   CVVH. Renal recommendations appreciated. Renal dose meds. No HD today,
   await dialysis catheter placement.
 Hyponatremia
   Check with renal re CVVH bath

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myeloma admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with influenza and PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), as well as pneumococcal and yeast infections in his sputum. 

The patient experienced hypotension after CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and required the use of levophed, a medication used to support blood pressure. CVVH was also held due to hypotension, and a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) was administered. The tidal volume was decreased to 470 mL with close monitoring of arterial blood gas (ABG) levels.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), multiple myeloma, renal failure (acute), and hyponatremia. 

In terms of treatment, the patient is receiving various antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and bactrim, for different infections. Ambisome, a medication used to treat fungal infections, is being administered empirically. The patient is also on oseltamivir for influenza, bactrim for PJP, steroids for PJP and myeloma, and other medications for anemia, leukopenia"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   TV were decreased yesterday, overbreathing vent still but TV
   essentially at goal 6cc/kg (~540 based on 88kg admit weight)
   Last ABG shows acceptable oxygenation.  P/F ~stable. Monitor QTc while
   on methadone last 419ms on [**3-4**].
   Continue current vent settings recheck ABG in afternoon.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   BP stable now off of pressors. Had been getting aggressive fluid
   removal via CVVH likely accounted for hypotension yesterday
   Continues to make essentially no urine so can
t follow urine output as
   marker of end organ perfusion.
   Target MAP>65.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Patient with few strep pneumoniae on sputum gram stain, awaiting
   sensitivities.
   Continue current regimen vancomycin, zosyn, azithromycin per ID. Dose
   vancomycin with HD per renal.
   Checking CMV viral load, glucan, galactomannan per ID recommendations.
   Note that patient has been on Zosyn this admission so may have false +
   fungal antigen.
 Influenza
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids.
 Anemia

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myeloma admitted for respiratory distress.
- The patient has been diagnosed with influenza, PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), pneumococcus, and yeast in his sputum.
- The patient experienced hypotension after CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and required the use of levophed (a vasopressor).
- CVVH was held due to hypotension, and a tunneled catheter was not placed.
- The patient received additional sedation with haldol (haloperidol).
- The patient received a blood transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
- The tidal volume was decreased to 470 mL, and close monitoring of ABG (arterial blood gas) values is ongoing.
- The patient is unable to provide history as he is sedated.
- The patient has allergies to Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl) and orthostasis.
- The last doses of antibiotics were given at different times, including Ambisome, vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime, and Bactrim.
- The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation, respectively.
- Other medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis and unspecified ICU medications.

   essentially at goal 6cc/kg (~540 based on 88kg admit weight)
   Last ABG shows acceptable oxygenation.  P/F ~stable. Monitor QTc while
   on methadone last 419ms on [**3-4**].
   Decrease PEEP to 8 and repeat ABG this afternoon.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   BP stable now off of pressors. Had been getting aggressive fluid
   removal via CVVH likely accounted for hypotension yesterday
   Continues to make essentially no urine so can
t follow urine output as
   marker of end organ perfusion.
   Target MAP>65.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Patient with few strep pneumoniae on sputum gram stain, awaiting
   sensitivities.
   Continue current regimen vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin per ID.
   Dose vancomycin with HD per renal.
   Checking CMV viral load, glucan, galactomannan per ID recommendations.
   Note that patient has been on Zosyn this admission so may have false +
   fungal antigen.
 Influenza
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids.
 Anemia
   Poor response to transfusion [**3-6**]. No evidence of hemolysis on recent
   labs. Had trace heme+ stools yesterday [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, recheck today. Repeat
   DIC labs. Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 7**], continue PPI. Transfuse Hb>7.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myeloma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with influenza, PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), pneumococcus, and yeast infections. The patient has experienced hypotension after CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and required the use of levophed. His condition has led to several complications including respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, anemia, leukopenia, abdominal distension, renal failure, and hyponatremia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, bactrim, oseltamivir, and steroids. He is also receiving CVVH and has a plan for dialysis catheter placement today. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.6°C, heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 107/44 mmHg, respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. The patient's overall condition remains unstable, and he is closely monitored in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and continued support with mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with respiratory failure due to multiple pulmonary infections including influenza, PCP, and Pneumococcus.
- He experienced shock which resolved overnight with transfusion.
- The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), multiple myeloma (cancer), and anemia.
- He is currently on hemodialysis and receiving treatment for various infections, including PCP pneumonia, viral influenza, and hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Pneumococcus.
- The patient's respiratory failure is not associated with ARDS.
- The plan is to decrement PEEP today, decrease sedation, and consider pressure support in the next day or two.
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and other medications specific to each infection.
- He also has a history of allergies to Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl) and orthostasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ongoing pulmonary infections.
2. Shock, which can recur if the patient becomes hypovolemic again.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring ongoing hemodialysis.
4. Multiple myeloma (cancer) with potential complications related to bone marrow suppression and increased risk of infections.
5. Anemia due to chronic disease or underlying conditions.
6. Potential complications from the various medications and treatments the patient is receiving.
7. Risk of developing ventil"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   P/F decreased today. Did not tolerated decrease in PEEP yesterday, may
   be [**2-26**] pulmonary edema (vs pna).  Also consider whether cardiac
   ischemic could be contributory to difficulty with weaning vent.
   --Reattempt decrease PEEP today with repeat ABG.
   --Check EKG now, and repeat when PEEP has been decreased to assess for
   ST/T changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
   --Would attempt to remove additional fluid at HD today if
   hemodynamically tolerated, will d/w renal.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   BP stable, off pressors. Continues to make essentially no urine so
   can
t follow urine output as marker of end organ perfusion.
   Target MAP>65.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Given increased R sided opacity and failure to improve oxygenation
   significantly will continue current abx. Pneumococus in sputum will be
   covered on current regimen.
   Continue vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin. Dose vancomycin with HD
   per renal. If clinically improved tomorrow, would consider
   discontinuing vancomycin or azithromycin.
   Galactomannan detectable but <0.5; Note that patient has been on Zosyn
   this admission so may have false + fungal antigen.
 [**Hospital **]
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids.
 Anemia
   Hct stable, will hold off on transfusion at this time. No evidence of
   active bleeding (did have heme+ stool earlier in the week) follow Hct,
   continue PPI. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   Cytoxan last received on [**2-26**], this is near expected period for WBC
   nadir.  Check ANC. Multiple other reasons for cytopenia including
   [**Month/Day (2) 134**] infection or other medications such as bactrim. D/w oncology
   regarding neupogen plans.
 Abdominal distension
   Improved, passing stool and tolerating tube feeds.  Replete lytes prn.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, continue low dose beta blocker as BP tolerates.
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myeloma, pneumonia, and PJP. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), anemia, leukopenia, abdominal distension, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, renal failure, hyponatremia, and acute kidney injury. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. He is on multiple medications including vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, bactrim, steroids, oseltamivir, and PPI. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 111/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on 10 cmH2O of PEEP, temperature of 36.8°C, and a CVP of 11 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygenation worsened when PEEP was decreased, indicating potential pulmonary edema or cardiac ischemia contributing to difficulty with weaning from the ventilator. Repeat ABG and EKG should be done to further assess the situation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is still essentially anuric and off pressors, making it difficult to monitor end organ perfusion. Target MAP >65 should be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with myeloma and influenza, also showing growth of PJP and pneumococcus in the sputum. He underwent dialysis line placement and hemodialysis without complications. The patient's PEEP was decreased to 8 then 5 due to worsening oxygenation, but it was increased back to 10. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/44 mmHg to 141/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals disconjugate pupils, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.2 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 123, elevated creatinine levels, and hyponatremia. 

The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hospital-acquired pneumonia, influenza, PJP, anemia, leukopenia, abdominal distension, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myeloma, influenza, PJP, and pneumococcus.
- He underwent dialysis line placement and hemodialysis with 1.5L removed, without complications.
- PEEP was decreased from 8 to 5, but oxygenation worsened, so it was increased back to 10.
- The patient is sedated and unable to provide history.
- Allergies include Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl) and orthostasis.
- Last doses of antibiotics were given at 11:33 AM (Vancomycin), 12:52 PM (Cefipime), 08:15 AM (Azithromycin), and 02:41 PM (Bactrim).
- The patient is receiving infusions of Fentanyl and other ICU medications.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for pain which the patient does not have.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8C (98.3F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/44 to 141/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 insp/min, SpO2 of 92%, and sinus rhythm.
- The patient's weight is currently 96.1 kg, with a height of 68 inches.
- CVP is 11 mmHg, total fluid input is 3,574 mL, and total fluid output is 1,629 mL.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, Vt set at 470 mL, RR set at 32, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and ABG results indicating pH 7.42, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 173, and Ve of 17.4 L/min.
- Physical examination reveals pupils disconjugate, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and no peripheral pulses in the extremities.
- Neurologic examination shows the patient is sedated and not assessed.
- Labs indicate elevated WBC count of 102 K/uL, decreased Hct of 22.8%, and increased creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL.
- Radiology results are not mentioned in the provided information.
- Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP), viral pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on CVVHD, and multiple myeloma.

   response to minimal lowering of PEEP, that there is inducible cardiac
   ischemia leading to worsened ventricular compliance and acute pulmonary
   edema.

   Total time spent:
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to multiple pulmonary infections (PCP, Pneumococcus) and possible pulmonary edema. He also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), multiple myeloma (cancer), and pancytopenia. The patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has respiratory failure, which can worsen if not managed properly. Adjustments in PEEP and oxygenation may be necessary.
2. Pulmonary Edema: Given the possibility of inducible cardiac ischemia leading to worsened ventricular compliance and acute pulmonary edema, close monitoring for signs of fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction is required.
3. Renal Failure: As the patient has ESRD, there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function. Hemodialysis should be continued to maintain negative fluid balance.
4. Infections: The patient has multiple pulmonary infections, including PCP and Pneumococcus. Antibiotic therapy should be continued as per the ID plan.
5. Multiple Myeloma: Although no acute intervention is required for multiple myeloma at present, monitoring for any complications related to the underlying malignancy is necessary.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood cell counts increase the risk of bleeding and infection. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man with respiratory failure secondary to multiple pulmonary infections (PCP, Pneumococcus) as well as possible pulmonary edema. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition requiring immediate medical attention. This may worsen if not properly managed.

2. Inducible Cardiac Ischemia: The response to minimal lowering of PEEP suggests the possibility of inducible cardiac ischemia leading to worsened ventricular compliance and acute pulmonary edema. This needs to be closely monitored and managed.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP), viral infection, and hospital-acquired bacteria. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued and adjusted as necessary based on culture results.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hemodialysis is required to keep the patient negative. The femoral dialysis catheter should be removed.

5. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, but no acute intervention is required at this time.

6. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is multifactorial. It should be closely monitored, and transfusion should be considered when the patient reaches the appropriate threshold.

7. Other Complications: The"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   P/F improved today with improved oxygenation today.
   CXR shows bilateral effusions and edema which may have contributed to
   difficulty weaning vent. No ischemic changes post decrease in PEEP
   yesterday.
   --Decrease PEEP to 5 today repeat PM ABG
   --Would attempt to remove additional fluid at HD today if
   hemodynamically tolerated, will d/w renal.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   BP stable, off pressors. Made small amount of urine yesterday, follow
   today. Target MAP>65.  Repeat SVO2 today.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   D/C vancomycin and azithromycin today.
   Pneumococus in sputum would be covered by cefepime.
   Galactomannan detectable but <0.5; Note that patient has been on Zosyn
   this admission so may have false + fungal antigen.
 Influenza
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Changed from Bactrim to primaquine/clindamycin due to concern that
   Bactrim was contributing to cytopenias.
 Anemia
   Hct stable, transfuse 2units PRBC at dialysis today. No evidence of
   active bleeding (did have heme+ stool earlier in the week) follow Hct,
   continue PPI. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   Improved today. Cytoxan last received on [**2-26**],  near expected period for
   WBC nadir
   Multiple other reasons for cytopenia including influenza infection or
   other medications such as bactrim.
 Abdominal distension
   Slightly increased today without peritoneal signs, passing small amount
   of stool. Repeat KUB, consider repeat PO narcan. Replete lytes prn.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, continue low dose beta blocker as BP tolerates.
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Onc recs appreciated.  s/p IVIG
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Plan for HD today. Increased urine output yesterday. Renal
   recommendations appreciated. Renal dose meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress caused by influenza, PJP, and pneumococcus in the sputum. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and antiviral medications. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/49 mmHg to 154/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 470 mL, respiratory rate set at 32 breaths per minute, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and an ABG result of 7.40/38/89.

The patient has bilateral effusions on chest X-ray and is receiving fluids and blood transfusions as needed. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, and renal dysfunction. The patient's condition is being monitored closely, and appropriate treatments are being administered for pneumonia, sepsis, and other complications related to multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to the combination of influenza, PJP, and pneumococcus infection. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation parameters are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with respiratory failure from influenza, PCP, and Pneumococcus. He is currently sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has multiple medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), multiple myeloma (cancer), and pancytopenia. He is being treated with various antibiotics for pneumonia and is on dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he does not regain spontaneous respirations or if there is a progression of his underlying lung infections.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by PCP, Pneumococcus, and viral infections. These infections can lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia, characterized by low white blood cell count, low red blood cell count, and low platelet count, may increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's ESRD requires ongoing dialysis treatment. Complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and buildup of waste products can occur if dialysis is not properly managed.
5. Multiple myeloma: The patient's multiple myeloma increases the risk of infections, anemia, and bone fractures.
6. Sedation and weaning from mechanical ventilation: The patient's prolonged sedation may make it difficult to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man with respiratory failure due to influenza, PCP, and pneumococcus. The patient has several medical conditions including end-stage renal disease, multiple myeloma, and pancytopenia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedated.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered if necessary.

2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of multiple lines and catheters, there is a risk of developing a nosocomial bloodstream infection. Regular monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters, along with prompt identification and treatment of any suspected infections, is crucial.

3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments and appropriate interventions to prevent and manage pressure ulcers are important.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness are risk factors for DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin should be continued. Additionally, surveillance for signs and symptoms of DVT/PE, along with appropriate imaging and treatment, should"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing influenza symptoms along with pneumonia caused by pneumococcus and PJP (Pneumocystis jiroveci). 

During the 24-hour period, the patient underwent dialysis in the morning and received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to anemia. The patient was also sedated but showed signs of pain, so fentanyl/versed was restarted at lower doses, while methadone was withheld. An attempt to wean PEEP to 5 failed due to poor ABG (arterial blood gas) results, leading to an increase in PEEP back to 8. The patient's blood pressure was elevated at 180s with a heart rate in the 90s, prompting an increase in beta-blocker medication.

The patient's allergies include Flomax (oral) and orthostasis. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Bactrim (SMX/TMP) at 02:41 PM, vancomycin at 02:00 PM, azithromycin at 08:00 PM, clindamycin at 03:30 PM, and cefepime at 04:00 PM.

The patient is currently receiving propofol infusion at 10 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications. No"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   P/F decreased today. Did not tolerated decrease in PEEP yesterday, may
   be [**2-26**] pulmonary edema (vs pna).  Also consider whether cardiac
   ischemic could be contributory to difficulty with weaning vent.
   --Reattempt decrease PEEP today with repeat ABG.
   --Check EKG now, and repeat when PEEP has been decreased to assess for
   ST/T changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
   --Would attempt to remove additional fluid at HD today if
   hemodynamically tolerated, will d/w renal.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   BP stable, off pressors. Continues to make essentially no urine so
   can
t follow urine output as marker of end organ perfusion.
   Target MAP>65.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Given increased R sided opacity and failure to improve oxygenation
   significantly will continue current abx. Pneumococus in sputum will be
   covered on current regimen.
   Continue vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin. Dose vancomycin with HD
   per renal. If clinically improved tomorrow, would consider
   discontinuing vancomycin or azithromycin.
   Galactomannan detectable but <0.5; Note that patient has been on Zosyn
   this admission so may have false + fungal antigen.
 Influenza
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Continue bactrim, steroids.
 Anemia
   Hct stable, will hold off on transfusion at this time. No evidence of
   active bleeding (did have heme+ stool earlier in the week) follow Hct,
   continue PPI. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   Cytoxan last received on [**2-26**], this is near expected period for WBC
   nadir.  Check ANC. Multiple other reasons for cytopenia including
   influenza infection or other medications such as bactrim. D/w oncology
   regarding neupogen plans.
 Abdominal distension
   Improved, passing stool and tolerating tube feeds.  Replete lytes prn.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, continue low dose beta blocker as BP tolerates.
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Onc recs appreciated.  s/p IVIG
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Still essentially anuric, see [**3-6**] for differential dx discussion. On

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 68-year-old male patient with myeloma admitted with respiratory failure due to influenza, pneumococcus, and PJP infections.
- The patient received dialysis, blood transfusion, and various antibiotics (Bactrim, Vancomycin, Azithromycin, Clindamycin, Cefepime).
- Sedation was stopped and restarted at lower doses due to pain.
- The patient's blood pressure was high, so a beta blocker was increased.
- The patient's wife is expected to visit on Saturday.
- The patient has multiple medical conditions including pneumonia, sepsis, anemia, leukopenia, abdominal distension, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient may have pulmonary edema contributing to respiratory failure, which could be worsened by fluid overload or cardiac ischemia.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: There is a possibility of cardiac ischemia contributing to the difficulty with weaning from the ventilator.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is still essentially anuric (producing little urine), indicating ongoing renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient has multiple infections including influenza, pneumococcus, and PJP, which need to be treated appropriately.
5. Bleeding: The patient has heme-positive stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient has stable hem"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Good RSBI today with adequate oxygenation, plan for SBT.  Repeat CXR.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Off pressors. Continues to make essentially no urine so can
t follow
   urine output as marker of end organ perfusion.
   Target MAP>65.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Afebrile without leukocytosis off of vancomycin and azithromycin.
   Continuing on cefepime, consider narrowing to ceftriaxone as only
   bacterial [**Doctor Last Name **] isolated has been pneumococcus (ctx sensitive); wil
   discuss with ID.
   Galactomannan detectable but <0.5; Note that patient has been on Zosyn
   this admission so may have false + fungal antigen.
 Hypertension and anxiety
   Suspect that hypertension is [**2-26**] lightening sedation, consider
   withdrawal from methadone. Will continue propofol as needed and add
   back methadone today. Will start labetalol drip if needed if remains
   hypertensive despite adding back sedation. Repeat EKG.
 Influenza
   Continue oseltamivir to complete 14d course
 PJP
   Continue primaquine and clindamycin, steroids.
 Anemia
   Hct stable, s/p transfusion yesterday at HD. No evidence of active
   bleeding (did have heme+ stool earlier in admission) follow Hct,
   continue PPI. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Leukopenia
   WBC improved, unclear if causally related to bactrim could be [**2-26**]
   cytoxan versus other medications. Follow.
 Abdominal distension
   Improved, passing stool and tolerating tube feeds.  Replete lytes prn.
 h/o Atrial fibrillation
   In SR currently, continue low dose beta blocker as BP tolerates.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with myeloma admitted with respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza, pneumococcus, and PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the morning and underwent dialysis. The patient's sedation was stopped, and they seemed to be in pain, so fentanyl/versed were restarted at lower doses; methadone was held.

The patient's blood pressure was high, reaching 180s with a heart rate in the 90s. Beta blockers were increased to manage hypertension. The patient's wife is expected to visit on Saturday.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (cefepime, clindamycin, primaquine, oseltamivir), propofol, prednisone taper, allopurinol, protonix, tricorn, and heparin SQ.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 240/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's mixed venous O2 saturation is 93%, and their total fluid input/output balance shows a negative balance of 2,033 mL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including pneumonia caused by PCP, pneumococcus, influenza, and viral pneumonia. The patient also has pancytopenia, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction (resolved), end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and altered awareness.

The patient is currently on several medications including propofol, protonix, atrovent, heparin, insulin sliding scale, prednisone, colace, aspirin, folate, tricor, primaquine, and metoprolol. The patient is also receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has been holding tube feeds in case of extubation.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, heart rate of 73 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2 of 117 mmHg, and HCO3- of 27 mEq/L. The patient's white blood cell count is 2.3 K/uL, hemoglobin is 10.1 g/dL, platelet count is 117 K/uL, creatinine is 6.2 mg/dL, and blood glucose is 128 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished and anxious. His lungs show clear breath sounds with central ronchi noted on inspiration and expiration. He has non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and distention. His extremities show trace edema bilaterally. His neurological examination is significant for sedation and the inability to assess movement or tone.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not tolerate weaning off PEEP, potential infections due to the use of immunosuppressive medications such as prednisone and primaquine, further deterioration of renal function, and possible cardiac issues given the presence of hypertension and multiple myeloma.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, and blood counts, while also considering the possibility of infection and cardiac complications. Regular communication with the interdisciplinary team and appropriate adjustments to the patient's treatment plan will be necessary to manage these potential complications and ensure the best possible outcome for the patient."

   Total time spent: 45
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to influenza, PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci), and pneumococcus. He also has pancytopenia, sepsis with organ dysfunction (resolved), pneumonia (PCP, viral, and hospital-acquired), end-stage renal disease on HD, multiple myeloma (not actively treating), and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still struggling with respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) value of 16. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has multiple types of pneumonia, including PCP, viral, and hospital-acquired. These infections can worsen respiratory function and may require additional antibiotics or interventions.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has low levels of all blood cell types (pancytopenia). This condition increases the risk of bleeding, infection, and other complications related to compromised immune and hematological systems.

4. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence, especially if new infections occur or if existing infections worsen.

5. End-stage renal disease: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) for end-stage renal disease. There is a risk of fluid"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to influenza, PCP, and pneumococcus. He has been improving slowly but still requires mechanical ventilation. The patient also has pancytopenia, which is improving since stopping Bactrim. He has a history of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, pneumonia (PCP and viral), hospital-acquired pneumonia, end-stage renal disease on HD, multiple myeloma (not actively treating), and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to a combination of factors including influenza, PCP, and pneumococcus infection. Continued monitoring and management of his respiratory status will be necessary.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is improving since stopping Bactrim. It is important to monitor his blood counts and adjust treatment accordingly.

3. Severe Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction has resolved, it can still pose a risk for complications. Close monitoring of his vital signs and organ functions will be necessary.

4. Pneumonia (PCP and Viral): The patient has both PCP and viral pneumonia. Treatment with prednisone and clindamycin/primaquine is ongoing. Regular follow-up with DFA and consideration of d/c precautions if negative will be important.

5. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient also has"

   Assessment and Plan
   A & P: 68 you M with respiratory failure [**2-26**] to influenza, PJP.  Also
   with renal failure on HD.
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Failed SBT yesterday with HTN to 240's and
   sats to 80's, extubation held as patient was not following commands of
   son. EKG at that time showed diffuse ST depressions that resolved with
   drop in BP after nitro gtt.  CE did not bump.  This morning patient is
   sedated and unresponsive.
   CXR unchanged from yesterday's post SBT trial with pulmonary edema vs
   worsening effusion
   -RSBI 12 this morning
   -would d/c sedation and attempt to wean to PSV
   -would also re-evaluate neurological status with hopes of extubation
   2.  Sepsis:  Off pressors, anuric, renal following
   -target MAP>65
   3.  Pneumonia:  Continues to be afebrile with WBC 4.2
   -on cefepime, ID recommends narrowing, would change to ceftriaxone as
   pneumococcus is sensitive and does not need coverage for gram
   negatives
   -vacn and azithro d/c'ed
   4.  HTN: BP's to 240's yesterday in setting of decreased sedation and
   SBT trial.
   -SBP's in 130's currently
   -can add back nitro gtt in setting of weaning if necessary as patient
   responded well
   5.  PJP: Day 10 of treatment on primaquine and clindamycin, steroids
   -continue current managment
   6.  Influenza: Completed 9 day course
   -DFA negative, oseltamivir d/c'ed yesterday per ID as DFA negative
   -droplet precautions d/c'ed
   7.  Anemia:  HCT 24.8 today down from 29 yesterday
   -repeat pm HCT
   -no evidence of active bleeding  BP's stable (had trace heme + stools
   earlier in admission)
   -continue following HCT and transfuse <21
   -continue PPI
   8.  Leukopenia:  Resolving at 4.2 today
   -unclear [**Name2 (NI) 172**] includes s/o cytoxan treatment, bactrim, abx
   -continue to monitor
   9.  Abdominal Distension:   Exam benign today, having bowel movements
   -replete electrolytes prn
   10.  Renal Failure: Likely [**2-26**] multiple myeloma and sepsis. Continues
   to be anuric.  HD yesterday with 5L off, tolerated well
   -appreciate renal recs, plan for TIW HD, next HD Tuesday
   -medications renally dosed
   11.  H/o Atrial Fibrillation;
   -in NSR currently
   -continue on metoprolol 75mg po tid as BP's tolerate
   12.  Multiple Myeloma: s/p IVIg per onc
   -appreciate onc recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple myeloma admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to influenza, PJP, and pneumococcus. The patient underwent hemodialysis and a spontaneous breathing trial but was unsuccessful due to hypertension and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient's neurological status is unresponsive, and they are currently sedated. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. The patient's renal function is impaired, and they are anuric. They are also leukopenic and anemic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, as evidenced by the failed spontaneous breathing trial. Continued monitoring and support are necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of infection (PJP and pneumonia) and impaired immune function (multiple myeloma).
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by pneumococcus. Antibiotic therapy should be continued to treat the infection.
4. Hypertension: The patient experienced severe hypertension during the spontaneous breathing trial. Blood pressure management is crucial to prevent further complications.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, likely due to multiple myeloma and sepsis. Regular monitoring of renal function and ongoing dialysis as planned are important.
6. Anemia and Leukopenia: The patient has anemia and leukopenia."

   Assessment and Plan
   A & P: 68 you M with respiratory failure [**2-26**] to influenza, PJP.  Also
   with renal failure on HD.
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Failed SBT yesterday with HTN to 240's and
   sats to 80's, extubation held as patient was not following commands of
   son. EKG at that time showed diffuse ST depressions that resolved with
   drop in BP after nitro gtt.  CE did not bump.  This morning patient is
   sedated and unresponsive. CXR unchanged from yesterday's post SBT trial
   with pulmonary edema vs worsening effusion
   -RSBI 12 this morning
   -d/c sedation and attempt to wean to PSV with careful bloodpressure
   monitoring
   -also re-evaluate neurological status with hopes of extubation
   2.  Sepsis:  Off pressors, anuric, renal following
   -target MAP>65
   3.  Pneumonia:  Continues to be afebrile with WBC 4.2
   -on cefepime, ID recommends narrowing, change to ceftriaxone as
   pneumococcus is sensitive and does not need coverage for gram negatives
   -vacn and azithro d/c'ed
   4.  HTN: BP's to 240's yesterday in setting of decreased sedation and
   SBT trial.
   -SBP's in 130's currently
   -can add back nitro gtt in setting of weaning if necessary as patient
   responded well
   -on metoprolo 75 mg tid with hr in 60
s, would try another [**Doctor Last Name **] is
   further bp control necessary
   5.  PJP: Day 10 of treatment on primaquine and clindamycin, steroids
   -continue current managment
   6.  Influenza: Completed 9 day course
   -DFA negative, oseltamivir d/c'ed yesterday per ID as DFA negative
   -droplet precautions d/c'ed
   7.  Anemia:  HCT 24.8 today down from 29 yesterday
   -repeat pm HCT
   -no evidence of active bleeding  BP's stable (had trace heme + stools
   earlier in admission)
   -continue following HCT and [**Doctor Last Name 173**] and transfuse <21
   -continue PPI
   8.  Leukopenia:  Resolving at 4.2 today
   -unclear [**Name2 (NI) 172**] includes s/o cytoxan treatment, bactrim, abx
   -continue to monitor
   9.  Abdominal Distension:   Exam benign today, having bowel movements
   -replete electrolytes prn
   10.  Renal Failure: Likely [**2-26**] multiple myeloma and sepsis. Continues
   to be anuric.  HD yesterday with 5L off, tolerated well
   -appreciate renal recs, plan for TIW HD, next HD Tuesday
   -medications renally dosed
   11.  H/o Atrial Fibrillation:
   -in NSR currently
   -continue on metoprolol 75mg po tid as BP's tolerate
   12.  Multiple Myeloma: s/p IVIg per onc
   -appreciate onc recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple myeloma who was admitted with respiratory failure due to influenza, PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), and pneumococcus. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) and showed good respiratory system function. However, he became hypertensive during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and did not pass the test. The patient's blood pressure remained high, and his oxygen saturation levels were in the high 80s. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed diffuse ST depressions that resolved with better blood pressure control using nitroglycerin. The patient's cardiac enzymes were flat. A chest X-ray indicated increased effusion or pulmonary edema. 

The patient's allergies include Flomax (tamsulosin Hcl) and antibiotics. He is currently on several medications, including cefepime, clindamycin, primaquine, prednisone taper, methadone, metoprolol, allopurinol, tricorn, insulin, protonix, and heparin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the respiratory failure. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62-115 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/68 mmHg to 241/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by influenza, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The patient has pancytopenia, respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, PCP pneumonia, viral pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. 

The patient underwent hemodialysis with 5 liters removed and showed good respiratory system compliance (RSBI). However, he became hypertensive with blood pressure readings in the 240s and did not follow commands even when a son was present. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were in the high 80s, and an EKG showed diffuse ST depressions that resolved with better blood pressure control using nitro drip. Cardiac enzymes were flat, and the patient was placed back on AC. A chest X-ray suggested increased effusion versus pulmonary edema. 

The patient's allergies include Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl) and antibiotics. He is currently receiving multiple medications including prednisone taper, methadone IV q4, metoprolol PO TID, allopurinol, tricorn, insulin SS, protonix, and heparin SQ.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure caused by influenza, PJP, and pneumococcus. The patient's flu antigen test was negative, so droplet precautions were discontinued and oseltamivir was stopped. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) with 5 liters removed and had good respiratory system compliance but became hypertensive with readings in the 240s. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) was attempted, but the patient did not follow commands reliably even with a son present. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were in the high 80s, and EKG showed diffuse ST depressions that resolved with better blood pressure control using nitro drip. The patient's cardiac enzymes were flat, and acetaminophen was restarted. Chest X-ray indicated increased effusion or pulmonary edema. The patient has allergies to Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl) and orthostasis. The patient received various antibiotics including vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime, and clindamycin. The patient's medical history is significant for multiple myeloma. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the inability to answer pain questions. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.8°C to 37.4°C, heart rate between 62 and 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M w/MM, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with respiratory failure secondary
   to influenza, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pneumococcal pneumoina.  Now improving somewhat
   although had a setback last night with an episode of flash pulmonary
   edema.
 PANCYTOPENIA:  Hct went from 29 to 24 yesterday but without any
   clinical signs of bleeding.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microangiopathy during
   hypertensive episode yesterday.
   - repeat hct, guaiac stools
   - WBC stable, may have been decreased secondary to bactrim.  Platelets
   also improved.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Due to multiple
   infections listed above.  Episode of flash pulmonary edema yesterday
   was likely due to hypertension which may have been due to agitation
   versus narcotic withdrawal.  Responded both to methadone and nitro gtt
   (now off).
   - d/c propofol today and try SBT - if passes with acceptable BP
   control, would extubate
 ECG changes:  Cardiac enzymes flat, changes resolved with improved BP
   control.  Likely demand in setting of hypertension.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):  Resolved.
 PNEUMONIA, PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECI (PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 127**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 128**]
   PNEUMONIA): On clinda, primaquine, and prednisone.
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL:  repeat DFA negative, off precautions.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP): Change cefepime to
   ceftriaxone.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure secondary to influenza, PCP, and pneumococcal pneumonia. The patient has shown improvement but experienced a setback last night with an episode of flash pulmonary edema. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to multiple infections. Flash pulmonary edema occurred yesterday, which was likely caused by hypertension possibly triggered by agitation or narcotic withdrawal. The patient responded well to methadone and nitroglycerin.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels decreased from 29% to 24% yesterday without any clinical signs of bleeding. This indicates a possible pancytopenia, which is characterized by a decrease in red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Further investigations such as repeating hct and guaiac stools are recommended.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although not diagnosed as ARDS, the patient's respiratory failure could progress to ARDS if not managed properly. ARDS is a severe lung condition characterized by widespread inflammation in the lungs.

4. Sepsis: The patient had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, but it has since resolved. It is important to closely monitor for any signs of recurrent sepsis or infection.

   68 y/o M w/MM, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with respiratory failure secondary
   to influenza, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pneumococcal pneumoina.  Now improving somewhat
   although had a setback last night with an episode of flash pulmonary
   edema.
 PANCYTOPENIA:  Hct went from 29 to 24 yesterday but without any
   clinical signs of bleeding.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microangiopathy during
   hypertensive episode yesterday.

   also improved.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Due to multiple
   infections listed above.  Episode of flash pulmonary edema yesterday
   was likely due to hypertension which may have been due to agitation
   versus narcotic withdrawal.  Responded both to methadone and nitro gtt
   (now off).
   - d/c propofol today and try SBT - if passes with acceptable BP
   control, would extubate
 ECG changes:  Cardiac enzymes flat, changes resolved with improved BP
   control.  Likely demand in setting of hypertension.

   Total time spent:
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to influenza, PCP, and pneumococcal pneumonia. The patient's condition has been improving but had a setback last night with an episode of flash pulmonary edema. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently supported by mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not adequately treated or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient's hematocrit levels have decreased from 29% to 24% without any clinical signs of bleeding. This may indicate pancytopenia, which can lead to an increased risk of infections, bleeding, and other complications.

3. Microangiopathy: The patient experienced microangiopathy during a hypertensive episode yesterday. This condition involves small blood vessel damage and can lead to various complications such as organ dysfunction and poor tissue perfusion.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is on hemodialysis due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There is a risk of worsening renal function if the underlying cause is not managed appropriately or if there are complications such as acute kidney injury.

5. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. This condition can"

","The patient's medical history includes multiple myeloma (cancer), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure secondary to influenza, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), and pneumococcal pneumonia. 

Currently, the patient is being treated for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia with clindamycin, primaquine, and prednisone. The patient also has a murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, which may put them at risk for pulmonary edema. Beta blockers and vasodilators are being used to manage this risk. 

The patient experienced an episode of flash pulmonary edema yesterday, which was likely due to hypertension. The hypertension was managed with methadone and nitroglycerin. The patient's platelet count has improved, and their WBC count is stable. 

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to multiple infections, including influenza, PCP, and pneumococcal pneumonia. The ECG changes observed were likely demand-related in the setting of hypertension. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by their end-stage renal disease. They are on hemodialysis. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 143/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus rhythm. 

The patient's laboratory results show a hematocrit of 24.8%, white blood cell count of 4.5 K/uL, platelet count of 161 K/uL, creatinine of 4.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 129 mg/dL, and anion gap of 24.8. Other lab values are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal. 

The patient's current plan includes discontinuing propofol and performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). If the SBT is successful and the patient's blood pressure is controlled, extubation will be considered. The patient's fluids will be managed to minimize the risk of pulmonary edema. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema, worsening renal function, and sepsis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and allergies to Flomax and Bactrim. The patient's chief complaint is an inability to breathe. Upon admission, the patient presented with respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP), viral pneumonia, and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient also has pancytopenia and is on various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and nitroglycerin infusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multiple types of pneumonia, including PCP, viral pneumonia, and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. These infections can worsen the patient's respiratory condition and increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic inflammatory response due to an infection. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and may require intensive care management.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis treatment. If the patient develops complications related to dialysis or if their renal function further deteriorates, it can lead to additional health issues.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has"

   68 y/o M w/MM, admitted with respiratory failure [**2-26**] influenza, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pneumococcus.  Ventilator weaning is persistently limited by
   hypertension.
 PANCYTOPENIA:  WBC dropped slightly today although other cell lines
   stable to improved.  Will add on differential, trend WBC.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Initially due to
   infection, now appears to be limited by pulmonary edema and poorly
   controlled hypertension.  It is unclear whether his hypertension is due
   to transient LV noncompliance in the setting of myocardial ischemia
   versus agitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and malignancy. He was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to 2-26 influenza, PCP, and pneumococcus. The patient's respiratory failure is now limited by pulmonary edema and poorly controlled hypertension. His hypertension is being managed with medications such as metoprolol and nitroglycerin. The patient also has pancytopenia, which is being closely monitored with frequent blood tests. He is currently on ventilatory support due to acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if the underlying causes such as pulmonary edema and hypertension are not adequately managed. There is a risk of worsening hypoxemia and the need for prolonged ventilatory support.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia (low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) can increase the risk of infection, bleeding, and other complications related to low blood cell counts.
3. Hypertension: The patient's poorly controlled hypertension may lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or organ damage if not managed effectively.
4. Sepsis: Although the patient's severe sepsis has resolved, there is still a risk of infection-related complications, particularly if the immune system remains compromised.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) puts him at risk for further renal deterioration and the need for ongoing dialysis.
6. Cancer (Multiple Myeloma): The patient's underlying multiple myeloma increases the risk of complications related to malignancy, including bone fractures, infections, and impaired immune function."

   68 y/o M w/MM, admitted with respiratory failure [**2-26**] influenza, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pneumococcus.  Ventilator weaning is persistently limited by
   hypertension.
 PANCYTOPENIA:  WBC dropped slightly today although other cell lines
   stable to improved.  Will add on differential, trend WBC.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Initially due to
   infection, now appears to be limited by pulmonary edema and poorly
   controlled hypertension.  It is unclear whether his hypertension is due
   to transient LV noncompliance in the setting of myocardial ischemia
   versus agitation.
   - wean sedation today
   - taking 3.5 kg off with HD this AM
   - SBT after HD and hope to extubate today-main barrier is mental status
   and secretions which have shown a trend to improvement.  At this time
   patient agitation and secondary hypertension indicate requirement for
   either increased sedation or move to extubation which clinically has
   indications of reasonable certainty of success.
 HYPERTENSION:  On metoprolol.  will add hydralizine for afterload
   reduction.  Wean nitro gtt as tolerated.  Would expect some improvement
   post dialysis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and previous infections including influenza, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. The patient was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation due to persistent weaning limitations caused by hypertension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/68 mmHg to 195/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's laboratory results show pancytopenia with a white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 157 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Initially due to infection, now appears to be limited by pulmonary edema and poorly controlled hypertension. Weaning sedation is planned today, and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) after hemodialysis (HD) is anticipated with hopes of extubation today, considering improvement in mental status and secretions.
2. Hypertension: On metop"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Due to infection with multiple organisms
   -extubated successfully yesterday
   -on face tent and nasal cannula, O2 at 95%
   -on IV methadone [**Last Name (LF) 177**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] change to po once NG tube placed of 30mg
   once a day, then 20mg once a day and 10mg once a day
   2.  Altered Mental Status:  Likely [**2-26**] to sedation and slow recovery
   from infectio, however concern for acute bleed given several days of
   high blood pressures and concern for HSV CNS disease given lip lesion
   -frequent neuro checks
   -if unimproved or worsened this afternoon, would get head CT to r/o
   acute bleed and do further workup if warrented
   -will also start acyclovir on HD dosing empirically for HSV meningitis
   -will curbside ID for necessity of lip lesion culture/LP
   -continue methadone [**Month/Day (2) 177**] as above
   2.  Sepsis:  Off pressors, anuric, renal following
   -target MAP>65
   3.  Pneumonia:  Continues to be afebrile with WBC 7.6 today
   -continue Ceftriaxone for total of 2 weeks (last day [**3-17**])
   4.  HTN: continues to run high
   -increase metoprolol to 15mg IV
   -can titrate up current does of hydralizine of 20mg IV
   -will change to po medications after NGT
   5.  PJP: On primaquine and clindamycin, steroids
   -continue current managment for total of 3 weeks (last day [**3-24**])
   -primaquine is po only, will give after NGT
   -ID has signed off, appreciate recs
   6.  Influenza: Completed 9 day course of Oseltamivir
   7.  Anemia:  HCT 26.3 stable today
   -continue following HCT and transfuse <21
   -continue PPI
   8.  Leukopenia:  Resolving at 7.6 today, up from 3.6 yesterday
   -continue to monitor
   9.  Abdominal Distension:   Exam benign today, having bowel movements
   -replete electrolytes prn
   10.  Renal Failure: [**2-26**] to MM, worsened in setting of sepsis. Continues
   to be anuric.  HD yesterday with 3.5L off, HD again today.
   -appreciate renal recs
   -medications renally dosed
   11.  H/o Atrial Fibrillation: Mag low today, exhibiting bigeminy on 12
   lead starting before HD, no increase in agitation
   -replete lytes and closely monitor
   -continue on metoprolol 75mg po tid as BP's tolerate
   12.  Multiple Myeloma: s/p IVIg per onc
   -appreciate onc recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to influenza, PJP, and an unspecified organism. The patient received dialysis, which removed 3.5 liters of fluid. Improved blood pressure control was achieved with higher doses of hydralazine. The patient was extubated and started on a methadone taper. Allergies include Flomax, Bactrim, and orthostasis. The patient has pancytopenia and is currently on antibiotics. Nitroglycerin infusion is being administered, along with other medications. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3°C, heart rate 114 bpm, blood pressure 147/86 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals confusion, crackles at the lung bases, and upper lip bleeding. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia, anemia, renal failure, and multiple myeloma. The patient is currently receiving treatment for respiratory failure, pneumonia, PCP, influenza, hypertension, anemia, leukopenia, renal failure, and multiple myeloma. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin, arterial and multi-lumen lines, dialysis catheter, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP precautions.

   68 y/o M with MM, renal failure, admitted with respiratory failure due
   to multiple different infections (influenza, [**Year (4 digits) 174**], PCP), now
   extubated.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Likely related to sedation.  Is slowly
   improving since extubation yesterday.  The combination of hypertension
   and altered mental status is concerning for intracranial process,
   however he has been hypertensive throughout his stay, is following
   commands, and his mental status is improving.
   -          see below regarding potential HSV
   -          [**Year (4 digits) 177**] methadone
 will change to oral once he has NGT.  D/w
   pharmacy.
 ORAL ULCER:  Likely HSV.
   - in setting of HSV oral ulcer and altered mental status, need to
   consider HSV encephalitis
   - needs CT prior to LP to r/o cause of increased ICP
   - LP
   - culture lip.  Treat empirically with acyclovir for now (at systemic
   doses until CSF is back).
 PANCYTOPENIA:  WBC improving since stopping bactrim.
 HYPERTENSION:  As below, wean nitro gtt, increase beta-blocker,
   hydral.  No ischemic changes on ECG from this AM.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Now extubated, but with a
   high oxygen requirement.  Likely superimposed flash pulmonary edema in
   setting of multiple infections.
   - cont to remove fluid with HD
   - aggressive bp control - increase beta-blocker, wean nitro as
   tolerated, and continue hydralazine (no ACE per renal as they feel his
   renal fxn may recover)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):  Resolved.
 PNEUMONIA, PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECI (PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 127**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 128**]
   PNEUMONIA):  Cont clinda/primaquine, prednisone 20 mg daily (total 21

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, renal failure, and infections including influenza, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), viral pneumonia, and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient was recently extubated and is now on supplemental oxygen. They have a lip lesion that is progressing, which is likely due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The altered mental status is improving since extubation but may be related to sedation. There is concern for an intracranial process, such as HSV encephalitis, especially in the setting of an oral ulcer and altered mental status. A computed tomography (CT) scan prior to lumbar puncture (LP) should be done to rule out increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The patient should be treated empirically with acyclovir for HSV infection.

The patient also has pancytopenia, with improving white blood cell count since stopping bactrim. Hypertension is present and should be managed by weaning nitroglycerin, increasing beta-blocker, and continuing hydralazine.

The patient experienced respiratory failure but is now extubated. Flash pulmonary edema is likely in the setting of multiple infections. Fluid removal through hemodialysis (HD) should be continued, and aggressive blood pressure control should be maintained.

The patient had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M with MM, renal failure, admitted with respiratory failure due
   to multiple different infections (influenza, [**Year (4 digits) 174**], PCP), now
   extubated.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Likely related to sedation.  Is slowly
   improving since extubation yesterday.  The combination of hypertension
   and altered mental status is concerning for intracranial process,
   however he has been hypertensive throughout his stay, is following
   commands, and his mental status is improving.
   -          full neuro exam - see below regarding potential HSV
   -          taper methadone
 will change to oral once he has NGT.  D/w
   pharmacy.
 ORAL ULCER:  Likely HSV.
   - in setting of HSV oral ulcer and altered mental status, need to
   consider HSV encephalitis - will d/w ID, and likely LP today,
   empirically start HSV encephalitis treatment
   - needs CT prior to LP to r/o cause of increased ICP
 PANCYTOPENIA:  WBC improving since stopping bactrim.
 HYPERTENSION:  As below, wean nitro gtt, increase beta-blocker,
   hydral.  No ischemic changes on ECG from this AM.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Now extubated, but with a
   high oxygen requirement.  Likely superimposed flash pulmonary edema in
   setting of multiple infections.
   - cont to remove fluid with HD
   - aggressive bp control - increase beta-blocker, wean nitro as
   tolerated, and continue hydralazine (no ACE per renal as they feel his
   renal fxn may recover)

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including multiple myeloma, renal failure, and respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by various infections such as influenza, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 157/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His temperature is within normal range at 37.3°C.

The patient was extubated yesterday and is now breathing spontaneously. However, he requires a high level of oxygen support. His mental status has improved since extubation but he is still sedated. There is a concern for an intracranial process, but further evaluation is needed.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. HSV Encephalitis: The patient has an oral ulcer that is likely due to HSV. In the setting of altered mental status, HSV encephalitis needs to be considered, and treatment should be started empirically.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient may have flash pulmonary edema on top of his multiple infections, leading to ongoing respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis with organ dysfunction has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence if infections persist or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with myeloma admitted with respiratory distress due to influenza, sputum positive for PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii), and another unidentified organism. The patient underwent dialysis and experienced ventricular bigeminy but maintained stable blood pressure. There was bleeding from the mouth, which is suspected to be caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), and lumbar puncture (LP) was performed to rule out HSV encephalitis. Acyclovir was started empirically.

The patient had a head CT prior to LP, which showed no bleeding or mass but revealed bifrontal fluid collections. Attempted nasogastric tube (NGT) placement was unsuccessful due to discomfort, and it is planned to reattempt in the morning with an interpreter or family present. The patient remained confused.

The patient's allergies include Flomax (tamsulosin Hcl) and orthostasis, as well as Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) and pancytopenia. The last doses of antibiotics given were ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and clindamycin.

The patient is receiving various infusions and medications, including nitroglycerin, hydralazine, metoprolol, pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who was admitted with respiratory distress due to influenza, pneumonia caused by pneumococcus and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). The patient underwent dialysis and experienced ventricular bigeminy during the procedure. He also had bleeding from mouth crusted lesions, which were concerning for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Lumbar puncture (LP) was performed to rule out HSV encephalitis, and acyclovir was started empirically. The patient attempted nasogastric tube (NGT) placement but did not tolerate it due to discomfort. It is planned to reattempt NGT placement in the morning with an interpreter or family present.

The patient remains confused and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a face tent. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/51 mmHg to 146/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 162 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, platelet count of 180 K/uL, creatinine level of 7.7 mg/dL, sodium level of 103 mEq/L,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, hypertension, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. On admission, the patient was found to have pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as pancytopenia. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture which showed elevated white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), indicating a concern for HSV meningoencephalitis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/64 mmHg to 183/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on face tent. The patient is receiving nitroglycerin infusion, hydralazine, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal sinus disease and small possible bifrontal hygromas but no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. The CSF analysis is pending microbiology results.

The patient's current assessment includes pneumonia, PCP, renal failure, encephalitis, pancytopenia, and multiple myeloma. The patient's condition remains unstable with potential medical complications such as sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, and further progression of encephalitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and pancytopenia increase the risk of developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is essential.
2. Multiorgan Dysfunction: The patient's renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia suggest possible multiorgan dysfunction. Frequent assessment of organ function and appropriate supportive care are necessary.
3. Encephalitis Progression: The patient's altered mental status and elevated white blood cell count in the CSF raise concerns for HSV meningoencephalitis. Continued monitoring for neurological deterioration and administration of appropriate antiviral therapy are recommended.
4. Pneumonia Complications: The patient's pneumonia increases the risk of complications such as respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and septic shock. Close monitoring of respiratory status and prompt intervention are crucial.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and vigilant monitoring and aggressive management are required to prevent potential medical complications and improve outcomes."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to multiple pulmonary infections. He now presents with ongoing delirium. The patient has a history of pneumonia, Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP), renal failure (ESRD), and multiple myeloma. He is currently on hemodialysis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/29-183/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on face tent. The patient's weight is 97.6 kg, with a height of 68 inches.

The patient has received various medications including nitroglycerin, hydralazine, metoprolol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, PPI, SQH, and methadone.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 721 mL total in and 155 mL PO, with output of 2500 mL total out and 300 mL urine. The patient has received blood products totaling 2500 mL.

Laboratory results indicate hemoglobin at 8.3 g/dL, white blood cell count at 162 K/uL, platelet count at 84 mg/dL, sodium at 7.7 mg/dL, potassium at 21 mEq/L, chloride at 145 mEq/L, magnesium at 25.8 %, glucose at 84 mg/dL, and calcium at 9.0 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated creatinine, TCO2, and lactic acid, as well as low albumin, LDH, and fibrinogen levels.

Imaging shows sinus disease and small possible bifrontal hygromas, but no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Fluid analysis of CSF showed 3 white and 3 red blood cells.

Assessment and plan include ongoing pneumonia, delirium, renal failure, pancytopenia, and multiple myeloma. The patient is being treated with clindamycin and primaquine for pneumonia, hemodialysis for renal failure, and monitoring for other conditions. The patient's enteral access is a priority."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a diagnosis of myeloma who was admitted with shortness of breath. Upon further evaluation, the patient tested positive for influenza, PJP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), and pneumococcus. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and myeloma. The patient has been started on various medications including diltiazem, primaquine, acyclovir, and antibiotics. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he has shown signs of crackles in the left base of his lungs and wheezes bilaterally. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count. The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Imaging studies are pending. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and he is currently on hemodialysis. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, sepsis secondary to hospital-acquired infections, further decline in kidney function, and potential neurological complications due to HSV encephalitis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myeloma admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath. He tested positive for influenza, PJP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), and pneumococcus. The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim and Flomax, and he is currently taking diltiazem 60mg PO QID.

During the 24-hour period, the patient had atrial fibrillation with a heart rate ranging from 160s, for which he was started on diltiazem. He did not undergo dialysis, but an NG tube was placed by the attending physician. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), current temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (83-139 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 157/61mmHg to 119/50mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (13-24 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight has increased from 87.6kg at admission to 97.6kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 362mL and 261mL output, with a net balance of 62mL. The patient is receiving oxygen through a face tent and has an ABG"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of pneumonia, Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP), influenza, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), altered mental status, pancytopenia, and multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU and has been treated for respiratory failure, delirium, and various other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which can lead to complications such as respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) infection: The patient is being treated for PCP infection, which can cause severe respiratory distress if not properly managed.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD, which requires ongoing dialysis to manage renal failure. Complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances may occur if dialysis is not properly managed.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient's AFib with RVR is difficult to control, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications such as stroke or heart failure.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's delirium is improving, but he still has altered mental status, which can increase the risk of falls, infections, and inadequate pain management.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with respiratory failure secondary to PCP pneumonia and influenza. He also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis (HD), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), delirium (improving), pneumonia (PCP and community-acquired), pancytopenia, multiple myeloma (malignant neoplasm), and hypertension.

The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities such as PCP pneumonia, influenza, ESRD, AFib, delirium, community-acquired pneumonia, pancytopenia, multiple myeloma, and hypertension. 

His current vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 139 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/55 mmHg to 179/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on a face tent, and sinus rhythm. The patient weighs 97.6 kg and is 68 inches tall. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 362 mL and total output of 300 mL since midnight. 

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count ranging from 3.6 to 9.1 K/uL, anemia with hemoglobin levels between 7.1 and 27.2 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with platelet counts between 150 and 354 K/uL. Other lab values show elevated creatinine levels (6.8-10.1 mg/dL), low potassium levels (2.7-3.0 mEq/L), high magnesium levels (2.7-5.0 mg/dL), and elevated lactate levels (0.8 mmol/L).

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished but has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, or pulses. 

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, hydralazine, diltiazem, primaquin, sulfonylurea, allopurinol, prednisone, Tricorn, folate, Plavix, PPI, and other ICU medications.

The assessment and plan include pneumonia, ESRD, AFib with RVR, delirium, renal failure, altered mental status, pancytopenia, multiple myeloma, and hypertension. The patient is receiving treatment for PCP pneumonia with clindamycin and primaquine, tapering steroids, and completing ceftriaxone. He has been treated for influenza with tamiflu. The patient is on HD for renal failure and is being transfused as needed to keep Hct > 21 due to pancytopenia. There are no acute therapies planned for multiple myeloma. Diltiazem has been increased for hypertension and AFib.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition through tube feeds, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (boots with IV heparin), stress ulcer prevention, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient is discussed on interdisciplinary rounds and has a code status of full code. He will remain in the ICU for further management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with influenza, PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), and pneumococcal pneumonia. The patient has undergone several interventions including increased doses of diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control, dialysis, blood transfusion, and heparin infusion. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he remains on mechanical ventilation. Laboratory results show acute renal failure, anemia, leukopenia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's mental status has improved, but he still exhibits some confusion. The assessment includes respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, PJP, influenza, anemia, leukopenia, renal failure, demand ischemia, and multiple myeloma. The plan includes continuing current management, monitoring vital signs, and following up on specific recommendations for each condition. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and continued need for mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are crucial.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia, caused by influenza, PJP, and pneumococcus, may lead to further respiratory complications and sepsis. Antibiotic treatment should be continued, and the"

   -sats in low-mid 90's, not complaining of SOB or CP
   -on po methadone taper, last day today of 10mg
   #.  Altered Mental Status:  Good improvement, nearly resolved. Likely
   [**2-26**] to sedation and slow recovery from infection.  Head CT on [**3-10**]
   showed no actue bleed, however poor study for ischemic stroke.
   Persistent right lip droop less prominent,
   -CSF negative for HSV, d/c acyclovir
   -continue methadone taper as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a diagnosis of myeloma admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. The patient has been found to have influenza, PJP, and pneumococcus in his sputum. 

The patient's medical complications include pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, renal failure (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, pancytopenia (low blood cell counts), multiple myeloma (malignant neoplasm), and altered mental status.

The patient has received various treatments including antibiotics for the infections, dialysis for renal failure, anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 121-139 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/67 to 171/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7-22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on face tent, and temperature within normal range.

Laboratory results show abnormalities such as elevated creatinine levels, low hemoglobin and white blood cell count, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's nutritional support is being provided through enteral feeding at a rate of 20 mL/hour, and glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin sliding scale"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, who presented with influenza pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia, and PCP leading to respiratory failure and renal failure. He now has ongoing issues of delirium, atrial fibrillation (under reasonable control), and renal failure on hemodialysis. The patient is also experiencing pancytopenia, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has had pneumonia twice, indicating a weakened respiratory system. This could lead to further respiratory infections or failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is currently on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure. If not managed properly, this could progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require lifelong dialysis or kidney transplantation.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be closely monitored as it can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood cell counts make him more susceptible to infections and bleeding disorders.
5. Delirium: Although the patient's delirium is improving, it is still present, and further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate care.
6. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's underlying cancer may continue to progress and cause additional complications, such as bone fractures or anemia.

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma who presented with influenza pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia, and PCP leading to respiratory failure and renal failure. He currently has ongoing issues of delirium, atrial fibrillation (under reasonable control without infusions), and renal failure (on hemodialysis).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has already had two types of pneumonia (influenza and pneumococcal) which have led to respiratory failure. There is a risk of developing another type of pneumonia while in the ICU.
2. Renal failure: The patient is on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure. This indicates a possible long-term complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if the renal function does not improve.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation, which may require close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as stroke.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can lead to an increased risk of infections, anemia, and bleeding.
5. Delirium: Although the patient's delirium is improving, there is still a risk of further cognitive decline or development of other mental health issues during his stay in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myeloma who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with influenza, PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), and pneumococcal pneumonia. The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure but is improving. He also has altered mental status, which is resolving, possibly due to sedation and recovery from infection. The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments, and he has a history of atrial fibrillation. He is being treated for PJP, influenza, hypertension, anemia, leukopenia, renal failure, ischemic heart disease, and multiple myeloma. The patient had a central line associated bloodstream infection and is on dialysis. He is also receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's dysphagia has improved, and he is receiving tube feeds. The patient's condition is stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to use accessory muscles for breathing, indicating ongoing respiratory distress. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with multiple infections, including influenza, PJP, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Infections can worsen respiratory failure and lead to sepsis. Continued antibiotic therapy and infection control measures are important.

   1. Altered mental status
   Patient with increased confusion following pre-rounding today. Likely
   ICU delirium.  Consider medication effect
 e.g. prednisone. No fevers
   worrisome for new/progressive infection, studies recently negative
   including HSV PCR.  CT head on [**3-15**] without evidence of new stroke or
   hemorrhage. However, did show enlarged bifrontal fluid collections
   atrophy vs ?hygromas. In setting of other bleeding, need to rule out
   CNS hemorrhage therefore will repeat CT head today. Patient not
   cooperative with taking Zydis so will need to use prn haldol IV to
   control agitation for now. QTC will need monitoring on Haldol. Repeat
   blood cultures, check ABG and repeat vitals (patient refused O2 sat
   probe when initially assessed during rounds with team today).
   2. GI Bleeding
   Patient with heme+ stools earlier in admission, had not progresed. Now
   with small amount gross GI bleed [**Name8 (MD) **] RN with decreased Hct today.
   Is on steroids, dual antiplatelet therapy, and heparin so at clear
   elevated risk of bleeding.
   Of note, he had both EGD and colonoscopy in [**2124**] that were significant
   for mild gastritis and hiatal hernia on EGD and adenoma on colonoscopy.
   Type and screen active, would transfuse 1 unit PRBCs. Transfuse Hb<8
   and with active bleeding. Change PPI to IV BID. Stop heparin, aspirin,
   and plavix. Attempt to place 2 peripheral IVs. Consult GI regarding
   possible endoscopy.
   3. Hypoxia
   Stable, likely due to resolving pulmonary infections
 has had
   influenza, PJP, pneumococcus from sputum. Breathing comfortably on tent
   mask. s/p ceftriaxone for pneumococcus, oseltamivir for influenza B,
   and completing treatment for PJP.
   4. h/o PJP
   Initially treated with bactrim, discontinued due to concern that this
   was causing cytopenias (though unclear if sole culprit as patient had
   received cytoxan and was on beta lactams). Needs to complete 3 week
   course of steroids, primaquine, clindamycin initially scheduled to end
   [**3-24**]. Note that patient has missed doses of primaquine this week
   secondary to no oral access earlier in the week. In setting of present
   confusion not cooperative with PO medications. Need to replace NGT
   today
 else needs IV meds for PCP.
   5. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate control improved, on high dose PO diltiazem as well as metoprolol.
   Dialysis catheter was pulled back yesterday, had appeared to abut the
   RA, question whether this was causing atrial irritability leading to
   very difficult to control HR.
   6. ESRD
   Remains dialysis dependent, making little/no urine. Nephrology
   following, on sevelamer. Renal dose medications.
   7. CAD
   ST depressions on EKG in setting of RVR, cardiac enzymes flat. Likely
   demand ischemia. On beta blocker, antiplatelet agents on hold as above.
   8. Multiple myeloma
   s/p IVIG, oncology recommendations appreciated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who was admitted with respiratory distress and diagnosed with influenza, PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), and pneumococcus. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Altered mental status: The patient has increased confusion and is likely experiencing ICU delirium. Medication effects, such as prednisone, should be considered. There are no fevers or new/progressive infections, but a repeat CT head will be done due to enlarged bifrontal fluid collections.

2. GI bleeding: The patient had heme+ stools earlier and now has a small amount of gross GI bleed. He is at an elevated risk of bleeding due to being on steroids, dual antiplatelet therapy, and heparin. A type and screen have been ordered, and he will receive 1 unit PRBCs. His Hct has decreased. He will be changed to IV PPI and his heparin, aspirin, and plavix will be stopped. Consultation with GI regarding possible endoscopy has been requested.

   1. Altered mental status
   Patient with increased confusion following pre-rounding today. Likely
   ICU delirium.  Consider medication effect
 e.g. prednisone. No fevers
   worrisome for new/progressive infection, studies recently negative
   including HSV PCR.  CT head on [**3-15**] without evidence of new stroke or
   hemorrhage. However, did show enlarged bifrontal fluid collections
   atrophy vs ?hygromas. In setting of other bleeding, need to rule out
   CNS hemorrhage therefore will repeat CT head today. Patient not
   cooperative with taking Zydis so will need to use prn haldol IV to
   control agitation for now. QTC will need monitoring on Haldol. Repeat
   blood cultures, check ABG and repeat vitals (patient refused O2 sat
   probe when initially assessed during rounds with team today).
   2. GI Bleeding
   Patient with heme+ stools earlier in admission, had not progresed. Now
   with small amount gross GI bleed [**Name8 (MD) **] RN with decreased Hct today.
   Is on steroids, dual antiplatelet therapy, and heparin so at clear
   elevated risk of bleeding.
   Of note, he had both EGD and colonoscopy in [**2124**] that were significant
   for mild gastritis and hiatal hernia on EGD and adenoma on colonoscopy.
   Type and screen active, would transfuse 1 unit PRBCs. Transfuse Hb<8
   and with active bleeding. Change PPI to IV BID. Stop heparin, aspirin,
   and plavix. Attempt to place 2 peripheral IVs. Consult GI regarding
   possible endoscopy.
   3. Hypoxia
   Stable, likely due to resolving pulmonary infections
 has had
   influenza, PJP, pneumococcus from sputum. Breathing comfortably on tent
   mask. s/p ceftriaxone for pneumococcus, oseltamivir for influenza B,
   and completing treatment for PJP.
   4. h/o PJP
   Initially treated with bactrim, discontinued due to concern that this
   was causing cytopenias (though unclear if sole culprit as patient had
   received cytoxan and was on beta lactams). Needs to complete 3 week
   course of steroids, primaquine, clindamycin initially scheduled to end
   [**3-24**]. Note that patient has missed doses of primaquine this week
   secondary to no oral access earlier in the week. In setting of present
   confusion not cooperative with PO medications. Need to replace NGT
   today
 else needs IV meds for PCP.
   5. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate control improved, on high dose PO diltiazem as well as metoprolol.
   Dialysis catheter was pulled back yesterday, had appeared to abut the
   RA, question whether this was causing atrial irritability leading to
   very difficult to control HR.
   6. ESRD
   Remains dialysis dependent, making little/no urine. Nephrology
   following, on sevelamer. Renal dose medications.
   7. CAD
   ST depressions on EKG in setting of RVR, cardiac enzymes flat. Likely
   demand ischemia. On beta blocker, antiplatelet agents on hold as above.
   8. Multiple myeloma
   s/p IVIG, oncology recommendations appreciated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a diagnosis of myeloma who was admitted with respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza, PJP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), and pneumococcus in his sputum. 

The patient's 24-hour events include continued atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), dialysis catheter pulled back due to concern of irritating the right atrium, NGT (nasogastric tube) removed after passing speech and swallow evaluation, heme-positive stools without gross melena or hematochezia, dialysis administered, confusion and agitation, allergies to Flomax or orthostasis; Bactrim pancytopenia, last dose of antibiotics given, and other medications not being administered as prescribed.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 66-124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/61mmHg to 170/109mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 9-18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% on medium concentration mask, and sinus rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo gentleman with myeloma admitted with respiratory failure in the
   setting of multiple infections.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Hct stable after transfusion, but continues to have large amount of
   black stool in his rectal tube.
   -          continue to hold ASA, plavix, and heparin gtt
   -          follow TID Hct and transfuse for Hct < 21; active type and
   screen
   -          obtain better PIV access
   -          initial drop to 18 in setting of significant bleed from
   pulled peripheral IV [**3-19**]
   -          GI recs appreciated
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Head CT negative, infectious work-up negative.  Most likely from
   disorientation during acute illness in unfamiliar setting with language
   barrier.
   Much improved this morning, alert and cooperative.
   -          QTc 430 (got haldol yesterday)
   -          Monitor mental status today, orient with family present
   # Respiratory Distress:  In setting of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 134**], and pneumococal
   pneumonia.
   -          s/p treatment with tamiflu and ceftriaxone
   -          continue steroid, primaquine, and clindamycin for total 3
   weeks (last day [**3-24**])
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   on HD
   -          s/p HD [**3-19**]
   -          continue sevelamer
   -          appreciate renal recs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Improved rate control now that dialysis catheter pulled back.
   -          continue diltiazem and metoprolol PO
   -          no anticoagulation in setting of ongoing bleed
 PANCYTOPENIA
   felt secondary to Bactrim and possibly myeloma
   -          counts stable, monitor
   # CAD:
   Has had ST depressions in setting of rapid rate.  Cardiac enzymes
   negative (troponin not useful in setting of renal failure).
   -          likely demand ischemia, not coronary plaque
   -          on beta blocker
   -          holding ASA, plavix in setting of GI bleed
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   -          s/p IV Ig
   -          appreciate oncology input
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   -          continue diltiazem and metoprolol

","The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with myeloma admitted with respiratory failure in the setting of multiple infections. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, pancytopenia, coronary artery disease, multiple myeloma, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's history of melena and ongoing black stool in the rectal tube.
2. Infection-related complications due to the presence of multiple infections.
3. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal failure due to ongoing bleeding and potential hypoperfusion.
4. Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias due to coronary artery disease and rapid heart rate.
5. Respiratory distress or failure due to underlying pulmonary conditions like PCP and pneumococcal pneumonia.
6. Bleeding complications due to pancytopenia and use of anticoagulants.
7. Cardiovascular events such as stroke or transient ischemic attack due to atrial fibrillation.
8. Complications related to multiple myeloma such as bone fractures or infections.
9. Hypotensive episodes due to hypertension.
10. Malnutrition due to inadequate oral intake or nutritional support.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, pneumonia, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, pancytopenia, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and altered mental status. The patient presented with melena and lost a significant amount of blood, resulting in a low hematocrit (HCT) level of 18.1%. The patient was transfused with one unit of blood and underwent dialysis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 161/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, soft abdomen, and no edema in the lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet count (Plt), as well as elevated creatinine (Cr) and lactate levels. The patient's imaging shows no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or bleed. The patient's current medications include haloperidol, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. The patient's allergies include Flomax and Bactrim. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of flu and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis Jiroveci (PCP). He has a history of multiple medical conditions, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), pancytopenia, hypertension, benign, and multiple myeloma (cancer). The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, pancytopenia, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient continues to have melena, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This requires close monitoring and intervention with the gastrointestinal team.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by PCP and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be continued to treat these infections.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good rate control for atrial fibrillation. It is essential to monitor his heart rhythm and continue with appropriate medication.

5. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may be secondary to Bactrim and possibly myeloma. Further evaluation and management are needed.

6. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has multiple myeloma, which requires ongoing oncology follow-up"
