   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 35 year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, sleep
   apnea, and polyarticular arthritis who presented to the orthopedics
   service for TKR now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Hypoxia most likely is primarily a result of
   atelectasis and possibly some level of OSA/pulmonary HTN/COPD at
   baseline (given long smoking history).  Hypercapnia on the other hand
   probably primarily attributable to Pickwikian syndrome, OSA, and poor
   respiratory mechanics leading to tiring.  These second group of
   processes were almost certainly worsened by the supplementary narcotics
   depressing central respiratory drive.
   - Intubated due to agitation and severe confusion likely related to
   hypercarbia
   - Heparin gtt for now given small filling defect on prior CTA, touch
   base with radiology in AM
   - LENIs
   - Hemodynamic monitoring with arterial line
   - Minimize sedation
   - Though concern for aspiration on c-xray, will not treat for now as
   hemodynamically stable, no fever or WBC.  Low threshold to start abx if
   any change in above parameters.
   .
   # Hypotension: Transient hypotension in the setting of initiation of
   propofol.  Given 1 L fluid bolus and switched to versed/fentanyl.
   Cardiopulmonary processes less likely.
   - Central venous line, check CVPs to assess volume status as body
   habitus makes this difficult
   - Treat empirically for PE for now given above
   - IVF pending CVPs
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - A-line for closer monitoring
   .
   # Acute renal failure - DDx of renal failure includes pre-renal failure
   due to hypovolemia and fluid loss/blood loss. Also could be intrinisic
   renal insult such as ATN from intra-op relative hypotension or AIN from
   a drug reaction.  Responded to IVF overnight.
   - Check CVP once central line placed, IVF accordingly
   - Check urine sodium, creatinine, osmolality, and smear for urine
   eosinophils
   - Hold nephrotoxic meds including ACEI, NSAIDs
   .
   # Agitation: Likely related to hypercarbia and reflects hypercarbic
   encephalopathy.
   - Correct respiratory processes as above
   .
   # s/p ortho procedure - stable.
   - Ortho team following
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   .
   # Access: 18 g, 20 g, attempting central line
   .
   # PPx: heparin gtt
   .
   # Code:  presumed full

   # Dispo:  pending improvement

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, sleep apnea, and polyarticular arthritis who presented to the orthopedics service for total knee replacement (TKR) and was transferred to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory distress is most likely due to atelectasis, possibly some level of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at baseline. Hypercarbia is likely attributable to Pickwickian syndrome, OSA, and poor respiratory mechanics leading to tiring. These processes were worsened by supplementary narcotics depressing central respiratory drive.

The patient was intubated due to agitation and severe confusion likely related to hypercarbia. Heparin was started due to a small filling defect on prior computed tomography angiography (CTA), and further evaluation is needed. The patient has hypotension, which is transient and occurred during the initiation of propofol. A fluid bolus was given, and the patient was switched to versed/fentanyl. Cardiopulmonary causes are less likely.

The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal failure from hypovolemia and fluid loss/blood loss, or intrinsic renal insult such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from intraoperative hypotension or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) from a drug reaction. The patient responded to intravenous fluids"

","The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, sleep apnea, and polyarticular arthritis who presented to the orthopedics service for total knee replacement (TKR) and was subsequently transferred to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, agitation, and impaired physical mobility.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to atelectasis and possibly some level of OSA (obstructive sleep apnea), pulmonary hypertension, and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) at baseline. Hypercapnia may be primarily attributable to Pickwickian syndrome, OSA, and poor respiratory mechanics leading to tiring. These processes could worsen due to supplementary narcotics depressing central respiratory drive.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension during the initiation of propofol. This could be due to cardiopulmonary processes or volume depletion. The patient has been given a 1 L fluid bolus and switched to versed/fentanyl. Central venous line placement should be considered to assess volume status, especially given the patient's body habitus. Empirical treatment for pulmonary embolism (PE) should be initiated, and IV fluids should be managed accordingly.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The differential diagnosis of renal failure includes pre-renal failure due to hypov"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 35 year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, sleep
   apnea, and polyarticular arthritis who presented to the orthopedics
   service for TKR now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure: Hypoxia most likely is primarily a result of
   atelectasis and possibly some level of OSA/pulmonary HTN/COPD at
   baseline (given long smoking history).  Hypercapnia on the other hand
   probably primarily attributable to Pickwikian syndrome, OSA, and poor
   respiratory mechanics leading to tiring.  There is some concern for
   pulmonary embolism given demographics and unclear area on initial CTA,
   but [**Name (NI) **]
s negative for clot.
   - Heparin gtt for now given small filling defect on prior CTA,
   repeating today
   -If second CTA negative for filling defect will d/c heparin
   - Hemodynamic monitoring with arterial line
   - Minimize sedation
   -receiving treatment for possible aspiration pneumonia w/ vanc and
   pip-tazo
   -attempt SBT this PM
   # Hypotension: Transient hypotension in the setting of initiation of
   propofol.  Given 1 L fluid bolus and switched to versed/fentanyl.
   Cardiopulmonary processes less likely.
   - Central venous line, check CVPs to assess volume status as body
   habitus makes this difficult
   - IVF pending CVPs
   - Hold antihypertensives
   # Acute renal failure
 FeNa c/w prerenal etiology and Cr. Continues to
   improve.
   -hold IVF for now given concern for some volume overload
   - Hold nephrotoxic meds including ACEI, NSAIDs
   # Agitation: Patient requiring large doses of sedation due to attempts
   to displace lines/tubes and agitation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, sleep apnea, and polyarticular arthritis. He presented to the orthopedics service for total knee replacement (TKR) and was transferred to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia due to atelectasis and possibly underlying OSA, pulmonary hypertension, and COPD. Hypercapnia is likely a result of Pickwickian syndrome, OSA, and poor respiratory mechanics. There is also concern for pulmonary embolism, but initial CTA was negative. Heparin gtt has been started, and a repeat CTA will be performed.

2. Hypotension: The patient had transient hypotension during the initiation of propofol. A 1 L fluid bolus was given, and the sedation was switched to versed/fentanyl. Cardiopulmonary processes are less likely, and central venous line will be checked for CVPs to assess volume status.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a FeNa consistent with prerenal etiology. The creatinine level is improving, and IVF has been held due to concerns of volume overload. Nephrotoxic medications, including ACEI and NSAIDs, have also been held.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 35 year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, sleep
   apnea, and polyarticular arthritis who presented to the orthopedics
   service for TKR now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
    # Respiratory Failure: Still minimal suspicion for for primary
   pulmonary process as minimal pathology on chest CT.  Still think this
   was most likely a result of atelectasis and possibly some level of
   OSA/pulmonary HTN/COPD at baseline (given long smoking history).
   Hypercapnia on the other hand is probably primarily attributable to
   Pickwikian syndrome, OSA, and poor respiratory mechanics leading to
   tiring.  Given two negative (though non-ideal) CTA
s of the chest and
   significant improvement despite extubation we have stopped empiric
   therapy for PE.  No significant infiltrate on imaging, no increased
   sputum, and lack of specificity of GPC
s in respiratory culture
   suggests no pneumonia so will d/c antibiotics today.
   -minimize sedating meds (opioids or other therapies)
   -stop antibiotics

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, sleep apnea, and polyarticular arthritis. He presented to the orthopedics service for total knee replacement and was transferred to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been on invasive ventilation but was extubated in the afternoon and showed improvement. He had a fever and was started on antibiotics, but they were discontinued due to negative microbiology results. The patient's agitation improved, and he is expected to return to the floor today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could be due to atelectasis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These conditions may lead to recurrent respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient experienced acute renal failure, which could be attributed to prerenal causes. It is important to monitor fluid balance and ensure adequate renal perfusion to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension when propofol was stopped, but it has not recurred. Monitoring blood pressure and holding anti-hypertensive medications may be necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
4. Agitation: The patient's agitation improved after stopping scheduled haloperidol. Monitoring for any signs of agitation"

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, sleep apnea, and polyarticular arthritis. He presented to the orthopedics service for total knee replacement (TKR) and was transferred to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is most likely a result of atelectasis and possibly OSA, pulmonary hypertension, and COPD at baseline. There is concern for pulmonary embolism, but the patient tested negative for clot. He is receiving treatment for possible aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient experienced transient hypotension during the initiation of propofol and was given a fluid bolus and switched to versed/fentanyl. Cardiopulmonary processes are less likely. His acute renal failure is improving, and he has been holding IV fluids and nephrotoxic medications.

The patient requires large doses of sedation due to agitation and attempts to displace lines/tubes. He has erythema on his left leg, though the joint area itself does not appear swollen. The ortho team should be consulted regarding the need to tap. The patient's current status is as follows:
- Vital signs: Tmax 39.3°C, Tcurrent 36.3°C, HR 74 bpm, BP 165/70 mmHg, RR 24/min, SpO2 95%
