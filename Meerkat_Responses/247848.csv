   Assessment and Plan
   .
   Assessment and Plan:
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has history of fevers, cough productive of yellow
   sputum and increasing SOB consistent with PNA. Fever couple days ago,
   could have post-flu bacterial PNA. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative. Flu positive
   -Vanco, Zosyn, Levo
   -Sputum cx f/u
   -Cell counts on BAL fluid f/u
   -Treat with tamiflu
   -Consult ID about adding IV paramivir
   .
   # Respiratory failure: as above. Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs
   PNA. p/F<200 ARDS. Patient had BNP done at outside hospital which was
   normal, basically ruling out CHF. He is currently producing frothy
   sputum. Ventillation per ARDS net protocol.  If patient continues to
   require increased PEEP, will consider Esophageal balloon to further
   assess.  Patient put on propofol drip because overbreathing the vent.
   Still overbreathing the vent but improving ABG
   -paralysis with Cisatracurium Besylate 0.06-0.30 mg/kg/hr IV TITRATE TO
   paralysis
   -Esophageal balloon this morning
   -Repeat CXR this morning to check tube position
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient appears to be presenting with sepsis with
   tachycardia, elevated RR and elevated WBC count. [**Month (only) 8**] have hypotension
   secondary to end-organ hypoperfusion. Given setting of sepsis, started
   on levophed.
   -Will give fluids to volume rescusitate in attempt to get off of
   pressors
   -Give 150 mEq of NaBicarb in 1000 mL D5W (500cc)
   -If following volume rescusitation ineffective will give 500 cc bolus
   of LR.
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some
   improvement. Also notes that he was having diarrhea, unclear duration.
   CT abdomen to assess. Stool sent for C. diff. Also LFT
s were elevated
   -Recheck LFT
s today
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb. Per family
   has had several days of diarrhea so most likely had true losses of
   bicarb, likely cause of acidosis. Gave 150 mEq of NaBicarb in 1000 mL
   D5W (500cc)
   -Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis in
   setting of diarrhea
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia, responding well
   to fluids (increased from 120 at OSH--> 126 here)  This morning is 137.
   -Continue to monitor, volume repletion as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Verified with PCP
   .
   #DM II: Insulin s/s as patient currently NPO
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, start tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; pneumoboots
   Access: peripherals, Aline, IJ Central line
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Father and mother
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.
- He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A.
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.
- He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, paralysis with cisatracurium, and norepinephrine for hypotension.
- The patient also has hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, and potential kidney dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe pneumonia and ARDS, leading to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation is necessary. Esophageal balloon may be considered to further assess lung compliance.

2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and hypotension suggest sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and organ function is crucial. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics is essential.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fevers, cough productive of yellow sputum, and increasing shortness of breath, are consistent with pneumonia. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative, and flu positive"

   tachycardia, elevated RR and elevated WBC count. [**Month (only) 8**] have hypotension
   secondary to end-organ hypoperfusion. Given setting of sepsis, started
   on levophed.
   -Will give fluids to volume rescusitate in attempt to get off of
   pressors
   -Give 150 mEq of NaBicarb in 1000 mL D5W (500cc)
   -If following volume rescusitation ineffective will give 500 cc bolus
   of LR.
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some
   improvement. Also notes that he was having diarrhea, unclear duration.
   CT abdomen to assess. Stool sent for C. diff. Also given ? jaundice
   will send LFTs.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb. Per family
   has had several days of diarrhea so most likely had true losses of
   bicarb, likely cause of acidosis. Gave 150 mEq of NaBicarb in 1000 mL
   D5W (500cc)
   -Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia, responding well
   to fluids (increased from 120 at OSH--> 126 here)
   -Continue to monitor, volume repletion as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg
   daily; will need to verify medications in the morning.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin s/s as patient currently NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with Down syndrome and a complex medical history. He presented with influenza and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has progressed to possible bacterial pneumonia and shock. The patient is critically ill and requires continuous monitoring and intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS has led to severe respiratory compromise, requiring mechanical ventilation. The presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggests ongoing pulmonary inflammation and potential worsening of respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's immune compromised state due to Down syndrome and the presence of bacterial pneumonia, there is a high risk of developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is crucial.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake-output discrepancy, indicating the possibility of fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function. This could be related to hypotension, sepsis, or direct involvement of the kidneys due to ARDS.
5. Delirium or Cognitive Impairment: The patient is pharmacologically paralyzed, which may contribute to an altered mental status or delirium. Monitoring for changes in cognition and mental function is essential.
6. Venous Thromboembolism: Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of deep vein throm"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with Down syndrome and a complex medical history. He is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of influenza and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient is critically ill and requires life support measures.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including resistant organisms, due to his history of MRSA. He is also being treated for influenza while awaiting DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) results. The patient is on ARDSnet ventilation and has been given paralysis to assist with breathing.

His vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 75/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.5 K/uL, elevated platelet count of 316 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L. Blood cultures have been obtained, and additional tests are pending.

Imaging shows bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's acid-base status shows non-gap acidosis, which may be due to diarrhea. Sodium bicarbonate has been given to correct the acidosis.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further interventions may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with Down syndrome and a complex medical history. He presents with symptoms of influenza and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including antibiotics, antivirals, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his respiratory status remains critical. He has a history of shock, possible bacterial pneumonia, and is now suspected to have a secondary bacterial superinfection. Imaging shows bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: Given the patient's ARDS and need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of worsening respiratory function and potential respiratory failure.
2. Secondary bacterial infection: The presence of bilateral infiltrates and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible bacterial superinfection. This could lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly.
3. Shock: The patient has a history of shock, which may be related to his influenza infection or underlying comorbidities. Continued monitoring and management are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
4. Complications from invasive procedures: As the patient is critically ill and intubated, he is at risk for complications associated with mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotra"

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has history of fevers, cough productive of yellow
   sputum and increasing SOB consistent with PNA. Fever couple days ago,
   could have post-flu bacterial PNA. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative. Flu positive

   -Sputum cx f/u
   -Cell counts on BAL fluid f/u
   -Treat with tamiflu
   -Consult ID about adding IV paramivir
   .
   # Respiratory failure: as above. Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs
   PNA. p/F<200 ARDS. Patient had BNP done at outside hospital which was
   normal, basically ruling out CHF. He is currently producing frothy
   sputum. Ventillation per ARDS net protocol.  If patient continues to
   require increased PEEP, will consider Esophageal balloon to further
   assess.  Patient put on propofol drip because overbreathing the vent.
   Still overbreathing the vent but improving ABG
   -paralysis with Cisatracurium Besylate 0.06-0.30 mg/kg/hr IV TITRATE TO
   paralysis
   -Esophageal balloon this morning
   -Repeat CXR this morning to check tube position
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient appears to be presenting with sepsis with
   tachycardia, elevated RR and elevated WBC count. [**Month (only) 8**] have hypotension
   secondary to end-organ hypoperfusion. Given setting of sepsis, started
   on levophed.
   -Will give fluids to volume rescusitate in attempt to get off of
   pressors
   -Give 150 mEq of NaBicarb in 1000 mL D5W (500cc)
   -If following volume rescusitation ineffective will give 500 cc bolus
   of LR.
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some
   improvement. Also notes that he was having diarrhea, unclear duration.
   CT abdomen to assess. Stool sent for C. diff. Also LFT
s were elevated
   -Recheck LFT
s today
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb. Per family
   has had several days of diarrhea so most likely had true losses of
   bicarb, likely cause of acidosis. Gave 150 mEq of NaBicarb in 1000 mL
   D5W (500cc)
   -Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis in
   setting of diarrhea
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia, responding well
   to fluids (increased from 120 at OSH--> 126 here)  This morning is 137.
   -Continue to monitor, volume repletion as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Verified with PCP
   .
   #DM II: Insulin s/s as patient currently NPO
   .
   #GERD: PPI

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A. 

Key findings from the progress note include:

1. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, likely secondary to ARDS. The PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio is less than 200, indicating severe ARDS.

2. He has frothy sputum production, which suggests pulmonary edema, a common feature of ARDS.

3. The patient's blood pressure is low, and he has been started on vasopressor support (Levophed) due to suspected sepsis. He also has tachycardia and an elevated white blood cell count, which are consistent with sepsis.

4. The patient has hypotension that is not responsive to fluid resuscitation alone. Further fluid resuscitation and consideration of additional pressor support may be necessary.

5. The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which could be contributing to metabolic acidosis. He received sodium bicarbonate supplementation to correct the acidosis.

6. The patient's sodium levels are low, likely due to hypovolemic hyponatremia. Fluid resuscitation has helped improve his sodium levels.

7. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus type II. His medications"

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has history of fevers, cough productive of yellow
   sputum and increasing SOB consistent with PNA. Fever couple days ago,
   could have post-flu bacterial PNA. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative. Flu positive
   -Vanco, Zosyn, Levo
   -Sputum cx f/u
   -Cell counts on BAL fluid f/u
   -Treat with tamiflu
   -Add IV paramivir
   .
   # Respiratory failure: as above. Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs
   PNA. p/F<200 ARDS. Patient had BNP done at outside hospital which was
   normal, basically ruling out CHF. He is currently producing frothy
   sputum. Ventillation per ARDS net protocol.  If patient continues to
   require increased PEEP, will consider Esophageal balloon to further
   assess.  Patient put on propofol drip because overbreathing the vent.
   Still overbreathing the vent but improving ABG
   -paralysis with Cisatracurium Besylate 0.06-0.30 mg/kg/hr IV TITRATE TO
   paralysis
   -Esophageal balloon this morning
   -Daily CXR
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient appears to be presenting with sepsis with
   tachycardia, elevated RR and elevated WBC count. [**Month (only) 8**] have hypotension
   secondary to end-organ hypoperfusion. Given setting of sepsis, started
   on levophed.
   -Will hold off on fluids because seems to be adequately hydrated and
   too many fluids will not help resp situation
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some
   improvement. Also notes that he was having diarrhea, unclear duration.
   CT abdomen to assess. Stool sent for C. diff. Also LFT
s were
   elevated.  Yesterday had normalized.  Likely ischemic injury from
   illness.
   -Recheck LFT
s q4d
   - Will give bowel regimen and see if improves distention
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb. Per family
   has had several days of diarrhea so most likely had true losses of
   bicarb, likely cause of acidosis. Gave 150 mEq of NaBicarb in 1000 mL
   D5W (500cc)
   - Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis
   in setting of diarrhea
   - Repeat ABG
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia, responding well
   to fluids (increased from 120 at OSH--> 126 here)  This morning is 134.
   - Leave for now and reassess tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Verified with PCP
   .
   #DM II: Insulin s/s as patient currently NPO
   .
   #GERD: PPI

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension presenting with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications.

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is consistent with symptoms such as fevers, productive cough, and increasing shortness of breath. The chest CT shows severe pneumonia but no abscesses or effusions. Legionella antigen test was negative, and the patient tested positive for influenza A. The treatment plan includes antibiotics (Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levofloxacin), sputum culture follow-up, cell counts on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid follow-up, and antiviral treatment with Tamiflu and IV paramyxovirus.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS or sepsis versus pneumonia. The patient's pulmonary function (p/F ratio) is less than 200, indicating ARDS. A B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) test was done at the outside hospital, which was normal, ruling out congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is producing frothy sputum and is being ventilated according to ARDS network protocol. If the patient continues to require increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), an esophageal balloon will be"

   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has history of fevers, cough productive of yellow
   sputum and increasing SOB consistent with PNA. Fever couple days ago,
   could have post-flu bacterial PNA. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative. Flu positive
   -Vanco, Zosyn, Levo
   -Sputum cx f/u
   -Cell counts on BAL fluid f/u
   -Treat with tamiflu
   -Add IV paramivir
   .
   # Respiratory failure: as above. Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs
   PNA. p/F<200 ARDS. Patient had BNP done at outside hospital which was
   normal, basically ruling out CHF. He is currently producing frothy
   sputum. Ventillation per ARDS net protocol.  If patient continues to
   require increased PEEP, will consider Esophageal balloon to further
   assess.  Patient put on propofol drip because overbreathing the vent.
   Still overbreathing the vent but improving ABG
   -paralysis with Cisatracurium Besylate 0.06-0.30 mg/kg/hr IV TITRATE TO

   -Esophageal balloon this morning
   -Daily CXR
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient appears to be presenting with sepsis with
   tachycardia, elevated RR and elevated WBC count. [**Month (only) 8**] have hypotension
   secondary to end-organ hypoperfusion. Given setting of sepsis, started
   on levophed.
   -Will hold off on fluids because seems to be adequately hydrated and
   too many fluids will not help resp situation
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some
   improvement. Also notes that he was having diarrhea, unclear duration.
   CT abdomen to assess. Stool sent for C. diff. Also LFT
s were
   elevated.  Yesterday had normalized.  Likely ischemic injury from
   illness.
   -Recheck LFT
s q4d
   - Will give bowel regimen and see if improves distention
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb. Per family
   has had several days of diarrhea so most likely had true losses of
   bicarb, likely cause of acidosis. Gave 150 mEq of NaBicarb in 1000 mL
   D5W (500cc)
   - Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis
   in setting of diarrhea
   - Repeat ABG
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia, responding well
   to fluids (increased from 120 at OSH--> 126 here)  This morning is 134.
   - Leave for now and reassess tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Verified with PCP
   .
   #DM II: Insulin s/s as patient currently NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.
- He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hyperglycemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and airway inability to protect.
- He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing hypotension, which is being treated with levophed.
- He also has abdominal pain, likely ischemic injury from illness, and diarrhea.
- His laboratory results show elevated WBC count, high glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- Imaging studies reveal bilateral opacities in the chest X-ray, consistent with ARDS.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum cultures will be important for early detection and management.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and risk factors such as sepsis increase the risk of DVT/PE. Prophylactic measures such as pneumatic compression devices and subcutaneous he"

   lasix at 7pm.
   - was desaturating when put onto right side.  Repeat CXR was slightly
   worse vs. poor inspiration.  Patient stabilized when on left side.
   - father gave verbal consent for peramivir.  Started on peramivir 600mg
   daily and oseltamivir stopped.
   - patient ET tube leaking at 8pm.  High PEEPs seemed to be pushing the
   tube up.  Initially tried to push down a couple of centimeters and
   repeated CXR -> tube very high up, almost to larynx.  Tried to push
   down again, but kinked in mouth, temporarily not ventilated.  Then tube
   passed well.  Repeat CXR --> ET tube still up 10cm.  Finally anesthesia
   was called.  Pulled tube and balloon was above the chords.  Emergently

   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative. Flu positive
   -Continue Vanco, Zosyn and Azithromycin, today day 4.
   -Sputum stain negative, but f/u cx
   - Plan is now to stop tamiflu and start IV peramivir for 5 days, for
   total 10 days of neuraminidase inhibitor.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: as above. Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs
   PNA. p/F<200 ARDS. Patient had BNP done at outside hospital which was
   normal, making CHF less likely. Ventillation per ARDS net protocol with
   PEEP adjusted by esophageal balloon to allow for optimal intrathoracic
   pressures.  Has now had two days of cisatracurium b/c he was
   overbreathing vent.
   -d/c Cisatracurium Besylate today and monitor breathing pattern.  If he
   is uncomfortable or dysynchronus, restart paralysis.
   -Daily CXR
   -Esophageal balloon remains in place.
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: His abdomen is increasingly distended and limiting his
   respirations.  Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain for
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some improvement
   and some diarrhea prior to admission. CT abdomen [**12-7**] did not show any
   obstruction and C. diff is negative.  LFT
s were elevated but then
   normalized.
   - Check abdominal portable film as distension has been worsening.
   - Recheck LFT
s every few days.  We can recheck tomorrow morning.
   - If plain film not worrying, consider passing rectal tube to
   decompress.
   - Will give bowel regimen once he is no longer paralyzed.
   .
   # Hypotension: Though patient remains slightly hypotense, pressures are
   stable off of pressors at this point.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb.  Patient
   seems to have chronically elevated CO2 which may be contributing with a
   respiratory acidosis.
   - Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis
   in setting of diarrhea
   - Serial ABG
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia caused by influenza A. The patient was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and possible bacterial superinfection. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient also has hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, hypotension, acidosis, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus type II. He is being treated with multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and medications for his other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should closely monitor his respiratory status and perform daily chest X-rays to detect any signs of pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. The patient is at risk for DVT, and preventive measures such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin should be continued.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. The patient should receive stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent this complication.
4. Nosocomial infections: Being in the ICU, the"

   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative. Flu positive
   -Continue Vanco ([**6-5**]), Zosyn ([**6-5**]) and Azithromycin ([**6-2**]).
   -Sputum stain negative, but f/u cx
   - Plan is now to stop tamiflu and start IV peramivir for 5 days, for
   total 10 days of neuraminidase inhibitor.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   -Day [**3-5**] of peramivir
   .
   # Respiratory failure: as above. Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs
   PNA. p/F<200 ARDS. Patient had BNP done at outside hospital which was
   normal, making CHF less likely. Ventillation per ARDS net protocol with
   PEEP adjusted by esophageal balloon to allow for optimal intrathoracic
   pressures.
   -Daily CXR
   -Esophageal balloon remains in place
   -Will wean PEEP as possible
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: His abdomen is increasingly distended and limiting his
   respirations.  Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain for
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some improvement
   and some diarrhea prior to admission. CT abdomen [**12-7**] did not show any
   obstruction and C. diff is negative.  LFT
s were elevated but then
   normalized.  Now trending up slightly, small bump so will trend
   tomorrow
   -LFTs tomorrow
   -Rectal tube to decompress
   - Bowel regimen .
   #Hyponatremia: Patient edematous on exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] have renal failure in
   the setting of acute illness, but given that he is in ADRS will not
   give fluids.
   -Urine osm, urine electrolytes to further assess
   -monitor PM electrolytes
   #Renal failure: Patient has had slowly rising BUN and creatinine. [**Month (only) 8**]
   be ATN in setting of acute illness. Also could be related to peramavir,
   will check urine eosinophils to assess for this. Weaning of PEEP may
   improve hypotension and allow for greater blood flow to kidneys
   improving renal failure.
   -Check urine osm, urine electrolytes
   -D/c lasix.
   -Check and renally dose all medications
   -Urine eosinophils
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient on pressors. Hypotension may be related to
   propofol.
   -Stop propofol, will restart fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb.  Patient
   seems to have chronically elevated CO2 which may be contributing with a
   respiratory acidosis.
   - Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis
   in setting of diarrhea
   - Serial ABG
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient has been experiencing difficulty with bowel movements, as indicated by the need for a rectal tube and the presence of abdominal distension. This could be due to a combination of factors including immobility, medications, and underlying conditions.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated on multiple occasions, indicating possible poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. This could be exacerbated by the stress of illness and the inability to take oral medications.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 200, which suggests severe ARDS. This condition is often associated with pneumonia and can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

4. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest an infection, possibly secondary to influenza or bacterial superinfection. Sepsis can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.

5. Pneumonia: The patient's chest CT shows severe pneumonia, and there is evidence of a possible bacterial superinfection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy needs to be continued to treat the underlying infection.

6. Airway Inability to Protect: Due to the patient's altered mental status and reduced gag reflex, there is a risk of aspiration. Close monitoring and appropriate"

   normal, making CHF less likely. Ventillation per ARDS net protocol with
   PEEP adjusted by esophageal balloon to allow for optimal intrathoracic
   pressures.
   -Daily CXR
   -Esophageal balloon remains in place.

   #Abdominal Pain: His abdomen is increasingly distended and limiting his
   respirations.  Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain for
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some improvement
   and some diarrhea prior to admission. CT abdomen [**12-7**] did not show any
   obstruction and C. diff is negative.  LFT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and pneumonia caused by influenza A, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative, and flu positive. Treatment includes continuing Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Azithromycin.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS/sepsis or pneumonia. The patient's P/F ratio is <200, indicating severe ARDS. Ventilation is being managed per ARDS net protocol with PEEP adjusted by esophageal balloon to allow for optimal intrathoracic pressures.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdomen is increasingly distended and limiting his respirations. He has been experiencing abdominal pain for 1-2 days, which was initially treated with a heating pad. CT abdomen did not show any obstruction, and Clostridium difficile is negative. LFTs were elevated but then normalized, and now trending up slightly. A rectal tube will be placed to decompress the abdomen, and a bowel regimen will be given once the patient is no longer paralyzed.

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative. Flu positive
   -Continue Vanco ([**6-5**]), Zosyn ([**6-5**]) and Azithromycin ([**6-2**]).
   -Sputum stain negative, but f/u cx
   - Plan is now to stop tamiflu and start IV peramivir for 5 days, for
   total 10 days of neuraminidase inhibitor.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   -Day [**3-5**] of peramivir
   .
   # Respiratory failure: as above. Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs
   PNA. p/F<200 ARDS. Patient had BNP done at outside hospital which was
   normal, making CHF less likely. Ventillation per ARDS net protocol with
   PEEP adjusted by esophageal balloon to allow for optimal intrathoracic
   pressures.
   -Daily CXR
   -Esophageal balloon remains in place
   -Will wean PEEP as possible
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: His abdomen is increasingly distended and limiting his
   respirations.  Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain for
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some improvement
   and some diarrhea prior to admission. CT abdomen [**12-7**] did not show any
   obstruction and C. diff is negative.  LFT
s were elevated but then
   normalized.  Now trending up slightly, small bump so will trend
   tomorrow
   -LFTs tomorrow
   -Rectal tube to decompress
   - Bowel regimen .
   #Hyponatremia: Patient edematous on exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] have renal failure in
   the setting of acute illness, but given that he is in ADRS will not
   give fluids.
   -Urine osm, urine electrolytes to further assess
   -monitor PM electrolytes
   #Renal failure: Patient has had slowly rising BUN and creatinine. [**Month (only) 8**]
   be ATN in setting of acute illness. Also could be related to peramavir,
   will check urine eosinophils to assess for this. Weaning of PEEP may
   improve hypotension and allow for greater blood flow to kidneys
   improving renal failure.
   -Check urine osm, urine electrolytes
   -D/c lasix.
   -Check and renally dose all medications
   -Urine eosinophils
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient on pressors. Hypotension may be related to
   propofol.
   -Stop propofol, will restart fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb.  Patient
   seems to have chronically elevated CO2 which may be contributing with a
   respiratory acidosis.
   - Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis
   in setting of diarrhea
   - Serial ABG
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin s/s as patient currently NPO
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes,  restart tube feeds cautiously

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia due to influenza A, which has progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and risk for aspiration.

The patient's current medical conditions include constipation, hyperglycemia, ARDS, sepsis, pneumonia, inability to protect airway, renal failure, hypotension, acidosis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type II, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 84/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and a central venous pressure of 13 mmHg. The patient is receiving several medications including fentanyl, norepinephrine, propofol, famotidine, heparin sodium, and others.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, glucose levels, lactic acid, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal no evidence of small or large bowel obstruction and no gross free air, but are limited in evaluating for pneumoperitoneum.

The plan includes continuing antiviral therapy with IV peramivir for a total"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension presenting with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient has been experiencing difficulty with bowel movements, which can lead to constipation or obstipation. Measures such as rectal tube placement and bowel regimen may be necessary.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated on multiple occasions, indicating hyperglycemia. This may be due to stress, infection, or inadequate insulin management, especially since the patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth).

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has severe pneumonia and ARDS, which is a serious condition characterized by low oxygen levels in the blood and difficulty breathing. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and following ARDS network protocol.

4. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient initially presented with sepsis, likely secondary to influenza A infection. Antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential bacterial superinfections.

5. Pneumonia, Other: The patient has a severe pneumonia, possibly due to bacterial superinfection. Legionella antigen was negative, but further follow-up cultures are planned.

6. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient has an altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance, increasing the risk of"

          [**Year (4 digits) 1531**]
          Acute renal failure
          Hyponatremia
   We will continue peramivir and follow exam, EKG, and labs.  In
   particular, will follow hyponatremia.
   For [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] try to convert propofol to BZD.  Avoid fluid challenge
   given severe hypoxemic ARDS.
   For ARF, renally adjust meds including peramivir.  Check lytes, UA, and
   urine eos.
   Continue antibiotics for 8 day course.  D/C azithro after today.
   Will wean FiO2 to 0.5.  If able, decrease PEEP by 2 today.

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Seen several times throughout they day.  Tolerated wean of FiO2 to 0.5,
   so decreased PEEP to 16 and tolerating.  Successful transition of
   propofol to midazolam.  Subsequently, able to discontinue levophed.
   Oliguria, however, persists at ~20cc/hour.  Challenging situation given
   severe hypoxemic ARDS, CVP 18, etc.  However, since we have made

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of influenza (novel H1N1), ARDS (severe hypoxemic respiratory failure), acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. The patient has been receiving peramivir for the influenza, antibiotics for a suspected bacterial infection, and supportive care for ARDS. The patient's condition has been monitored closely with frequent assessments of vital signs, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's severe hypoxemic respiratory failure indicates a high risk for further respiratory complications. These may include worsening oxygenation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and barotrauma from mechanical ventilation.
2. Renal Complications: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status should be closely monitored due to the potential for cardiac complications, such as myocarditis or cardiac arrhythmias, which can occur secondary to viral infections.
4. Infectious Complications: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a concern for secondary infections. There is a risk of developing antibiotic-associated complications or resistant organisms.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and limited neurological"

   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative. Flu positive
   -Continue Vanco ([**7-6**]), Zosyn ([**7-6**]) and Azithromycin ([**6-2**]).
   -Sputum stain negative, but f/u cx
   - Plan is now to stop tamiflu and start IV peramivir for 5 days, for
   total 10 days of neuraminidase inhibitor.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   -Day [**4-2**] of peramivir
   .
   # Respiratory failure: as above. Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs
   PNA. p/F<200 ARDS. Patient had BNP done at outside hospital which was
   normal, making CHF less likely. Ventillation per ARDS net protocol with
   PEEP adjusted by esophageal balloon to allow for optimal intrathoracic
   pressures.
   -Daily CXR
   -Esophageal balloon remains in place
   -Will wean PEEP as possible
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: His abdomen is increasingly distended and limiting his
   respirations.  Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain for
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some improvement
   and some diarrhea prior to admission. CT abdomen [**12-7**] did not show any
   obstruction and C. diff is negative.  LFT
s were elevated but then
   normalized.  Now trending up slightly, small bump so will trend
   tomorrow
   -LFTs tomorrow
   -Rectal tube to decompress
   - Bowel regimen .
   #Hyponatremia: Patient edematous on exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] have renal failure in
   the setting of acute illness, but given that he is in ADRS will not
   give fluids.
   -Urine osm, urine electrolytes to further assess
   -monitor PM electrolytes
   #Renal failure: Patient has had slowly rising BUN and creatinine. [**Month (only) 8**]
   be ATN in setting of acute illness. Also could be related to peramavir,
   will check urine eosinophils to assess for this. Weaning of PEEP may
   improve hypotension and allow for greater blood flow to kidneys
   improving renal failure.
   -Check urine osm, urine electrolytes
   -D/c lasix.
   -Check and renally dose all medications
   -Urine eosinophils
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient on pressors. Hypotension may be related to
   propofol.
   -Stop propofol, will restart fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb.  Patient
   seems to have chronically elevated CO2 which may be contributing with a
   respiratory acidosis.
   - Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis
   in setting of diarrhea
   - Serial ABG
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Pneumonia: The patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but no abscesses or effusions. Legionella Ag negative. Flu positive. The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotics, but monitoring for any worsening of symptoms or development of new ones is necessary.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's most likely etiology is ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F < 200 ARDS. The patient had a BNP done at an outside hospital, which was normal, making CHF less likely. Ventilation per ARDS net protocol with PEEP adjusted by esophageal balloon to allow for optimal intrathoracic pressures. Daily CXR and weaning of PEEP as possible should be considered.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient has an increasingly distended abdomen and limited respirations. A CT abdomen did not show any obstruction, and C. diff is negative. LFTs were elevated but then normalized. Now trending up slightly, small bump so will trend tomorrow. A rectal tube to decompress, LFTs tomorrow, bowel regimen, and further evaluation for the cause of abdominal"

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Rash: He has a new macular-papular rash over his trunk, thighs and
   left arm.  Main differential is drug rash vs viral exanthema.  It seems
   unlikely that he would have a second viral infection and he is on
   several drugs that could potentially cause this exanthem.  The most
   likely cause at this point is the Zosyn, so we will switch to
   Ciprofloxacin for gram negative coverage.  We will continue peramivir
   for this time, but could stop it early if the rash worsens.
   - Switch Zosyn to cipro.  Continue Vanco and Peramivir.
   - Check LFTs and CBC w/ diff for possible DRESS.
   - No steroids at this time.
   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Flu positive, sputum cultures all negative.
   -Continue Vanco ([**8-5**]).  Because of rash switched to cipro for last two
   days.  Completed 5 days azithromycin.
   -Sputum cultures negative
   - Day [**4-2**] of peramivir.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200
   ARDS. Patient very desynchronous with the vent this morning despite
   very high levels of sedation.  We will re-paralyze for now with plan to
   re-evaluate on a daily basis as his respiratory status improves.
   - Restart cisatracuronium w/ bolus, then basal dose.
   - Daily CXR
   -Will wean PEEP as possible
   .
   #Renal failure: Patient has had decreasing urine output and increasing
   creatinine.  Fear ATN despite FENa yesterday of 0.2% suggesting
   primarily prerenal etiology.  Urine eos negative, making AIN less
   likely, though still possible.
   - consult renal
   - consider echo to evaluate cause of poor forward flow despite being
   many liters positive.
   - Re-check urine osm, urine electrolytes
   -D/c lasix for now.
   -Check and renally dose all medications
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: His abdomen has been persistently distended, though
   now he is stooling.  Per patient's father, patient having abdominal
   pain for 1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some
   improvement and some diarrhea prior to admission. CT abdomen [**12-7**] did
   not show any obstruction and C. diff is negative.  LFT
s show only a

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is severe influenza/ARDS and now oliguria. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has received various treatments and interventions. 

From the progress note, we can summarize the following medical complications that can arise:

1. Rash: The patient has developed a macular-papular rash over his trunk, thighs, and left arm. The differential diagnosis includes drug rash versus viral exanthema. The most likely cause seems to be Zosyn, so it has been switched to ciprofloxacin.

2. Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but no abscesses or effusions. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, peramivir, and ciprofloxacin.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS. The patient is very desynchronous with the ventilator, so it has been decided to re-paralyze him with cisatracuronium.

4. Renal failure: The patient has decreasing urine output and increasing creatinine levels, indicating renal failure. The possible causes include acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN). Renal consultation has been sought, and further tests are needed to evaluate the cause of renal failure.

5. Abdominal pain: The patient has persistent abdominal distention"

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Rash: He has a new macular-papular rash over his trunk, thighs and
   left arm.  Main differential is drug rash vs viral exanthema.  It seems
   unlikely that he would have a second viral infection and he is on
   several drugs that could potentially cause this exanthem.  The most
   likely cause at this point is the Zosyn, so we will switch to
   Ciprofloxacin for gram negative coverage.  We will continue peramivir
   for this time, but could stop it early if the rash worsens.
   - Switch Zosyn to cipro.  Continue Vanco and Peramivir.
   - Check LFTs and CBC w/ diff for possible DRESS.
   - No steroids at this time.
   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Flu positive, sputum cultures all negative.
   -Continue Vanco ([**8-5**]).  Because of rash switched to cipro for last two
   days.  Completed 5 days azithromycin.
   -Sputum cultures negative
   - Day [**4-2**] of peramivir.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200
   ARDS. Patient very desynchronous with the vent this morning despite
   very high levels of sedation.  We will re-paralyze for now with plan to
   re-evaluate on a daily basis as his respiratory status improves.
   - Restart cisatracuronium w/ bolus, then basal dose.
   - Daily CXR
   -Will wean PEEP as possible
   .
   #Renal failure: Patient has had decreasing urine output and increasing
   creatinine.  Fear ATN despite FENa yesterday of 0.2% suggesting
   primarily prerenal etiology.  Urine eos negative, making AIN less
   likely, though still possible.
   - consult renal
   - consider echo to evaluate cause of poor forward flow despite being
   many liters positive.
   - Re-check urine osm, urine electrolytes
   -D/c lasix for now.
   -Check and renally dose all medications
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: His abdomen is increasingly distended and limiting his
   respirations.  Per patient's father, patient having abdominal pain for
   1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some improvement
   and some diarrhea prior to admission. CT abdomen [**12-7**] did not show any
   obstruction and C. diff is negative.  LFT
s were elevated but then
   normalized.  Now trending up slightly, small bump so will trend
   tomorrow
   -LFTs tomorrow
   -Rectal tube to decompress
   - Bowel regimen .
   #Hyponatremia: Patient edematous on exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] have renal failure in
   the setting of acute illness, but given that he is in ADRS will not
   give fluids.
   -Urine osm, urine electrolytes to further assess
   -monitor PM electrolytes
   # Hypotension: Patient on pressors. Hypotension may be related to
   propofol.
   -Stop propofol, will restart fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, decreased bicarb.  Patient
   seems to have chronically elevated CO2 which may be contributing with a
   respiratory acidosis.
   - Continue to bolus with bicarb if continues to have non-gap acidosis
   in setting of diarrhea
   - Serial ABG
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

The patient has developed several complications including a macular-papular rash over his trunk, thighs, and left arm, likely due to Zosyn. There is also evidence of renal failure, with decreasing urine output and increasing creatinine levels.

   - Cr elevated yesterday am and UOP dropping off around 3am, gave
   another 500cc NS bolus
   - Pt very desynchronous with vent and taking tidal volumes up to
   500ccs.  Decided to re-paralyze for now to keep tidal volumes low,
   prevent lung injury.
   - Spoke with parents.  Told them ARDS recovery can be long and slow.
   That at some point we may need to talk to them about tracheostomy and
   PEG tube placement.  That we were consulting renal.
   - Renal: urine sediment w/ brown and fine granular casts, no dysmorphic
   RBCs.  Recommend: wean antibiotics as possible, repeat urine lytes,
   Ueos, CBC w/ diff, do echo.  Expect Cr to rise before improving, no
   need for urgent HD.
   - Paralysis didn't happen until around 6pm -> next gas had higher pCO2
   and improved pO2. Went up on tidal volume to 300, improved pCO2 so no
   further changes.
   - w/ paralysis had tachycardia and decreased UOP. Gave 500cc bolus w/

   # Respiratory failure: Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200
   ARDS. Patient re-paralyzed yesterday to allow for lower tidal volumes.
   His gas this morning suggests that with his renal failure, he now has a
   concurrent metabolic acidosis which makes it more difficult for us to
   maintain low tidal volumes.  Because of his high plateau pressures, we
   will come back down on his tidal volumes to 270 and increase his RR to
   28.  If this is well tolerated we can attempt to come down on his PEEP
   as tolerated.
   - Continue cisatriconium until tomorrow morning at least, then wean and
   reassess need for paralysis.
   - Daily CXR
   - Will wean PEEP as possible
   - Try to keep him fluid even w/ lasix to prevent further fluid in
   lungs.
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Flu positive, sputum cultures all negative.
   -Continue Vanco and Cipro (today day [**8-5**]).  Completed 5 days
   azithromycin.  Would prefer to not restart azithro as he has completed
   course and has this new rash.  Plan is still to stop antibiotics
   tomorrow despite low-grade fevers.
   -Sputum cultures all negative, flu positive.
   - Day [**5-3**] of peramivir.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Has muddy casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to
   have component of ATN.  AIN seems less likely w/ negative eos times
   two.  Patient has had decreasing urine output and increasing
   creatinine.
   - echo tomorrow am for possible cardiac source of poor forward flow.
   - renal ultrasound to rule out obstructive cause.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - Lasix 40mg IV as above.
   -Check and renally dose all medications
   - Start calcium acetate given rising phos and drop in calcium.
   - Switch to renal tube feeds.
   - Monitor potassium w/ [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   .
   # Rash: He has three days now of a macular-papular rash over his trunk,
   thighs and left arm which does not appear to be progressing.  Main
   differential is drug rash vs viral exanthema.  It seems unlikely that
   he would have a second viral infection and he is on several drugs that
   could potentially cause this exanthem. No significant eosinophils on
   diff.
   - No steroids at this time.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal Pain: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that leads
   to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   #Hyponatremia: Stable.  If hyponatremia becomes worse can attempt to
   fluid restrict, but not a problem for the time being.
   # Hypotension: Patient has been weaned off pressors, now with mild
   hypotension.  Currently stable.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Unclear why, will continue to trend.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His current conditions include respiratory failure, pneumonia, renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and risk for aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates severe ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition requiring aggressive management.
2. Pneumonia: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient's sputum cultures have been negative, suggesting a possible bacterial superinfection or inadequate treatment. Monitoring for any signs of worsening pneumonia or infection is crucial.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's oliguria, increasing creatinine levels, and muddy casts on urine sediment suggest acute renal failure. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or another cause. An echo and renal ultrasound have been ordered to evaluate for possible cardiac or obstructive causes.
4. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing fever suggest sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is essential to detect any deterioration.
5. Risk for Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration. Monitoring for signs of aspiration pneumonia and taking appropriate measures to prevent aspiration"

   - Cr elevated yesterday am and UOP dropping off around 3am, gave

   - Pt very desynchronous with vent and taking tidal volumes up to
   500ccs.  Decided to re-paralyze for now to keep tidal volumes low,
   prevent lung injury.
   - Spoke with parents.  Told them ARDS recovery can be long and slow.
   That at some point we may need to talk to them about tracheostomy and
   PEG tube placement.  That we were consulting renal.
   - Renal: urine sediment w/ brown and fine granular casts, no dysmorphic
   RBCs.  Recommend: wean antibiotics as possible, repeat urine lytes,
   Ueos, CBC w/ diff, do echo.  Expect Cr to rise before improving, no
   need for urgent HD.
   - Paralysis didn't happen until around 6pm -> next gas had higher pCO2
   and improved pO2. Went up on tidal volume to 300, improved pCO2 so no
   further changes.
   - w/ paralysis had tachycardia and decreased UOP. Gave 500cc bolus w/

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events: Reparalyzed.  TV increased d/t pH < 7.2.  Seen by renal team,
   remains oliguric.
   VS notable for: T1001.1, SBP 112-120, MAPs >80

   I/O +1.1L  yesterday.
   On exam:  Rash stable / improved.  Otherwise unchanged, as above.
   Labs notable for Cr now up to 2.7, K 5.0.
   CXR unchanged.
   Meds notable for versed, fentanyl, nimbex gtts; peramavir, d7/8 Cipro /
   Vanc
   Agree with plan to maintain paralysis. Will try to decrease TV again as
   PPlats are high, increase RR as tolerated, may want to support with
   bicarb if needed.  Will try titrating down peep as able.
   Renal failure with volume overload, also impairing respiratory status
   will try lasix to keep at least even, though ideally would like to
   diurese.  Appreciate renal recs.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe ARDS with a poor oxygenation/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio. He was re-paralyzed to allow for lower tidal volumes and maintain low levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). His recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a metabolic acidosis, which makes it challenging to maintain low tidal volumes. The plan is to decrease tidal volume to 270 mL and increase respiratory rate (RR) to 28. If tolerated, PEEP will be weaned as well.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. He tested positive for flu, and sputum cultures were negative. Antibiotics were started, and peramivir was administered. Daily ECG and skin checks will be performed to monitor for antiviral medication toxicity.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with muddy casts on urine sediment. This suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) seems less likely. An echocardiogram will be performed tomorrow morning to evaluate for a"

   - Paralysis didn't happen until around 6pm -> next gas had higher pCO2
   and improved pO2. Went up on tidal volume to 300, improved pCO2 so no
   further changes.
   - w/ paralysis had tachycardia and decreased UOP. Gave 500cc bolus w/
   improvement.

   .
   # Rash: He has a new macular-papular rash over his trunk, thighs and
   left arm.  Main differential is drug rash vs viral exanthema.  It seems
   unlikely that he would have a second viral infection and he is on
   several drugs that could potentially cause this exanthem.  The most
   likely cause at this point is the Zosyn, so we will switch to
   Ciprofloxacin for gram negative coverage.  We will continue peramivir
   for this time, but could stop it early if the rash worsens.
   - Switch Zosyn to cipro.  Continue Vanco and Peramivir.
   - Check LFTs and CBC w/ diff for possible DRESS.
   - No steroids at this time.
   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Flu positive, sputum cultures all negative.
   -Continue Vanco ([**8-5**]).  Because of rash switched to cipro for last two
   days.  Completed 5 days azithromycin.
   -Sputum cultures negative
   - Day [**4-2**] of peramivir.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200
   ARDS. Patient very desynchronous with the vent this morning despite
   very high levels of sedation.  We will re-paralyze for now with plan to
   re-evaluate on a daily basis as his respiratory status improves.
   - Restart cisatracuronium w/ bolus, then basal dose.
   - Daily CXR
   -Will wean PEEP as possible
   .
   #Renal failure: Patient has had decreasing urine output and increasing
   creatinine.  Fear ATN despite FENa yesterday of 0.2% suggesting
   primarily prerenal etiology.  Urine eos negative, making AIN less
   likely, though still possible.
   - consult renal
   - consider echo to evaluate cause of poor forward flow despite being
   many liters positive.
   - Re-check urine osm, urine electrolytes
   -D/c lasix for now.
   -Check and renally dose all medications
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: His abdomen has been persistently distended, though
   now he is stooling.  Per patient's father, patient having abdominal
   pain for 1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some
   improvement and some diarrhea prior to admission. CT abdomen [**12-7**] did
   not show any obstruction and C. diff is negative.  LFT
s show only a
   mildly elevated AST.
   - Bowel regimen .
   #Hyponatremia: Stable.  If hyponatremia becomes worse can attempt to
   fluid restrict, but not a problem for the time being.
   # Hypotension: Patient has been weaned off pressors, now with mild
   hypotension.  Currently stable.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Unclear why, will continue to trend.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia due to influenza A, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has renal failure, a rash, hyperglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and an inability to protect his airway. He has been treated with various medications, including peramivir, azithromycin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), ciprofloxacin, and steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Drug rash: The patient developed a macular-papular rash over his trunk, thighs, and left arm. The most likely cause is the Zosyn medication, so it will be switched to ciprofloxacin for gram-negative coverage. Monitoring for possible drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is recommended.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and a possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but no abscesses or effusions. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and peramivir. Daily ECG and skin checks will be conducted to monitor for toxicity from peramivir.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS/sepsis vs. PNA."

   - Pt very desynchronous with vent and taking tidal volumes up to
   500ccs.  Decided to re-paralyze for now to keep tidal volumes low,
   prevent lung injury.
   - Spoke with parents.  Told them ARDS recovery can be long and slow.
   That at some point we may need to talk to them about tracheostomy and
   PEG tube placement.  That we were consulting renal.
   - Renal: urine sediment w/ brown and fine granular casts, no dysmorphic
   RBCs.  Recommend: wean antibiotics as possible, repeat urine lytes,
   Ueos, CBC w/ diff, do echo.  Expect Cr to rise before improving, no
   need for urgent HD.
   - Paralysis didn't happen until around 6pm -> next gas had higher pCO2

   .
   # Rash: He has a new macular-papular rash over his trunk, thighs and
   left arm.  Main differential is drug rash vs viral exanthema.  It seems
   unlikely that he would have a second viral infection and he is on
   several drugs that could potentially cause this exanthem.  The most
   likely cause at this point is the Zosyn, so we will switch to
   Ciprofloxacin for gram negative coverage.  We will continue peramivir
   for this time, but could stop it early if the rash worsens.
   - Switch Zosyn to cipro.  Continue Vanco and Peramivir.
   - Check LFTs and CBC w/ diff for possible DRESS.
   - No steroids at this time.
   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Flu positive, sputum cultures all negative.
   -Continue Vanco ([**8-5**]).  Because of rash switched to cipro for last two
   days.  Completed 5 days azithromycin.
   -Sputum cultures negative
   - Day [**4-2**] of peramivir.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200
   ARDS. Patient very desynchronous with the vent this morning despite
   very high levels of sedation.  We will re-paralyze for now with plan to
   re-evaluate on a daily basis as his respiratory status improves.
   - Restart cisatracuronium w/ bolus, then basal dose.
   - Daily CXR
   -Will wean PEEP as possible
   .
   #Renal failure: Has muddy casts on urine sediment per renal, likely has
   component of ATN.  AIN seems less likely w/ negative eos times two.
   Patient has had decreasing urine output and increasing creatinine.
   Fear ATN despite FENa yesterday of 0.2% suggesting primarily prerenal
   etiology.  Urine eos negative, making AIN less likely, though still
   possible.
   - consult renal
   - consider echo to evaluate cause of poor forward flow despite being
   many liters positive.
   - Re-check urine osm, urine electrolytes
   -D/c lasix for now.
   -Check and renally dose all medications
   .
   #Abdominal Pain: His abdomen has been persistently distended, though
   now he is stooling.  Per patient's father, patient having abdominal
   pain for 1-2 days which was being treated with heating pad with some
   improvement and some diarrhea prior to admission. CT abdomen [**12-7**] did
   not show any obstruction and C. diff is negative.  LFT
s show only a
   mildly elevated AST.
   - Bowel regimen .
   #Hyponatremia: Stable.  If hyponatremia becomes worse can attempt to
   fluid restrict, but not a problem for the time being.
   # Hypotension: Patient has been weaned off pressors, now with mild
   hypotension.  Currently stable.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Unclear why, will continue to trend.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin s/s as patient currently NPO

   .
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely etiology ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200
   ARDS. Patient re-paralyzed yesterday to allow for lower tidal volumes.
   His gas this morning suggests that with his renal failure, he now has a
   concurrent metabolic acidosis which makes it more difficult for us to
   maintain low tidal volumes.  Because of his high plateau pressures, we
   will come back down on his tidal volumes to 270 and increase his RR to
   28.  If this is well tolerated we can attempt to come down on his PEEP
   as tolerated.
   - Continue cisatriconium until tomorrow morning at least, then wean and
   reassess need for paralysis.
   - Daily CXR
   - Will wean PEEP as possible
   - Try to keep him fluid even w/ lasix to prevent further fluid in
   lungs.
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and
   possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but
   no abscesses or effusions. Flu positive, sputum cultures all negative.
   -Continue Vanco and Cipro (today day [**8-5**]).  Completed 5 days
   azithromycin.  Would prefer to not restart azithro as he has completed
   course and has this new rash.  Plan is still to stop antibiotics
   tomorrow despite low-grade fevers.
   -Sputum cultures all negative, flu positive.
   - Day [**5-3**] of peramivir.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Has muddy casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to
   have component of ATN.  AIN seems less likely w/ negative eos times
   two.  Patient has had decreasing urine output and increasing
   creatinine.
   - echo tomorrow am for possible cardiac source of poor forward flow.
   - renal ultrasound to rule out obstructive cause.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - Lasix 40mg IV as above.
   -Check and renally dose all medications
   - Start calcium acetate given rising phos and drop in calcium.
   - Switch to renal tube feeds.
   - Monitor potassium w/ [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   .
   # Rash: He has three days now of a macular-papular rash over his trunk,
   thighs and left arm which does not appear to be progressing.  Main
   differential is drug rash vs viral exanthema.  It seems unlikely that
   he would have a second viral infection and he is on several drugs that
   could potentially cause this exanthem. No significant eosinophils on
   diff.
   - No steroids at this time.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal Pain: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that leads
   to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   #Hyponatremia: Stable.  If hyponatremia becomes worse can attempt to
   fluid restrict, but not a problem for the time being.
   # Hypotension: Patient has been weaned off pressors, now with mild
   hypotension.  Currently stable.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Unclear why, will continue to trend.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, constipation, hyperglycemia, ARDS, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. The most likely etiology of respiratory failure is ARDS/sepsis vs pneumonia. The patient has been re-paralyzed to allow for lower tidal volumes, and his gas suggests a concurrent metabolic acidosis due to renal failure.

The plan includes continuing cisatracurium until tomorrow morning, weaning and reassessing the need for paralysis, daily chest X-ray, and weaning PEEP as tolerated. Fluid balance should be maintained to prevent further fluid in the lungs.

Regarding pneumonia, the patient is suspected to have severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. Chest CT shows severe pneumonia, but no abscesses or effusions. The patient is flu-positive, and sputum cultures have all been negative. Antibiotics will be continued for another day, and peramivir will be given for 5 days.

Renal failure is indicated by muddy casts on urine sediment, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). An interstitial nephritis (AIN) seems less likely. The patient's urine output is decreasing, and creatinine"

   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200 (today 88), consistent w/ ARDS. Patient
   re-paralyzed Saturday to allow for lower tidal volumes.  He continues
   to have high peak pressures and to pull large volumes when paralysis is
   lowered, so we will keep him paralyzed for now.
   - Continue cisatriconium until likely tomorrow or the day after.
   - We will give inhalers in case central airway narrowing is increasing
   his peak pressures.
   - Daily CXR
   - Will wean PEEP as possible
   - fluid overload (LOS 11 liters positive) likely contributing.  Now
   that urine output is improving we will attempt to dialyze.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider tracheostomy considering likelihood of prolonged
   intubation.
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for now.
   -Continue Vanc/Cipro/Azithromycin for time being.
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving.
   - Repeat sputum cultures.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output has improved today.  Has muddy casts on
   urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  AIN seems
   less likely w/ negative eos times two.  Renal ultrasound negative for
   obstruction.
   - echo done, but need to follow-up read.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - Lasix 40mg IV as above.  If well tolerated will likely need to go up
   on dose.  Goal 1L negative today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - Continue to renally dose all medications
   - Phosphate levels improving with calcium acetate.
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn switched to cipro.
   No signs of DRESS.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal Pain: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that leads
   to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Unclear why, will continue to trend.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.
- He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A.
- The patient has been intubated and paralyzed to manage his respiratory failure, which is likely caused by ARDS/sepsis or pneumonia.
- His peak pressures and large volume ventilation indicate the need for continued paralysis for now.
- Inhalers are being given to address possible central airway narrowing.
- Daily chest X-rays are being performed, and PEEP will be weaned as possible.
- Fluid overload is contributing to his condition, and attempts will be made to dialyze him now that his urine output is improving.
- A tracheostomy may be considered for prolonged intubation.
- The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. Antibiotic courses have been completed, and cultures have been negative except for influenza virus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will continue for now.
- Peramivir will be continued for a total of 10 days as the patient is not improving.
- Sputum cultures will be repeated, and daily ECG and skin checks will be done to monitor for toxicity while on peramivir.
- The patient's renal function has improved, with muddy casts on urine sediment indicating a component of acute tubular"

   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200 consistent w/ ARDS. Patient re-paralyzed
   Saturday to allow for lower tidal volumes.  He continues to have high
   peak pressures and to pull large volumes when paralysis is lowered, so
   we will keep him paralyzed for now. FiO2 able to be lowered slightly
   overnight to 60%, then needed to go back up to 70%. Will wean down
   today tolerating lower FiO2. Inhalers did not improve peak pressures,
   so will d/c as patient has been tachycardic, albuterol may be
   contributing
   - Continue cisatriconium until tomorrow to allow for further
   improvement of ARDS prior to d/c of paralysis
   - Daily CXR
   - Will wean PEEP as possible
 from 18
16 today, see how he tolerates
   - fluid overload likely contributing.  Able to make -800 mL yesterday.
   Goal negative 2L today
   -Start Lasix gtt
   -Consult thoracic surgery, once wean PEEP will need trach and PEG
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course.
   -Continue Vanco x14 days, Azithro 10 day course per ID
   -ID requesting change from cipro for GN coverage, suggested cefepime,
   will ask for aztreonam instead given previous rash with beta lactam
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done

   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia due to influenza A. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, inability to protect airway, renal failure, hyperglycemia, and constipation.

The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was later extubated. However, he required reintubation due to respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, high respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels. The imaging shows an improvement in the chest X-ray.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for a total of 14 days, continuing peramivir for a total of 10 days, and monitoring for influenza virus toxicity. The patient's renal failure requires close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels. Lasix gtt has been started to address fluid overload. The patient's rash seems to be improving now that Zosyn has been switched to ciprofloxacin. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS or pneumonia. The peak pressures remain high, and the patient continues to pull large volumes when paralysis is lowered. Therefore,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has been unstable, with ongoing requirements for paralytics, insulin, and diuretics.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 114 bpm, and their blood pressure is within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 91% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, PEEP at 18 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, and plateau pressure of 31 cmH2O.

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, renal dysfunction with an increased serum creatinine level, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated. Imaging reveals an improvement in chest X-ray findings.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, constipation, hyperglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. The patient is also at risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect the airway.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further"

   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200 consistent w/ ARDS. Patient re-paralyzed
   Saturday to allow for lower tidal volumes.  He continues to have high
   peak pressures and to pull large volumes when paralysis is lowered, so
   we will keep him paralyzed for now. FiO2 able to be lowered slightly
   overnight to 60%, then needed to go back up to 70%. Will wean down
   today tolerating lower FiO2. Inhalers did not improve peak pressures,
   so will d/c as patient has been tachycardic, albuterol may be
   contributing
   - Continue cisatriconium until tomorrow to allow for further
   improvement of ARDS prior to d/c of paralysis
   - Daily CXR
   - Will wean PEEP as possible
 from 18
16 today, see how he tolerates
   - fluid overload likely contributing.  Able to make -800 mL yesterday.
   Goal negative 2L today
   -Start Lasix gtt
   -Consult thoracic surgery, once wean PEEP will need trach and PEG
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course.
   -Continue Vanco x14 days, Azithro 10 day course per ID
   -ID requesting change from cipro for GN coverage, suggested cefepime,
   will ask for aztreonam instead given previous rash with beta lactam
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-22**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output has improved today.  Has muddy casts on
   urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  AIN seems
   less likely w/ negative eos times two.  Renal ultrasound negative for
   obstruction.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal 2L negative today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - Continue to renally dose all medications
   - Phosphate levels improving with calcium acetate.
   -recheck vancomycin level
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn switched to cipro.
   No signs of DRESS.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal Pain: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that leads
   to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Bicarb has normalized with diuresis.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin sliding scale
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.  Will discuss

   feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including tachycardia, rash, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and airway management issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to ARDS. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure if the patient does not improve or if there is a recurrence of infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with pneumonia, which may still be present despite completing courses of antibiotics. There is a risk of progression or development of antibiotic-resistant infections.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to sepsis and potential use of nephrotoxic drugs. This puts the patient at risk for ongoing renal dysfunction or the need for dialysis.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and his blood glucose levels remain elevated. This increases the risk of further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate has been consistently elevated, indicating possible underlying cardiac dysfunction or response to infection and stress.
6. Rash: The patient developed a rash, which may be related to drug reactions or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia due to influenza A, which has progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He also has acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and an inability to protect his airway.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are essential.
2. Pneumonia: Despite completing courses of antibiotics, the patient still has a possible bacterial superinfection. Continuous monitoring of cultures and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary will be important.
3. Renal failure: The patient's urine output has improved, but he still requires close monitoring of renal function. Diuretics may be required to manage fluid overload.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and insulin therapy should be continued to manage his glycemic control.
5. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis is currently without organ dysfunction, there is a risk of progression to septic shock. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial.
6. Constipation: The patient has poor bowel motility, leading to bowel distention. Regular"

   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200 consistent w/ ARDS. Patient re-paralyzed
   Saturday to allow for lower tidal volumes.  He continues to have high
   peak pressures and to pull large volumes when paralysis is lowered, so
   we will keep him paralyzed for now.
   - Continue cisatriconium until likely tomorrow or the day after.
   - We will give inhalers in case central airway narrowing is increasing
   his peak pressures.
   - Daily CXR
   - Will wean PEEP as possible
   - fluid overload (LOS 11 liters positive) likely contributing.  Able to
   make -800 mL yesterday.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider tracheostomy considering likelihood of prolonged
   intubation.
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for now.
   -Continue Vanc/Cipro/Azithromycin for time being.
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output has improved today.  Has muddy casts on
   urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  AIN seems
   less likely w/ negative eos times two.  Renal ultrasound negative for
   obstruction.
   - echo done, but need to follow-up read.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - Lasix 40mg IV as above.  If well tolerated will likely need to go up
   on dose.  Goal 1L negative today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - Continue to renally dose all medications
   - Phosphate levels improving with calcium acetate.
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn switched to cipro.
   No signs of DRESS.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal Pain: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that leads
   to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Bicarb has normalized.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin sliding scale
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.  [**Month (only) 8**] require
   PEG tube given likelihood of prolonged intubation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The patient presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia caused by influenza A, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and an inability to protect the airway.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS is causing severe respiratory distress, and there is a risk of further deterioration. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: Despite completing courses of antibiotics, the patient still has a risk of developing a bacterial superinfection. The negative blood cultures suggest no active bacterial infection at the moment.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring urine output and renal function will be crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Constipation: The patient's paralysis increases the risk of constipation and bowel obstruction. Gentle tube feeds and bowel regimen should be continued to prevent these complications.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II requires close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin therapy.

6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which needs to be managed with Synthroid.

7. GERD: The patient has gastroes"

   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200 consistent w/ ARDS. Patient re-paralyzed
   Saturday to allow for lower tidal volumes.  He continues to have high
   peak pressures and to pull large volumes when paralysis is lowered, so
   we will keep him paralyzed for now.
   - Continue cisatriconium until likely tomorrow or the day after.
   - We will give inhalers in case central airway narrowing is increasing
   his peak pressures.
   - Daily CXR
   - Will wean PEEP as possible
   - fluid overload (LOS 11 liters positive) likely contributing.  Able to
   make -800 mL yesterday.
   -Lasix 40mg IV BID again today.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider tracheostomy considering likelihood of prolonged
   intubation.
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for now.
   -Continue Vanc/Cipro/Azithromycin for time being.
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving.
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output has improved today.  Has muddy casts on
   urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  AIN seems
   less likely w/ negative eos times two.  Renal ultrasound negative for
   obstruction.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - Lasix 40mg IV as above.  If well tolerated will likely need to go up
   on dose.  Goal 1L negative today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - Continue to renally dose all medications
   - Phosphate levels improving with calcium acetate.
   -recheck vancomycin level
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn switched to cipro.
   No signs of DRESS.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal Pain: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that leads
   to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Bicarb has normalized with diuresis.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

   #DM II: Insulin sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including tachycardia, renal failure, hyperglycemia, pneumonia, and sepsis. He also has airway management issues, constipation, acidosis, hypothyroidism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with persistent need for invasive ventilation and high peak pressures. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Pneumonia: Despite completing courses of antibiotics, the patient's pneumonia is severe and may require prolonged antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or treatment failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with muddy casts on urine sediment, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This may require dialysis or continued conservative management.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with high blood glucose levels. Poor glycemic control can lead to complications such as diabetic keto"

","The patient is a 56-year-old man with a chief complaint of influenza who subsequently developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). He has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is sedated and unresponsive with decreased movement and tone. 

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 552 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 8.8 g/dL, low hematocrit (Hct) of 26.3%, and elevated platelet count (Plt) of 432. His blood chemistry results indicate elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 2.6 mg/dL, low total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 24 mmHg, and elevated lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of tachycardia, which has been managed with metoprolol and lopressor. There is also mention of respiratory distress, with the patient requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation levels are consistently below normal, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation.

The patient's renal function appears to be impaired, as evidenced by the elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. There are also signs of hyperglycemia, potentially due to stress or underlying insulin resistance.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe lung condition characterized by impaired gas exchange and diffuse lung injury. ARDS can be caused by various factors, including pneumonia or sepsis.

The patient has been identified as having sepsis without organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. In this case, the infection may be contributing to the development of ARDS.

Other issues mentioned include constipation, rash, and pneumonia. The patient's airway protection is also a concern due to altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance.

Given these findings, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, progression of ARDS, development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), further decline in renal function, uncontrolled hyperglycemia,"

   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200 consistent w/ ARDS. P/F slightly improved,
   217. Patient re-paralyzed Saturday to allow for lower tidal volumes.
   He continues to have high peak pressures and to pull large volumes when
   paralysis is lowered, so we will keep him paralyzed for now. Willing to
   tolerate PaO2 55. Patient not very negative yesterday because had
   episodes of hypotension. Tolerating lasix drip well now. Thoracic
   surgery consulted, will see pt today to evaluate for future trach & PEG
   placement in OR.
   - D/c cisatriconium
   - Daily CXR
   - fluid overload likely contributing. Goal negative 3L today
   -Start Lasix gtt
   -decrease FiO2 to 50, will then reassess with ABG
   - if tolerates decrease in FiO2, then decrease PEEP to 14.
   .
   #Fevers: Patient febrile overnight. Currently on broad spectrum
   antibiotics. Not covering for VRE, yeast. Concern for possible yeast
   line infection vs. C diff. Line site looks good making concern for this
   slightly lower.
   -panculture (blood, urine, sputum, stool for C.diff)
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course.
   -Continue Vanco x14 days, aztreonam for 14 day total course for GN
   coverage, Azithro 10 day course per ID
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-22**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output has improved today.  Has muddy casts on
   urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  AIN seems
   less likely w/ negative eos times two.  Renal ultrasound negative for
   obstruction.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal 3L negative today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - Continue to renally dose all medications
   - Phosphate levels improving with calcium acetate.
   -recheck vancomycin level
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.
   -Consult ophthomology
   .
   #Tachycardia: EKG done yesterday, felt to be likely multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started on Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not
   increase as patient tolerates lasix drip better when blood pressure
   slightly increased.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Bicarb has normalized with diuresis.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension who presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and sedated, paralyzed, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including tachycardia, rash, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, constipation, and an eye infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing severe respiratory failure due to ARDS, which is causing difficulty in oxygenation. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is below 200, indicating severe ARDS. The current management includes paralysis to allow for lower tidal volumes and maintaining FiO2 at 60%.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. Despite completing courses of antibiotics, cultures have been negative except for influenza virus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for a total of 14 days.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with muddy casts on urine sediment, suggesting a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Angiograph-associated interstitial nephritis (AIN) seems less likely. Renal ultrasound is negative for obstruction. Lasix drip has been started to promote diuresis and improve urine output. Ph"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - consult surgery for trach placement->didn't happen early enough, will
   get done first thing in AM.
   - ID agreed w/ aztreonam instead of cefepime or meropenem for gram
   negative coverage.
   - patient not at goal UOP, but initially limited by hypotension.
   - tolerated PEEP of 16 very well.  Tried 15, but patient's pO2 worsened
   at 9pm, so we went back to 16.
   - patient remained tachycardic.  Tolerated 5mg IV lopressor, so started
   12.5mg  PO BID.
   - at 2 am got turned onto right side, desated to 85-86%, improved with
   100% O2 and turning onto left side, worried that [**Last Name (LF) 10004**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] FiO2

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension presenting with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, rash, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, ARDS, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, inability to protect airway, and possible bacterial superinfection. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, pneumonia, renal failure, hyperglycemia, and sepsis. The patient's respiratory status is critical due to ARDS, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Pneumonia is already present, and there is a concern for bacterial superinfection. The patient has acute renal failure with muddy casts on urine sediment, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Hyperglycemia is also present, indicating poor glycemic control. Sepsis without organ dysfunction is a concern given the patient's ongoing infection and inflammatory response. 

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of these complications to improve his clinical status and prevent further deterioration."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - consult surgery for trach placement->didn't happen early enough, will
   get done first thing in AM.
   - ID agreed w/ aztreonam instead of cefepime or meropenem for gram
   negative coverage.
   - patient not at goal UOP, but initially limited by hypotension.
   - tolerated PEEP of 16 very well.  Tried 15, but patient's pO2 worsened
   at 9pm, so we went back to 16.
   - patient remained tachycardic.  Tolerated 5mg IV lopressor, so started
   12.5mg  PO BID.
   - at 2 am got turned onto right side, desated to 85-86%, improved with
   100% O2 and turning onto left side, worried that [**Last Name (LF) 10004**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] FiO2

   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis vs PNA. p/F<200 consistent w/ ARDS. P/F slightly improved,
   217. Patient re-paralyzed Saturday to allow for lower tidal volumes.
   He continues to have high peak pressures and to pull large volumes when
   paralysis is lowered, so we will keep him paralyzed for now. Willing to
   tolerate PaO2 55. Patient not very negative yesterday because had
   episodes of hypotension. Tolerating lasix drip well now. Thoracic
   surgery consulted, will see pt today to evaluate for future trach & PEG
   placement in OR.
   - D/c cisatriconium
   - Daily CXR
   - fluid overload likely contributing. Goal negative 3L today
   -Start Lasix gtt
   -decrease FiO2 to 50, will then reassess with ABG
   - if tolerates decrease in FiO2, then decrease PEEP to 14.
   .
   #Fevers: Patient febrile overnight. Currently on broad spectrum
   antibiotics. Not covering for VRE, yeast. Concern for possible yeast
   line infection vs. C diff. Line site looks good making concern for this
   slightly lower.
   -panculture (blood, urine, sputum, stool for C.diff)
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course.
   -Continue Vanco x14 days, aztreonam for 14 day total course for GN
   coverage, Azithro 10 day course per ID
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-22**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output has improved today.  Has muddy casts on
   urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  AIN seems
   less likely w/ negative eos times two.  Renal ultrasound negative for
   obstruction.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal 3L negative today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - Continue to renally dose all medications
   - Phosphate levels improving with calcium acetate.
   -recheck vancomycin level
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.
   -Consult ophthomology
   .
   #Tachycardia: EKG done yesterday, felt to be likely multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started on Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not
   increase as patient tolerates lasix drip better when blood pressure
   slightly increased.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   .
   #Acidosis; Patient has a normal lactate, stably decreased bicarb.
   Bicarb has normalized with diuresis.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin drip
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.  Will discuss
   with nutrition if can change from renal tube feeds to pulmonary tube
   feeds

The patient has several medical complications including tachycardia, rash, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, ARDS, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and inability to protect airway.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio. The patient has been paralyzed to allow for lower tidal volumes and has high peak pressures and pulls large volumes when paralysis is lowered, so he will remain paralyzed for now. The goal is to maintain a PaO2 of 55.

The patient is febrile overnight and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is concern for possible yeast line infection versus C. difficile. Cultures have been done, and if positive, the lines will be discontinued.

The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. He has completed his courses of antibiotics, and cultures have been negative except for influenza virus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will continue for a total of 14 days.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with muddy casts on urine sediment and a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) seems less likely with negative eosinophils. Renal ultrasound is negative for obstruction.

   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and possible bacterial
   pneumonia. p/F<200 today is improving and outside of ARDS range and
   patient is breathing well off of paralysis. His improvement seems to be
   mostly due to very good diuresis.  Thoracic surgery consulted and are
   willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or lower.
   - Will come down on PEEP to 12 this morning.  If tolerated we can
   consider coming down further.
   - Daily CXR
   - Excellent diuresis yesterday, will try for 3L negative again today if
   tolerated.
   -If decreasing PEEP is well tolerated we can maybe even consider
   decreasing sedation and moving to pressure support.
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient afebrile overnight but he has a slight
   increase in his WBC count. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not
   covering for VRE, yeast. Concern for possible yeast line infection vs.
   C diff. Line site looks good making concern for this slightly lower.
   -panculture (blood, urine, sputum, stool for C.diff)
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course.
   -Continue Vanco x14 days, aztreonam for 14 day total course for GN
   coverage, Azithro 10 day course per ID
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-22**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - renal team has signed off
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal 3L negative today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - Will check meds for possible changes in light of improving creatinint
   - With improving renal function and normal phosphate, will consider
   stopping calcium acetate.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who suggested some changes to his eye-drops and
   outpatient follow-up.
   .
   #Tachycardia: EKG done yesterday, felt to be likely multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started on Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not
   increase as patient tolerates lasix drip better when blood pressure
   slightly increased.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today, but not concerning.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin drip

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including mechanical ventilation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications for his multiple medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to ARDS/sepsis combined with fluid overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to prevent further respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of leukocytosis and fever, indicating a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of sepsis and adjust treatment accordingly.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection need to be addressed. Completion of antibiotic courses and continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics for a total of 14 days are recommended. Additionally, antiviral treatment for influenza should be continued.

4. Renal failure: The patient has shown improvement in urine output and creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of diuretic therapy are necessary to prevent fluid overload and further renal deterioration.

5. Eye redness and discharge: The patient's contact lenses may contribute to the eye symptoms."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia due to influenza A. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medication for influenza. His urine output has improved, but he still has some renal dysfunction. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, eye redness and discharge, abdominal distension, and hypothyroidism. His diabetes mellitus type II is being managed with an insulin drip. He is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and has multiple lines for access. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending improvement in respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia or lung injury.
2. Nosocomial infection: Given the prolonged hospital stay and multiple lines, the patient is at risk of developing nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or wound infections.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of influenza and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has shown significant progress in terms of diuresis and improvement in pulmonary function. 

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. The ICU team has implemented measures to reduce this risk, such as increasing the H2 blocker dose.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. The patient is receiving prophylactic measures, including boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.

3. Shock: Although the patient's shock has resolved, there is still a risk of its recurrence due to ongoing critical illness and potential organ dysfunction.

4. Corneal ulcer: The patient has an early corneal ulcer, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.

5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and careful monitoring of renal function is necessary.

6. Nosocomial infections: As the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections and central line-associated pneumonia.

7. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 56-year-old man with a chief complaint of influenza and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes obesity, diabetes, and a history of smoking. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 150/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on the ventilator. The patient's oxygenation has improved significantly, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 230.

The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchi on lung auscultation, right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and warm skin with folliculitis. His neurological examination shows unresponsiveness with normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 591 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 124 to 155 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count of 12.0 K/uL. Other lab results show normal electrolyte levels and liver function tests.

Imaging reveals a chest X-ray that is consistent with ARDS.

The patient's condition has improved significantly since admission. He is now weaned off vasoactive medications, and his renal function has returned to normal"

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/70 to 160/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 280 mL and respiratory support.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 591 K/uL, high blood glucose levels ranging from 124 to 155 mg/dL, low hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and other abnormal lab values. The patient also has a rash described as folliculitis and right and left lower extremity edema.

Imaging shows a chest X-ray that is perhaps a bit worse. The patient has been prescribed various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, sedatives, pain relievers, and other ICU medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, further deterioration of renal function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential"

   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and possible bacterial
   pneumonia. p/F<200 today is improving and outside of ARDS range and
   patient is breathing well off of paralysis. His improvement seems to be
   mostly due to very good diuresis.  Thoracic surgery consulted and are
   willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or lower. PEEP now 8.
   - Daily CXR
   - Excellent diuresis yesterday, however became alkalotic
   -If decreasing PEEP is well tolerated we can maybe even consider
   decreasing sedation and moving to pressure support.
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient afebrile overnight, WBC count trending
   down. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not covering for VRE,
   yeast. Concern for possible yeast line infection vs. C diff. Line site
   looks good making concern for this slightly lower.
   -panculture (blood, urine, sputum, stool for C.diff)
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course. Finished azithromycin yesterday.
   -Continue Vanco x14 days, aztreonam for 14 day total course for GN
   coverage,
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-20**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - renal team has signed off
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal 3L negative today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - Will check meds for possible changes in light of improving creatinint
   - With improving renal function and normal phosphate, will consider
   stopping calcium acetate.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who suggested some changes to his eye-drops and
   outpatient follow-up.
   .
   #Tachycardia: EKG done yesterday, felt to be likely multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started on Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not
   increase as patient tolerates lasix drip better when blood pressure
   slightly increased.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today, but not concerning.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin drip
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: peripherals, Aline, IJ Central line
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with paralyzed extremities. His condition has shown some improvement, with a decrease in PEEP and better oxygenation. However, he still requires mechanical ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

The patient's renal function has also improved, with increased urine output and decreasing creatinine levels. There are concerns about possible yeast line infection and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's tachycardia is being managed with Lopressor. His rash is improving now that the offending antibiotic has been discontinued. The patient's abdominal distension is likely due to poor motility caused by paralysis. 

Other ongoing issues include hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type II, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient's code status remains as full code. The patient's disposition is pending improved respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to ARDS and possible bacterial pneumonia. Continued monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be essential.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his immunocompromised state and ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and response to antibiotics is crucial.
3. Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal function has improved, there is still a risk of acute renal failure. Monitoring urine output, electrolyte levels, and adjusting medication dosages accordingly will be important.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and a possible bacterial superinfection. Completion of antibiotic therapy and further evaluation of sputum cultures will be necessary.
5. Line Infections: There is a concern for possible yeast line infection or C. difficile infection. Culturing the lines and close monitoring for signs of infection are recommended.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be multifactorial and requires further investigation and management.
7. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient's paralysis may lead to decreased bowel motility, resulting in constipation or obstipation. Regular assessment and management of bowel function will be necessary.
8. Eye Redness and Discharge: The patient has eye redness and discharge, possibly due to contact lens use. Ophthalmology follow-up is advised.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
10. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's diabetes control should be monitored, and insulin management will continue.
11. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: The patient's GERD should be managed with ongoing proton pump inhibitor therapy.
12. Abdominal Distension: The patient's abdominal distension should be evaluated and managed to prevent complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.

It is important to continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, renal function, and infection parameters. Frequent reassessment of the patient's overall condition and prompt management of any complications will be crucial for his recovery."

   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and possible bacterial
   pneumonia. p/F<200 today is improving and outside of ARDS range and
   patient is breathing well off of paralysis. His improvement seems to be
   mostly due to very good diuresis.  Thoracic surgery consulted and are
   willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or lower. PEEP now 8.
   Tolerating pressure support well.
   - Daily CXR
   - Excellent diuresis yesterday, however became alkalotic
   -Will continue diuresis , check evening lytes and acetazolamide
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient afebrile overnight, WBC count trending
   down. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not covering for VRE,
   yeast. Concern for possible yeast line infection vs. C diff. Line site
   looks good making concern for this slightly lower.
   -panculture (blood, urine, sputum, stool for C.diff)
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course. Finished azithromycin yesterday.
   -Continue Vanco x14 days, aztreonam for 14 day total course for GN
   coverage,
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-20**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - renal team has signed off
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal 3L negative today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - Will check meds for possible changes in light of improving creatinint
   - With improving renal function and normal phosphate, will consider
   stopping calcium acetate.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who suggested some changes to his eye-drops and
   outpatient follow-up.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today, but not concerning.
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   - Bowel regimen.
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin drip

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by ARDS, sepsis, fluid overload, and possible bacterial pneumonia. His p/F ratio is improving and he is tolerating pressure support well.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient was previously febrile and had leukocytosis, but is now afebrile. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated and cultures have been obtained. There is a concern for possible yeast line infection versus Clostridium difficile. Daily cultures will be checked before discontinuing lines.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and a possible bacterial superinfection. He has completed his courses of antibiotics, and cultures have been negative except for influenza virus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for a total of 14 days.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving with increased urine output and decreased creatinine. There are muddy casts on the urine sediment, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The renal team has signed off, and diuresis will be continued.

5. Eye Redness and Discharge: The patient had contact lenses in his"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has several medical complications, including tachycardia, renal failure, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and an inability to protect his airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS, sepsis, fluid overload, and possible bacterial pneumonia. Daily chest X-rays and continued diuresis are planned.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, and cultures are being monitored.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and a possible bacterial superinfection. Antibiotics have been completed, and cultures have been negative except for influenza virus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for a total of 14 days.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output and creatinine levels have improved, suggesting an improvement in renal function. The renal team has signed off, and Lasix gtt. is being used to maintain negative fluid balance.
5. Eye Redness and Discharge: The patient had contact lenses"

   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and possible bacterial
   pneumonia. p/F<200 initially, today is improving and outside of ARDS
   range and patient is breathing well off of paralysis. His improvement
   seems to be mostly due to very good diuresis.  Thoracic surgery
   consulted and are willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or
   lower. PEEP now 8. thoracic surgery aware, patient planned for OR
   Monday unless off ventilator by then.  Tolerating pressure support
   well. Patient became agitated off sedation, will need to wean sedation
   slowly as this is likely the major barrier to extubation.
   - Daily CXR
   - Excellent diuresis yesterday, however became alkalotic
   -Will continue diuresis , check evening lytes and acetazolamide  x1
   now, will give again if needed
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient afebrile overnight, WBC count trending
   down. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not covering for VRE,
   yeast. Concern for possible yeast line infection vs. C diff. Line site
   looks good making concern for this slightly lower; blood cultures
   negative to date.
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course. Finished azithromycin yesterday.
   -Continue Vanco (day [**1-11**]), aztreonam for (day12/14) day total course
   for GN coverage
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-20**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - renal team has signed off
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal as negative as possible given that patient is
   relatively euvolemic, may not be able to be diuresed much more.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - With improving renal function and normal phosphate, will consider
   stopping calcium acetate.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who suggested some changes to his eye-drops and
   outpatient follow-up.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   -Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, will check C. diff to ensure
   that he is not infected given that he is on a large number of
   antibiotics.
   - Bowel regimen.
   -C diff cultures

   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and possible bacterial
   pneumonia. p/F<200 initially, today is improving and outside of ARDS
   range and patient is breathing well off of paralysis. His improvement
   seems to be mostly due to very good diuresis.  Thoracic surgery
   consulted and are willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or
   lower. PEEP now 8. thoracic surgery aware, patient planned for OR
   Monday unless off ventilator by then.  Tolerating pressure support
   well. Patient became agitated off sedation, will need to wean sedation
   slowly as this is likely the major barrier to extubation.
   - Daily CXR
   - Excellent diuresis yesterday, however became alkalotic
   -Will continue diuresis , check evening lytes and acetazolamide  x1
   now, will give again if needed
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient afebrile overnight, WBC count trending
   down. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not covering for VRE,
   yeast. Concern for possible yeast line infection vs. C diff. Line site
   looks good making concern for this slightly lower; blood cultures
   negative to date.
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course. Finished azithromycin yesterday.
   -Continue Vanco (day [**1-11**]), aztreonam for (day12/14) day total course
   for GN coverage
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-20**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - renal team has signed off
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal as negative as possible given that patient is
   relatively euvolemic, may not be able to be diuresed much more.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - With improving renal function and normal phosphate, will consider
   stopping calcium acetate.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who suggested some changes to his eye-drops and
   outpatient follow-up.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   -Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, will check C. diff to ensure
   that he is not infected given that he is on a large number of
   antibiotics.
   - Bowel regimen.
   -C diff cultures
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Insulin drip
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension who presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The cause of respiratory failure is likely a combination of ARDS, sepsis, fluid overload, and possible bacterial pneumonia. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio was initially below 200 but has improved and is now within a normal range. The patient is tolerating pressure support well and is planned for surgery on Monday unless off the ventilator by then.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has had low-grade fevers overnight, and the WBC count is trending up. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are not covering VRE or yeast. There is a concern for possible yeast line infection versus C. difficile. Blood cultures are negative to date. The lines will be discontinued if the culture is positive, but the patient's acute need for lines will be taken into consideration before doing so.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. The patient has completed his courses of antibiotics, and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for a total of 14 days due to the severity of the illness.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output and creatinine have improved, indicating a"

   Assessment and Plan
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and possible bacterial
   pneumonia. p/F<200 initially, today is improving and outside of ARDS
   range and patient is breathing well off of paralysis. His improvement
   seems to be mostly due to very good diuresis.  Thoracic surgery
   consulted and are willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or
   lower. Patient planned for OR Monday unless off ventilator by then.
   Tolerating pressure support well. Patient became agitated off sedation,
   will need to wean sedation slowly as this is likely the major barrier
   to extubation.
   - Try to wean pressure support back to 8 so that can get trach on
   Monday; ENT will leave pre-op surgery recs in chart tomorrow.
   - Daily CXR
   -Will continue diuresis , check evening lytes and give acetazolamide if
   needed
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with low-grade fevers overnight, WBC
   count trending up. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not
   covering for VRE, yeast. Concern for possible yeast line infection vs.
   C diff. Line site looks good making concern for this slightly lower;
   blood cultures negative to date.
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   - plan to trach and take tube out on Mon
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course. Finished azithromycin yesterday.
   - Continue Vanco (day 13/14), aztreonam for (day13/14) day total course
   for GN coverage
   - Stop peramivir; completed 10 day course
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - renal team has signed off
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal as negative as possible given that patient is
   relatively euvolemic, may not be able to be diuresed much more.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - With improving renal function and normal phosphate, will consider
   stopping calcium acetate.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
   .
   # R hand swelling
   - U/S of R arm
    .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A infection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, peramivir for influenza, and has negative sputum cultures.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe ARDS and respiratory failure, which is likely due to a combination of ARDS, sepsis, fluid overload, and possible bacterial pneumonia. His initial PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio was less than 200, but it has improved and is now outside of the ARDS range. The patient tolerates pressure support well and is planned for tracheostomy and extubation once stable.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has had low-grade fevers overnight, and his white blood cell count is trending up. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there is concern for possible yeast line infection versus Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Blood cultures have been negative to date.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. He has completed his courses of antibiotics, and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for a total of"

   Assessment and Plan
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and possible bacterial
   pneumonia. p/F<200 initially, today is improving and outside of ARDS
   range and patient is breathing well off of paralysis. His improvement
   seems to be mostly due to very good diuresis.  Thoracic surgery
   consulted and are willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or
   lower. Patient planned for OR Monday unless off ventilator by then.
   Tolerating pressure support well. Patient became agitated off sedation,
   will need to wean sedation slowly as this is likely the major barrier
   to extubation.
   - Try to wean pressure support back to 8 so that can get trach on
   Monday; ENT will leave pre-op surgery recs in chart tomorrow.
   - Daily CXR
   -Will continue diuresis , check evening lytes and give acetazolamide if
   needed
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with low-grade fevers overnight, WBC
   count trending up. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not
   covering for VRE, yeast. Concern for possible yeast line infection vs.
   C diff. Line site looks good making concern for this slightly lower;
   blood cultures negative to date.
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   - plan to trach and take tube out on Mon
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course. Finished azithromycin yesterday.
   - Continue Vanco (day 13/14), aztreonam for (day13/14) day total course
   for GN coverage
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-20**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - renal team has signed off
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal as negative as possible given that patient is
   relatively euvolemic, may not be able to be diuresed much more.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - With improving renal function and normal phosphate, will consider
   stopping calcium acetate.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
   .
   # R hand swelling
   - U/S of R arm
    .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #DM II: Blood glucose has been low on insulin drip, high on insulin
   sliding scale
   - d/c Insulin drip and re-write for more aggressive sliding scale.
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: peripherals, Aline, IJ Central line
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother
   Disposition: pending improved respiratory status.
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A. 

Key findings from the progress note include:

1. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 50%. The patient's arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is 96%.

2. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, azithromycin, and aztreonam. Cultures have been negative, except for influenza virus.

3. The patient's renal function has improved, with an increasing urine output and decreasing creatinine levels. Muddy casts are present on urine sediment, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

4. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and insulin therapy has been adjusted accordingly.

5. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS/sepsis combined with fluid overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. The patient's improvement seems to be mostly due to good diuresis.

6. The patient is planned for tracheostomy placement once PEEP is lowered to 8 or less, as recommended by thoracic surgery. The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension presenting with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from influenza A. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been intubated. He has received broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medication for influenza. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is breathing well off of paralysis. However, he remains on ventilatory support due to his underlying condition. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS combined with sepsis, fluid overload, and possible bacterial pneumonia. His initial pulmonary function (P/F ratio) was below 200, but it has improved and is now within a non-ARDS range.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has had low-grade fevers overnight, and his white blood cell count is trending up. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are not covering for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) or yeast. There is a concern for possible yeast line infection or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, although blood cultures have been negative to date.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. He has completed courses of antibiotics, and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus."

   Assessment and Plan
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and possible bacterial
   pneumonia. p/F<200 initially, today is improving and outside of ARDS
   range and patient is breathing well off of paralysis. His improvement
   seems to be mostly due to very good diuresis.  Thoracic surgery
   consulted and are willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or
   lower. PEEP now 8. thoracic surgery aware, patient planned for OR
   Monday unless off ventilator by then.  Tolerating pressure support
   well. Patient became agitated off sedation, will need to wean sedation
   slowly as this is likely the major barrier to extubation.
   - Try to wean pressure support back to 8 so that can get trach on
   Monday; ENT will leave pre-op surgery recs in chart tomorrow.
   - Daily CXR
   -Will continue diuresis , check evening lytes and give acetazolamide if
   needed
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with low-grade fevers overnight, WBC
   count trending up. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not
   covering for VRE, yeast. Concern for possible yeast line infection vs.
   C diff. Line site looks good making concern for this slightly lower;
   blood cultures negative to date.
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   - consider starting fluconazole or VRE coverage
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course. Finished azithromycin yesterday.
   -Continue Vanco (day 13/14), aztreonam for (day13/14) day total course
   for GN coverage
   - Continue peramivir for total 10 days as patient not improving (done
   [**12-20**])
   - While on peramivir will need daily ECG and skin checks to monitor for
   toxicity.
   - f/u ID recs.
   .
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - renal team has signed off
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal as negative as possible given that patient is
   relatively euvolemic, may not be able to be diuresed much more.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - With improving renal function and normal phosphate, will consider
   stopping calcium acetate.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
    .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   Active issues:
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and
   possible bacterial pneumonia.  Thoracic surgery consulted and are
   willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or lower. Patient planned
   for OR Monday unless off ventilator by then.
   - Will try on PS today to see if we can wean him down and avoid a trach
   - If unable, TF
s stopped after midnight
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with low-grade fevers overnight, WBC
   count trending up. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics and we have
   no recent infxns for which we are treating. Has completed courses of
   Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo had been discussed.
   However, he has received full courses of these ABx and it seems
   reasonable to see how he does off of these now.
   - D/C all ABx today but with lower threshold to restart if continues to
   be febrile or worsens
   - Keeping in lines for now as he needs them, but would consider pulling
   if worsens
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  As above for
   ABx regimen
 has now completed Peramivir course, Azithro, and will d/c
   Vanc/Aztreonam today.
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - Already negative this morning so will hold Lasix gtt and see how he
   does through the day
   - Goal will be even for the day
   - Renal team has signed off
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs. Will need to calculate
   insulin requirements through today and increase Glargine, however,
   should probably do this after his TF
s have been restarted (holding
   tonight after midnight for possible trach tomorrow).
   Other stable issues:
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
   # R hand swelling
   - U/S of R arm
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.

   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure most likely
   ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and possible bacterial
   pneumonia. p/F<200 initially, today is improving and outside of ARDS
   range and patient is breathing well off of paralysis. His improvement
   seems to be mostly due to very good diuresis.  Thoracic surgery
   consulted and are willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or
   lower. Patient planned for OR Monday unless off ventilator by then.
   Tolerating pressure support well. Patient became agitated off sedation,
   will need to wean sedation slowly as this is likely the major barrier
   to extubation.
   - F/u Surgery/ENT? recs today and try to get PEEP <8 so that he can get
   trach on Monday
   - Daily CXR
   -Will continue diuresis , check evening lytes and give acetazolamide if
   needed
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with low-grade fevers overnight, WBC
   count trending up. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not
   covering for VRE, yeast. Concern for possible yeast line infection vs.
   C diff. Line site looks good making concern for this slightly lower;
   blood cultures negative to date.
   - will d/c lines if culture positive, however given that patient has
   acute need for lines will culture prior to line d/c
   - plan to trach and take tube out on Mon
   - continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  However,
   given the severity of his illness we will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 14 day course. Finished azithromycin yesterday.
   - With continued fevers and rising WBC count, will continue Vanc and
   Aztreonam for empiric coverage at this point.
   - Stopped peramivir; completed 10 day course
   - f/u ID recs.
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - renal team has signed off
   - Lasix gtt.  Goal will be even today with Lasix gtt continued.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while being diuresed.
   - With improving renal function and normal phosphate, will consider
   stopping calcium acetate.
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
   # R hand swelling
   - U/S of R arm
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   #DM II: Blood glucose has been low on insulin drip, high on insulin

- Respiratory failure: The patient is improving with good diuresis and tolerating pressure support well. The plan is to wean sedation slowly and aim for tracheostomy placement once PEEP is less than 8.

- Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has low-grade fevers overnight, with a WBC count trending up. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is concern for possible yeast line infection or C. diff. The plan is to monitor the situation, culture prior to line discontinuation, and continue to tracheostomy and remove the current tube on Monday.

- Pneumonia: The patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. He has completed his courses of antibiotics, and cultures have been negative except for influenza virus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for a total 14-day course. Azithromycin was stopped yesterday, and peramivir was stopped due to no improvement.

- Renal failure: The patient's urine output and creatinine have improved, with muddy casts on urine sediment indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The renal team has signed off, and the goal is to continue Lasix gtt. With improving renal function and normal"

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   Active issues:
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and
   possible bacterial pneumonia.  Thoracic surgery consulted and are
   willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or lower. Patient planned
   for OR Monday unless off ventilator by then.
   - Will try on PS today to see if we can wean him down and avoid a trach
   - If unable, TF
s stopped after midnight
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with low-grade fevers overnight, WBC
   count trending up. Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics and we have
   no recent infxns for which we are treating. Has completed courses of
   Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo had been discussed.
   However, he has received full courses of these ABx and it seems
   reasonable to see how he does off of these now.
   - D/C all ABx today but with lower threshold to restart if continues to
   be febrile or worsens
   - Keeping in lines for now as he needs them, but would consider pulling
   if worsens
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  As above for
   ABx regimen
 has now completed Peramivir course, Azithro, and will d/c
   Vanc/Aztreonam today.
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - Already negative this morning so will hold Lasix gtt and see how he
   does through the day
   - Goal will be even for the day
   - Renal team has signed off
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs. Will need to calculate
   insulin requirements through today and increase Glargine, however,
   should probably do this after his TF
s have been restarted (holding
   tonight after midnight for possible trach tomorrow).
   Other stable issues:
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
   # R hand swelling
   - U/S of R arm
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: peripherals, Aline, IJ Central line
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily
   Disposition: pending improved respiratory status.
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including fever, tachycardia, rash, renal failure, hyperglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and airway obstruction. Active issues include respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, pneumonia, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and sedation. He is expected to undergo a tracheostomy if his PEEP level does not decrease to 8 or lower. The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and normal renal function tests. Imaging studies reveal a slight worsening of lung infiltrates but overall improvement. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-induced lung injury, nosocomial infections, and complications related to prolonged bed rest and immobility."

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   Active issues:
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid overload and
   possible bacterial pneumonia.  Thoracic surgery consulted and are
   willing to do trach placement once PEEP is 8 or lower. Patient planned
   for OR Monday unless off ventilator by then.
   - Trach and PEG by interventional pulmonology this morning.
   - If unable, TF
s stopped after midnight
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.1 last night, pan-cultured, but no
   clear source.  Currently off of antibiotics.
   Patient with low-grade fevers overnight, WBC count trending up.
   Currently on broad spectrum antibiotics and we have no recent infxns
   for which we are treating. Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir,
   and continuing Vanc/Aztreo had been discussed. However, he has received
   full courses of these ABx and it seems reasonable to see how he does
   off of these now.
   - D/C all ABx today but with lower threshold to restart if continues to
   be febrile or worsens
   - Keeping in lines for now as he needs them, but would consider pulling
   if worsens
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  As above for
   ABx regimen
 has now completed Peramivir course, Azithro, and will d/c
   Vanc/Aztreonam today.
   #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - Already negative this morning so will hold Lasix gtt and see how he
   does through the day
   - Goal will be even for the day
   - Renal team has signed off
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs. Will need to calculate
   insulin requirements through today and increase Glargine, however,
   should probably do this after his TF
s have been restarted (holding
   tonight after midnight for possible trach tomorrow).
   Other stable issues:
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
   # R hand swelling
   - U/S of R arm
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: peripherals, Aline, IJ Central line
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily
   Disposition: pending improved respiratory status.
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1. The patient has multiple ongoing medical issues including respiratory failure due to ARDS and sepsis combined with fluid overload and possible bacterial pneumonia, fevers/leukocytosis, pneumonia, renal failure, and hyperglycemia. The patient has completed courses of antibiotics, and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, propofol, famotidine, heparin, and Glargine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1. The patient had planned thoracic surgery for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), but due to respiratory failure, it was postponed. He underwent tracheostomy and PEG successfully. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS/sepsis combined with fluid overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. He required mechanical ventilation and received courses of antibiotics, but his condition improved.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient had fevers and leukocytosis, but no clear source was identified. He completed courses of Azithromycin, Peramivir, and Vancomycin/Aztreonam, and antibiotics were discontinued.
3. Pneumonia: The patient had severe influenza with ARDS and possible bacterial superinfection. He completed his antibiotic courses, and cultures were negative except for influenza virus. Antibiotics were stopped.
4. Renal Failure: The patient had renal failure with improving urine output and creatinine. He had muddy casts on urine sediment, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Lasix was stopped, and the goal was to maintain even urine output.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes management was adjusted, switching from"

   Imaging: [**12-21**] CXR yesterday looks worse in the R
   [**12-21**] EMG
   IMPRESSION:
   Abnormal, technically-limited study. There is electrophysiologic
   evidence for
   a moderate sensorimotor polyneuropathy with predominantly axonal
   features.
   Although a diagnosis of critical-illness polyneuropathy is the most
   likely
   explanation in this clinical context, the findings could also be
   explained by
   the patient's underlying diabetes. The electrophysiologic abnormalities
   which
   could be construed as consistent with primary demyelination (absent F
   responses and prolonged distal CMAP durations) are more likely the
   result of
   technical factors. Disorders of the neuromuscular junction and
   myopathic
   processes could not be assessed due to technical limitations and lack
   of
   patient cooperation.

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   Active issues:
   # Respiratory failure: Originially ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia.  Pt has now been trach'ed
   but didn't get PEG due to problems with EGD scope, so planning to go
   today. Continues now on CPAP 10/5, 50%.
   - Tomorrow consider trach mask trials, but will defer for now until
   after PEG placed
   - To get PEG today
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.1 two nights ago, pan-cultured,
   but no clear source and Cx's continue to be negative. Budding yeast in
   most recent sputum likely OP flora.  Currently off of antibiotics, and
   given lack of source we will not start any medications at this time.
   Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo
   had been discussed. However, he has received full courses of these ABx
   and it seems reasonable to see how he does off of these now.
   - D/C all ABx yesterday but with lower threshold to restart if
   continues to be febrile or worsens
   - Would more strongly pulling R IJ and if continues to have IV needs,
   consider a PICC
   # Acute drop in Hct: Did have a minor surgery yesterday but wouldn't
   think pt would lose a whole unit of blood.
   - Repeat Hct later this evening and continues to go down will transfuse
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  Stopped
   antibiotics yesterday.
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - Off of lasix gtt
   - Goal will be even for the day
   - Renal team has signed off
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs.
   - Will calculate insulin requirements once pt is taking PO. Not today,
   as pt currently NPO for PEG today
   # Critical illness myopathy:
    - Need to address underlying illness and once pt wakes up a little
   more, will consult PT
   [**Name (NI) **] stable issues:
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS caused by influenza A/H1N1. The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and removal of an orogastric (OG) tube. He has also received various medications and treatments for his conditions.

From the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had ARDS, which has led to respiratory failure. Although he has been tracheostomized, he still requires respiratory support on CPAP mode with a FiO2 of 50%. There are plans to consider tracheostomy mask trials after the placement of PEG.
2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient had fevers and leukocytosis in the past, but cultures have been negative so far. Budding yeast in the sputum is likely due to oropharyngeal flora. Antibiotics have been discontinued for now, but there is a lower threshold to restart them if the patient continues to be febrile or worsens.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's urine output and creatinine levels have improved, but he still has muddy casts on the urine sediment, indicating a component of"

   IMPRESSION:
   Abnormal, technically-limited study. There is electrophysiologic
   evidence for
   a moderate sensorimotor polyneuropathy with predominantly axonal
   features.
   Although a diagnosis of critical-illness polyneuropathy is the most
   likely
   explanation in this clinical context, the findings could also be
   explained by
   the patient's underlying diabetes. The electrophysiologic abnormalities
   which
   could be construed as consistent with primary demyelination (absent F
   responses and prolonged distal CMAP durations) are more likely the
   result of
   technical factors. Disorders of the neuromuscular junction and
   myopathic
   processes could not be assessed due to technical limitations and lack
   of
   patient cooperation.

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   Active issues:
   # Respiratory failure: Originially ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia.  Pt has now been trach'ed
   but didn't get PEG due to problems with EGD scope, so planning to go
   today. Continues now on CPAP 10/5, 50%.
   - Tomorrow consider trach mask trials, but will defer for now until
   after PEG placed
   - To get PEG today
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.1 two nights ago, pan-cultured,
   but no clear source and Cx's continue to be negative. Budding yeast in
   most recent sputum likely OP flora.  Currently off of antibiotics, and
   given lack of source we will not start any medications at this time.
   Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo
   had been discussed. However, he has received full courses of these ABx
   and it seems reasonable to see how he does off of these now.
   - D/C all ABx yesterday but with lower threshold to restart if
   continues to be febrile or worsens. Would start with covering for gram
   negative per ID recs
   - His R IJ CVL does look a little erythematous, and should be pulled.
   Will get 2^nd PIV access today if possible and if so, can likely pull
   CVL as he doesn
t need it anymore currently
   # Acute drop in Hct: Did have a minor surgery yesterday but wouldn't
   think pt would lose a whole unit of blood.
   - Repeat Hct later this evening and continues to go down will transfuse
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs.
   - Will calculate insulin requirements once pt has taken a full day of
   nutrition either by PEG or by TF, in order to accurately calculate
   insulin requirements. Not today, as pt currently NPO for PEG today.
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - Consult PT today
   Other stable issues:
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  Stopped
   antibiotics yesterday.
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - Off of lasix gtt
   - Goal will be even for the day
   - Renal team has signed off
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
   # R hand swelling

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute lung injury (ALI) due to influenza A/H1N1.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including:

1. Respiratory failure: Initially due to ARDS/sepsis combined with fluid overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. The patient has now been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient was febrile to 101.1 degrees two nights ago, and cultures were taken but came back negative. Budding yeast in the most recent sputum is likely OP flora. The antibiotics have been discontinued for now.

3. Acute drop in hematocrit (Hct): There was a minor surgery yesterday, but it is unlikely that the patient would lose a whole unit of blood. Repeat Hct later this evening, and if it continues to go down, transfuse.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with Influenza PNA and ARDS, who underwent tracheostomy yesterday. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has been weaned off antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.2°F, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/66 to 147/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is on CPAP/PSV mode with set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 10, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and an ABG result indicating a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 32, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 156.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with left pupil not reactive. The patient has right lower extremity edema of 1+ and left lower extremity edema of 1+. His cardiovascular system is normal, and he has rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination shows the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and responds not assessed. 

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 13.2 K/uL, Hct of 26.2, Plt of 699, Cr of 1.2, TCO2 of 29, Glucose levels fluctuating between 65 and 159 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range. Imaging reveals critical illness polyneuropathy.

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   .
   # New Respiratory failure: Originially ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia.  Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  Patient experienced distress in setting of receiving 400ml of
   IVF after being NPO for greater than 24 hours.  Vents settings adjusted
   and patient sedated.  Repeated CXR which showed pulm edema and gave
   lasix.  Bed in reverse T.  Patient improved saturation (100%FiO2 and 12
   of PEEP to 50% and 5 PEEP) but is still agitated, tachypneic, and
   tachycardic.   Patient could have VAP esp in setting of recent trach
   placement and fever spike this morning.
   - Restart lasix drip
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine
   - Restart antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro for  MRSA and double
   pseudomonas coverage if spikes again or if culture begin to grow
   something.
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Daily CXR
   - increase sedation- restart fentanyl and propofol drip.
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.4 this morning.  Pan-cultured, but
   no clear source and Cx's negative this morning.  Had been spiking
   fevers recently despite clinical improvement.  Righ IJ was pulled last
   night and tip will be cultured.  Currently off of antibiotics, and
   given lack of source we will not start any medications at this time.
   Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo
   had been discussed. However, he has received full courses of these ABx
   and it seems reasonable to see how he does off of these now.
   - D/C all ABx 2days ago.  Will restart if decompensates or if cultures
   are revealing.   Would start with covering for gram negative per ID
   recs
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip
   .
   # Acute drop in Hct: Did have a minor surgery yesterday but wouldn't
   think pt would lose a whole unit of blood.  Repeat Hcts have been
   stable.  Will continue to follow and transfuse if below 25 so that PEG
   can be placed
   - q12 hour Hct
   -transfuse if below 25
    .
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs.
   - Will calculate insulin requirements once pt has taken a full day of
   nutrition either by PEG or by TF, in order to accurately calculate
   insulin requirements. Not today, as pt currently NPO for PEG today.
   .
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - Consult PT today
   .
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  Has
   really improved with treatment and improvement of ARDS
   - Off of lasix gtt; will restart today
   - Renal team has signed off
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
 to get a
   PEG today
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: peripherals, Aline, IJ Central line pulled, will do so after
   2nd PIV is placed
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily
   Disposition: pending improved respiratory status.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A/H1N1. 

The patient's recent events include experiencing desaturation after receiving IV fluids, tachypnea, tachycardia, and alertness with anxiety. He was put back on CMV/Assist and had to increase PEEP to 12 and FiO2 to 100% to stabilize his oxygen saturation. The patient was also placed in reverse Trendelenburg position, given lasix 80, fentanyl boluses, and versed boluses for sedation. A new chest X-ray showed marked pulmonary edema, and his ventilator settings were able to be weaned to PEEP 5 and FiO2 50%. However, the patient remained tachycardic and tachypneic.

The patient also had a fever of 101.4 this morning and was pan-cultured with new chest X-ray. He has been off sedating drips for two days and had been doing well on pressure support. The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.2, hematocrit (Hct) of 26.2, platelet count (Plt) of 955, and blood glucose levels ranging from 65 to 116 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include restarting lasix drip, following up with cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, restarting antibiotics for MRSA and double coverage for pseudomonas, administering nebulizer treatments and suctioning, and obtaining daily chest X-rays. The patient is also being considered for placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sepsis, acute kidney injury (AKI), critical illness myopathy, and gastrointestinal issues such as bowel distention and constipation due to immobilization and paralytic ileus.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, blood cultures, urine output, and renal function. Regular communication with the family and multidisciplinary collaboration will be necessary to manage the patient's complex medical condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   .
   # New Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia.  Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  Patient experienced distress in setting of receiving 400ml of
   IVF after being NPO for greater than 24 hours.  Vents settings adjusted
   and patient sedated.  Repeated CXR which showed pulmonary edema and
   gave lasix.  Bed in reverse T.  Patient improved saturation (100%FiO2
   and 12 of PEEP to 50% and 5 PEEP) but is still agitated, tachypneic,
   and tachycardic.   Patient could have VAP esp in setting of recent
   trach placement and fever spike this morning.
   - Restart lasix drip
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine
   - Restart antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro for  MRSA and double
   pseudomonas coverage if spikes again or if culture begin to grow
   something.
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Daily CXR
   - Increase sedation- restart fentanyl and propofol drip.
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.4 this morning.  Pan-cultured, but
   no clear source and Cx's negative this morning.  Had been spiking
   fevers recently despite clinical improvement.  Righ IJ was pulled last
   night and tip will be cultured.  Currently off of antibiotics, and
   given lack of source we will not start any medications at this time.
   Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo
   had been discussed. However, he has received full courses of these ABx
   and it seems reasonable to see how he does off of these now.
   - D/C all ABx 2days ago.  Will restart if decompensates or if cultures
   are revealing.   Would start with covering for gram negative per ID
   recs
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip
   .
   # Acute drop in Hct: Did have a minor surgery yesterday but wouldn't
   think pt would lose a whole unit of blood.  Repeat Hcts have been
   stable.  Will continue to follow and transfuse if below 25 so that PEG
   can be placed
   - q12 hour Hct
   -transfuse if below 25
    .
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs.
   - Will calculate insulin requirements once pt has taken a full day of
   nutrition either by PEG or by TF, in order to accurately calculate
   insulin requirements. Not today, as pt currently NPO for PEG today.
   .
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - Consult PT today
   .
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  Has
   really improved with treatment and improvement of ARDS
   - Off of lasix gtt; will restart today
   - Renal team has signed off
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was  negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention
   - Bowel regimen.
   -continue rectal tubes
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
 to get a
   PEG today
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: peripherals, A-line, IJ Central line pulled, will do so after
   2nd PIV is placed
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily
   Disposition: pending improved respiratory status.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A/H1N1. 

The patient experienced an acute event where he desaturated to 80% after receiving 400ml of IV fluid while being NPO for over 24 hours. This led to an increase in heart rate (tachycardia) and respiratory rate (tachypnea). The patient was put back on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV)/Assist and had to increase the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 12 and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to 100% to maintain oxygen saturation. 

The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position, given lasix 80, and sedated with fentanyl and versed boluses. A chest X-ray showed marked pulmonary edema. The patient's ventilator settings were later weaned to PEEP 5 and FiO2 50%, but he remains agitated, tachypneic, and tachycardic. 

The patient also has a fever of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit this morning and is pan-cultured. There are no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 12/20 at 8:06 AM and aztreonam on 12/20 at 9"

   Chief Complaint: ARDS
   24 Hour Events:
   At around midnight, patient started desaturating in the setting of
   getting 400ml of IVF after being NPO for >24hours.  His saturation went
   to 80%, he was tachypneic to 30-40 and tachycardic to 130's.  Was alert
   and anxious.  He was put back on CMV/Assist and had to put PEEP to 12
   and FiO2 to 100% to get O2 sats up.
   Patient put in reverse Trendelenberg, lasix 80 was given, fentanyl
   boluses and versed boluses were given for sedation.  CXR showed marked
   pulmonary edema.  His settings were able to be weaned to PEEP 5 and
   FiO2 50% this morning.  Still tachycardic and tachypneic.
   Had a fever to 101.4 this morning and was pan-cultured with new CXR
   taken

   Assessment and Plan
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   .
   # New Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  Patient experienced distress in setting of receiving 400ml of
   IVF after being NPO for greater than 24 hours.  Vent settings adjusted
   and patient sedated.  Repeated CXR which showed pulmonary edema and
   gave lasix.  Bed in reverse Trendelenberg.  Patient improved saturation
   (100%FiO2 and 12 of PEEP to 50% and 5 PEEP) but is still agitated,
   tachypneic, and tachycardic.   Patient could have VAP especially in
   setting of recent trach placement and fever spike this morning.
   - Hold Lasix for now, pursue infectious source and restart diuresis
   possibly in the future.
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine
   - Restart antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro for MRSA and double
   pseudomonas coverage
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Daily CXR
   - Sedation: bolus sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.
   - mini-BAL
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.4 this morning.  Pan-cultured, but
   no clear source and Cx's negative this morning.  Had been spiking
   fevers recently despite clinical improvement.  Right IJ was pulled last
   night and tip will be cultured.  Currently off of antibiotics, and
   given lack of source we will not start any medications at this time.
   Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo
   had been discussed. However, he had  received full courses of these ABx
   and it seemed reasonable to see how he did off of these; but now, given
   fever, worsening respiratory status, and lower BP, want to start
   empiric coverage.
   - Start antibiotics for empiric coverage = start vancomycin, cefepime,
   ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip
   .
   # Acute drop in Hct: Did have a minor surgery yesterday but wouldn't
   think pt would lose a whole unit of blood.  Repeat Hcts have been
   stable.  Will continue to follow and transfuse if below 25 so that PEG
   can be placed.
   - q12 hour Hct
   -transfuse if below 25
    .
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs.
   - Will calculate insulin requirements once pt has taken a full day of
   nutrition either by PEG or by TF, in order to accurately calculate
   insulin requirements. Not today, as pt currently NPO for PEG today.
   SSI.
   .
   #PEG placement: Surgery and GI have deferred placement of PEG to IR b/c
   of h/o volvulus, low albumin, and low Hcts.  IR so far has agreed to do
   procedure, but will wait until clinically improves.
   - Reschedule gastrostomy w/ IR when improves clinically.
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - Consult PT today
   .
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  Has
   really improved with treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Off of lasix gtt; consider Lasix later today pending I
s and O
   - Renal team has signed off
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started
   previously on Lopressor; however now with borderline blood pressure.
   - Discontinue Lopressor to see if treating infection improves this.
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention.
   - Bowel regimen.
   -Continue rectal tube
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds. Consider PEG
   placement soon but not today (by IR; not by GI or surgery). NG tube
   placement today.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 2 peripherals, A-line (might need to re-wire today), IJ Central
   line pulled.
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily.
   Disposition: Pending improved respiratory status.
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension presenting with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1. He has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has developed multiple medical complications.

1. New Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS/sepsis combined with fluid overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. His tracheostomy tube was placed, and he was doing well on pressure support. However, he experienced distress after receiving IV fluids, leading to adjustments in ventilator settings and sedation. His recent CXR showed pulmonary edema, and he was given Lasix. Despite improving oxygen saturation, he remains agitated, tachypneic, and tachycardic. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to recent tracheostomy placement and fever spike this morning. The plan is to hold Lasix for now, pursue infectious sources, restart diuresis possibly in the future, follow up with cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, restart antibiotics for MRSA and double coverage for pseudomonas, provide nebulizer treatments and suctioning, and perform daily CXRs.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has been febrile to 101.4 degrees this morning. He has been pan-cultured, but no clear source has been identified and Cx's were negative this"

   to 80%, he was tachypneic to 30-40 and tachycardic to 130's.  Was alert
   and anxious.  He was put back on CMV/Assist and had to put PEEP to 12
   and FiO2 to 100% to get sats up.
   Patient put in reverse trendelenberg, lasix 80 was given, fentanyl
   boluses and versed boluses were given for sedation.  CXR showed marked
   pulm edema.  His settings were able to be weaned to PEEP 5 abd FiO2
   50%.  Still tachycardic and tachypneic.
   Had a fever to 101.4 this morning and was pan-cultured with new CXR.

   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia.  Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  Patient experienced distress in setting of receiving IVF
   after
   - Tomorrow consider trach mask trials, but will defer for now until
   after PEG placed
   - To get PEG today
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.1 two nights ago, pan-cultured,
   but no clear source and Cx's continue to be negative. Budding yeast in
   most recent sputum likely OP flora.  Currently off of antibiotics, and
   given lack of source we will not start any medications at this time.
   Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo
   had been discussed. However, he has received full courses of these ABx
   and it seems reasonable to see how he does off of these now.
   - D/C all ABx yesterday but with lower threshold to restart if
   continues to be febrile or worsens. Would start with covering for gram
   negative per ID recs
   - His R IJ CVL does look a little erythematous, and should be pulled.
   Will get 2nd PIV access today if possible and if so, can likely pull
   CVL as he doesn
t need it anymore currently
   # Acute drop in Hct: Did have a minor surgery yesterday but wouldn't
   think pt would lose a whole unit of blood.
   - Repeat Hct later this evening and continues to go down will transfuse
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs.
   - Will calculate insulin requirements once pt has taken a full day of
   nutrition either by PEG or by TF, in order to accurately calculate
   insulin requirements. Not today, as pt currently NPO for PEG today.
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - Consult PT today
   Other stable issues:
   # Pneumonia: Patient has severe influenza with ARDS and possible
   bacterial superinfection.  He has completed his courses of antibiotics,
   and cultures have been negative besides influenza virus.  Stopped
   antibiotics yesterday.
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.
   - Off of lasix gtt
   - Goal will be even for the day
   - Renal team has signed off
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started on
   Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID. Will not increase as patient tolerates lasix
   drip better when blood pressure slightly increased. If patient is
   tachycardic or hypertensive later in the day with decreased sedation,
   will increase this as needed.
   -Lopressor 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently weaned to assist-control ventilation with a tracheostomy tube in place. He has been extubated twice but required reintubation due to desaturation after receiving intravenous fluids.

The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, with no clear source identified. Cultures have been negative, except for budding yeast in the most recent sputum sample, which is likely oral flora. Antibiotics have been completed, and the decision has been made not to start any additional medications at this time.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has acutely dropped, and a repeat test will be performed later in the evening. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and insulin requirements need to be calculated once he takes a full day of nutrition either by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or through the feeding tube.

The patient is also diagnosed with critical illness myopathy and is awaiting a physical therapy consultation. Other stable issues include pneumonia, renal failure with muddy casts indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN), eye redness and discharge, tachycardia, rash, abdominal distension, and right hand swelling.

   Assessment and Plan
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   .
   # New Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  Patient experienced distress in setting of receiving 400ml of
   IVF after being NPO for greater than 24 hours.  Vent settings adjusted
   and patient sedated.  Repeated CXR which showed pulmonary edema and
   gave lasix.  Bed in reverse Trendelenberg.  Patient improved saturation
   (100%FiO2 and 12 of PEEP to 50% and 5 PEEP) but is still agitated,
   tachypneic, and tachycardic.   Patient could have VAP especially in
   setting of recent trach placement and fever spike this morning.
   - Consider Lasix this afternoon, pending I
s and O
s trend
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine
   - Restart antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro for MRSA and double
   pseudomonas coverage
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Daily CXR
   - Sedation: bolus sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.4 this morning.  Pan-cultured, but
   no clear source and Cx's negative this morning.  Had been spiking
   fevers recently despite clinical improvement.  Right IJ was pulled last
   night and tip will be cultured.  Currently off of antibiotics, and
   given lack of source we will not start any medications at this time.
   Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo
   had been discussed. However, he had  received full courses of these ABx
   and it seemed reasonable to see how he did off of these; but now, given
   fever, worsening respiratory status, and lower BP, want to start
   empiric coverage.
   - Start antibiotics for empiric coverage = start vancomycin, cefepime,
   ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip
   .
   # Acute drop in Hct: Did have a minor surgery yesterday but wouldn't
   think pt would lose a whole unit of blood.  Repeat Hcts have been
   stable.  Will continue to follow and transfuse if below 25 so that PEG
   can be placed.
   - q12 hour Hct
   -transfuse if below 25
    .
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs.
   - Will calculate insulin requirements once pt has taken a full day of
   nutrition either by PEG or by TF, in order to accurately calculate
   insulin requirements. Not today, as pt currently NPO for PEG today.
   SSI.
   .
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - Consult PT today
   .
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  Has
   really improved with treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Off of lasix gtt; consider Lasix later today pending I
s and O
   - Renal team has signed off
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely multifocal atrial tachycardia. Patient started
   previously on Lopressor; however now with borderline blood pressure.
   - Discontinue Lopressor
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention.
   - Bowel regimen.
   -Continue rectal tube
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds. Consider PEG
   placement soon but not today (by IR; not by GI or surgery). NG tube
   placement today.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 2 peripherals, A-line (might need to re-wire today), IJ Central
   line pulled.
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily.
   Disposition: Pending improved respiratory status.
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension presenting with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1. The patient has experienced multiple medical complications including new respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, acute drop in hemoglobin (Hct), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), critical illness myopathy, renal failure, eye redness and discharge, tachycardia, rash, abdominal distension, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and fecal incontinence (FEN). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), acute kidney injury (AKI), pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes restarting antibiotics for MRSA and double coverage for pseudomonas, daily chest X-rays, nebulizer treatments, suctioning, and sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure of 108/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. Imaging shows diffuse patchiness likely due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, or infection."

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.9 thousand cells per microliter, normal hemoglobin level of 8.7 grams per deciliter, elevated platelet count of 955 thousand cells per microliter, and slightly elevated blood glucose level of 116 milligrams per deciliter. Other lab values including creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and liver enzymes are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is sedated and unresponsive, with very rhonchi in the lungs, regular rapid heart rate, distended abdomen, and mild edema in the extremities.

The patient's medical complications and potential risks include:

   .
   # New Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  Patient experienced distress in setting of receiving 400ml of
   IVF after being NPO for greater than 24 hours.  Vent settings adjusted
   and patient sedated.  Repeated CXR which showed pulmonary edema and
   gave lasix.  Bed in reverse Trendelenberg.  Patient improved saturation
   (100%FiO2 and 12 of PEEP to 50% and 5 PEEP) but is still agitated,
   tachypneic, and tachycardic.   Patient could have VAP especially in
   setting of recent trach placement and fever spike this morning.
   - Hold Lasix for now, pursue infectious source and restart diuresis
   possibly in the future; does not clinically appear volume overloaded
   today
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, f/u mini-BAL
   - Continue antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro (all 3 started on
   [**12-23**]) for MRSA and double pseudomonas coverage
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Sedation: d/c Fentanyl and versed. Start methadone 5mg PO q8h.
   - Attempt trach-mask trial today
   - Wean down FiO2
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.4 this morning.  Pan-cultured, but
   no clear source and Cx's negative this morning.  Had been spiking
   fevers recently despite clinical improvement.  Right IJ was pulled last
   night and tip will be cultured.  Currently off of antibiotics, and
   given lack of source we will not start any medications at this time.
   Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo
   had been discussed. However, he had  received full courses of these ABx
   and it seemed reasonable to see how he did off of these; but now, given
   fever, worsening respiratory status, and lower BP, want to start
   empiric coverage.
   - Continue antibiotics for empiric coverage = vancomycin, cefepime,
   ciprofloxacin (started all 3 on [**12-23**])
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip and mini-BAL
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status. Tolerating HR.
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Anemia: Did have a minor surgery yesterday but wouldn't think pt
   would lose a whole unit of blood.  Repeat Hcts have been stable.  Will
   continue to follow and transfuse if below 25 so that PEG can be placed.
   - q12 hour Hct
   -transfuse if below 25
   .
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs; now on [**Month/Year (2) **]
   - Re-calculate insulin requirements today
 increase glargine to 45U
   qhs.
   .
   #PEG placement: Dobhoff placed yesterday, and is now more stable
   clinically.  Surgery and GI have deferred placement of PEG to IR b/c of
   h/o volvulus, low albumin, and low Hcts.  IR so far has agreed to do
   procedure, but will wait until clinically improves.
   - Contact IR
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1851**] with Dobhoff for now
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
   .
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  Has
   really improved with treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Off of lasix gtt; consider Lasix later today pending I
s and O
   - Renal team has signed off
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   # Rash: Rash seems to be improving now that zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of
   DRESS.  Has some signs of folliculitis today
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor, especially w/ starting cefepime.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention.
   - Bowel regimen.
   -Continue rectal tube
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds. Consider PEG
   placement soon but not today (by IR; not by GI or surgery). NG tube in
   place.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 2 peripherals, A-line (might need to re-wire today), IJ Central
   line pulled. Place order for PICC to be placed tomorrow, for antibiotic
   delivery.
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily.
   Disposition: Pending improved respiratory status.
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A/H1N1. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, fever, tachycardia, rash, renal failure, hyperglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. The patient has been on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, sedatives, and insulin. He has also undergone tracheostomy placement and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent tracheostomy placement and prolonged mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures is important.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever spikes, leukocytosis, and worsening respiratory status indicate a possible ongoing infection. Empiric antibiotic coverage should be continued, and cultures should be followed up.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's initial presentation included ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued. Monitoring of symptoms and repeat imaging may be necessary.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved, but close monitoring"

   .
   # New Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  This morning he is tachypneic and alkalotic.  This does not
   change with decreasing pressure support.  We will tolerate this for
   now, and attempt to have more uniform sedation with long-acting
   methadone rather than bolusing fentanyl once an hour.
   - Start methadone 10mg TID
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, f/u mini-BAL
   - Continue antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro (all 3 started on
   [**12-23**]) for MRSA and double pseudomonas coverage
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Attempt trach-mask trial today
   - Wean down FiO2
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia.  We will continue all antibiotics
   for now and consider narrowing to single pseudomonal coverage if he
   remains afebrile.
   - Continue antibiotics for empiric coverage = vancomycin, cefepime,
   ciprofloxacin (started all 3 on [**12-23**])
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip and mini-BAL
   .
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs; now on [**Month/Year (2) **]
   - Re-calculate insulin requirements today
 increase glargine to 45U
   qhs.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status. Today he is still tachycardic to the low 100s,
   but we will tolerate that for the time being.
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  Will continue to monitor daily.
   -transfuse if below 21
   .
   #PEG placement: Dobhoff placed yesterday, and is now more stable
   clinically.  Surgery and GI have deferred placement of PEG to IR b/c of
   h/o volvulus, low albumin, and low Hcts.  IR so far has agreed to do
   procedure, but will wait until clinically improves.
   - Contact IR
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1851**] with Dobhoff for now
   .
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
   .
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Has really improved with
   treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Off of lasix gtt; consider Lasix later today pending I
s and O
   - Renal team has signed off
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor, especially w/ starting cefepime.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Had poor motility with paralysis causing bowel
   distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds. Patient has had some
   loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that he is not infected
   given that he is on a large number of antibiotics and was negative X3.
   Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving his distention.
   - Bowel regimen.
   - Continue rectal tube
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds. PEG to be
   placed by IR. Dobhoff in place for now.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 2 peripherals, A-line (might need to re-wire today). Placed
   order for PICC to be placed tomorrow, for antibiotic delivery.
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily.
   Disposition: Pending improved respiratory status.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory alkalosis, pulmonary edema, fever, tachycardia, rash, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and inability to protect airway.

The patient's current status is as follows:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been doing well on pressure support but is now tachypneic and alkalotic. Sedation will be attempted with long-acting methadone instead of bolusing fentanyl. Tracheostomy trial will be attempted today.
2. Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with antibiotics (vanc, cipro, and cefepime) and central venous line removal. Antibiotics will be continued for now, considering narrowing to single pseudomonal coverage if the patient remains afebrile.
3. DM2: The patient was previously on insulin gtt but switched to Glargine 40U qhs and short-acting insulin (SSI). Glargine will be increased to 45U qhs.
4. Tachycardia: The patient is still tachycardic to the low 100s, but"

   Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure/low-grade fevers
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spiked this morning at 0430 so pan-cultured him and CXR
   - Dobhoff placed --> TF's Novasource renal 25cc/hr started around 5pm,
   no residuals.
   - Mini BAL done, Cdiff collected
   - Once taking a day of TF's, will need insulin requirements calculated
   - F/u IJ tip and Cx's: negative so far
   - Stopped Lopressor
   - Restarted Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro due to fevers
   - Bolusing sedation today (no gtt) --> got Fent/Versed with Dobhoff at
   3pm, nothing since, comfortable.
   - Keep eye on AG
   - 2pm ABG: 7.51/27/93/22 --> good tidal volumes, tachypneic --> weaning

   # New Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  Patient experienced distress in setting of receiving 400ml of
   IVF after being NPO for greater than 24 hours.  Vent settings adjusted
   and patient sedated.  Repeated CXR which showed pulmonary edema and
   gave lasix.  Bed in reverse Trendelenberg.  Patient improved saturation
   (100%FiO2 and 12 of PEEP to 50% and 5 PEEP) but is still agitated,
   tachypneic, and tachycardic.   Patient could have VAP especially in
   setting of recent trach placement and fever spike this morning.
   - Hold Lasix for now, pursue infectious source and restart diuresis
   possibly in the future.
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine
   - Restart antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro for MRSA and double
   pseudomonas coverage
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Daily CXR
   - Sedation: bolus sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.
   - mini-BAL
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile to 101.4 this morning.  Pan-cultured, but
   no clear source and Cx's negative this morning.  Had been spiking
   fevers recently despite clinical improvement.  Right IJ was pulled last
   night and tip will be cultured.  Currently off of antibiotics, and
   given lack of source we will not start any medications at this time.
   Has completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, and continuing Vanc/Aztreo
   had been discussed. However, he had  received full courses of these ABx
   and it seemed reasonable to see how he did off of these; but now, given
   fever, worsening respiratory status, and lower BP, want to start
   empiric coverage.
   - Start antibiotics for empiric coverage = start vancomycin, cefepime,
   ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; yesterday held
   for tenuous clinical status.
   - restart metoprolol
   .
   # Anemia: Did have a minor surgery yesterday but wouldn't think pt
   would lose a whole unit of blood.  Repeat Hcts have been stable.  Will
   continue to follow and transfuse if below 25 so that PEG can be placed.
   - q12 hour Hct

   #PEG placement: Dobhoff placed yesterday, and is now more stable
   clinically.  Should be able to
   Surgery and GI have deferred placement of PEG to IR b/c of h/o
   volvulus, low albumin, and low Hcts.  IR so far has agreed to do
   procedure, but will wait until clinically improves.
   - Reschedule gastrostomy w/ IR when improves clinically.
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - Consult PT today

   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Has muddy
   casts on urine sediment per renal, seems to have component of ATN.  Has
   really improved with treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Off of lasix gtt; consider Lasix later today pending I

   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.

   #Abdominal distension: Seems to have poor motility with paralysis that
   leads to increasing bowel distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds.
   Patient has had some loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that
   he is not infected given that he is on a large number of antibiotics
   and was negative X3.  Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving
   his distention.
   - Bowel regimen.
   -Continue rectal tube

   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds. Consider PEG
   placement soon but not today (by IR; not by GI or surgery). NG tube
   placement today.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen

   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily.
   Disposition: Pending improved respiratory status.
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had ARDS/sepsis combined with fluid overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient developed pulmonary edema, as evidenced by the chest X-ray. Lasix was given, and the patient's saturation improved after adjusting the ventilator settings.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP, especially considering recent tracheostomy placement and fever spike this morning.

4. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient had fevers up to 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit and leukocytosis. Cultures were obtained, but no clear source was identified, and initial cultures were negative. Antibiotics were restarted due to worsening respiratory status and lower blood pressure.

5. Tachycardia: The patient had multifocal atrial tachycardia. Metoprolol was previously started but held due to tenuous clinical status.

6. Anemia: The patient had minor surgery yesterday, but it is unclear why he lost a whole unit of blood. Repeat Hcts have been stable, and transfusion is recommended"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with Down syndrome who is admitted to the ICU with ARDS due to Influenza pneumonia. He has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's fever curve is trending down, but he remains tachypneic. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/71 mmHg to 100/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and attentive with good air entry bilaterally on lung auscultation. He has right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and hyperglycemia. The patient is diagnosed with respiratory alkalosis, pulmonary edema, fever, tachycardia, rash, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, ARDS, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and airway protection issues. The plan includes weaning down from mechanical ventilation, continuation of antibiotics, management of agitation and withdrawal symptoms with methadone, optimization of diabetes management, placement of a PIC line and PEG, and provision of ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and tachypnea pose"

   Microbiology: All cultures NTD; some PMN in sputum
   Assessment and Plan
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  This morning he is tachypneic and alkalotic.  This does not
   change with decreasing pressure support.  We will tolerate this for
   now, and attempt to have more uniform sedation with long-acting
   methadone rather than bolusing fentanyl once an hour.
   - Start methadone 10mg TID
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, f/u mini-BAL
   - Continue antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro (all 3 started on
   [**12-23**]) for MRSA and double pseudomonas coverage
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Attempt trach-mask trial today
   - Wean down FiO2
   - 2L diuresis
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia.  We will continue all antibiotics
   for now and consider narrowing to single pseudomonal coverage if he
   remains afebrile.
   - Continue antibiotics for empiric coverage = vancomycin, cefepime,
   ciprofloxacin (started all 3 on [**12-23**])
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip and mini-BAL
   .
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs; now on tubefeeds
   - Re-calculate insulin requirements today
 increased glargine to 45U
   qhs.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status. Today he is still tachycardic to the 80-110's,
   but we will tolerate that for the time being.
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  Will continue to monitor daily.
   -transfuse if below 21
   .
   #PEG placement: Dobhoff placed yesterday, and is now more stable
   clinically.  Surgery and GI have deferred placement of PEG to IR b/c of
   h/o volvulus, low albumin, and low Hcts.  IR so far has agreed to do
   procedure today.
   - Nutrition consult for PEG feeds
   .
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
   .
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Has really improved with
   treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Off of lasix gtt; consider Lasix later today pending I
s and O
   - Renal team has signed off
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor, especially w/ starting cefepime.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Had poor motility with paralysis causing bowel
   distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds. Patient has had some
   loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that he is not infected
   given that he is on a large number of antibiotics and was negative X3.
   Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving his distention.
   - Bowel regimen.
   - Continue rectal tube
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds. PEG to be
   placed by IR. Dobhoff in place for now.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 1 peripherals, A-line (might need to re-wire today). Placed
   order for PICC to be placed tomorrow, for antibiotic delivery.
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily.
   Disposition: Pending improved respiratory status.
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A/H1N1. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He received tracheostomy placement, Dobhoff tube placement, and has been on antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin) for MRSA and double pseudomonas coverage. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tachypneic and alkalotic, indicating possible worsening of ARDS. The ventilator settings have been adjusted accordingly.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient's fever curve and leukocytosis improved with antibiotics and removal of central venous catheter. Antibiotic coverage will continue, and if the patient remains afebrile, single pseudomonal coverage may be considered.

3. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient was previously on insulin gtt but switched to Glargine 40U qhs and SSI. His increasing SSI needs led to the initiation of tube feeds. Insulin requirements will be re-calculated today, and Glargine dosage increased to 45U qhs.

4. Tachycardia: The patient remains tachycardic, likely due to multifocal atrial tachyc"

   # Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  This morning he is tachypneic and alkalotic.  This does not
   change with decreasing pressure support.  We will tolerate this for
   now, and attempt to have more uniform sedation with long-acting
   methadone rather than bolusing fentanyl once an hour.
   - Start methadone 10mg TID
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, f/u mini-BAL
   - Continue antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro (all 3 started on
   [**12-23**]) for MRSA and double pseudomonas coverage
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Attempt trach-mask trial today
   - Wean down FiO2
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia.  We will continue all antibiotics
   for now and consider narrowing to single pseudomonal coverage if he
   remains afebrile.
   - Continue antibiotics for empiric coverage = vancomycin, cefepime,
   ciprofloxacin (started all 3 on [**12-23**])
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip and mini-BAL
   .
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs; now on tubefeeds
   - Re-calculate insulin requirements today
 increased glargine to 45U
   qhs.

   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status. Today he is still tachycardic to the 80-110's,
   but we will tolerate that for the time being.
   - monitor on telemetry

   #PEG placement: Dobhoff placed yesterday, and is now more stable
   clinically.  Surgery and GI have deferred placement of PEG to IR b/c of
   h/o volvulus, low albumin, and low Hcts.  IR so far has agreed to do
   procedure today.
   - Contact IR for scheduling
   - Nutrition consult for PEG feeds

   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Has really improved with
   treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Off of lasix gtt; consider Lasix later today pending I
s and O
   - Renal team has signed off

   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.

   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor, especially w/ starting cefepime.

   #Abdominal distension: Had poor motility with paralysis causing bowel
   distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds. Patient has had some
   loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that he is not infected
   given that he is on a large number of antibiotics and was negative X3.
   Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving his distention.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS caused by influenza A/H1N1. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and has been on mechanical ventilation. He was initially on sedating drips but has been weaned off for the past two days. The patient's respiratory status improved initially but deteriorated this morning with increased tachypnea and alkalosis. The ventilator settings were adjusted, and the patient is currently tolerating pressure support.

The patient's fever curve and leukocytosis improved with antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin) and removal of central venous line. These antibiotics were started on 12/23 and will be continued. Follow-up cultures are pending.

The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and was previously on insulin gtt. He is now on glargine 40U qhs and short-acting insulin (SSI). His insulin requirements are being re-calculated, and the dose of glargine has been increased to 45U qhs.

The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, which is currently being monitored on telemetry. Anemia has stabilized, and hematocrits are being monitored daily. If the patient's hematocrit falls below 21, a blood transfusion will be considered.

   The tracheostomy tip is at the midline with its tip 3 cm above the
   carina.
   The Dobbhoff tube tip is in the prepyloric location distal stomach, no
   change
   in extensive parenchymal opacities in cardiomediastinal silhouette is
   demonstrated in the short-term interval, thus the potentially present
   volume
   overload did not significantly change since the prior study.
   Microbiology: All cultures NTD; some PMN in sputum
   Assessment and Plan
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 2 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  This morning he is tachypneic and alkalotic.  This does not
   change with decreasing pressure support.  We will tolerate this for
   now, and attempt to have more uniform sedation with long-acting
   methadone rather than bolusing fentanyl once an hour.
   - Start methadone 10mg TID
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, f/u mini-BAL
   - Continue antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro (all 3 started on
   [**12-23**]) for MRSA and double pseudomonas coverage
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Attempt trach-mask trial today
   - Wean down FiO2
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia.  We will continue all antibiotics
   for now and consider narrowing to single pseudomonal coverage if he
   remains afebrile.
   - Continue antibiotics for empiric coverage = vancomycin, cefepime,
   ciprofloxacin (started all 3 on [**12-23**])
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip and mini-BAL
   .
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs; now on tubefeeds
   - Re-calculate insulin requirements today
 increased glargine to 45U
   qhs.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status. Today he is still tachycardic to the 80-110's,
   but we will tolerate that for the time being.
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  Will continue to monitor daily.
   -transfuse if below 21
   .
   #PEG placement: Dobhoff placed yesterday, and is now more stable
   clinically.  Surgery and GI have deferred placement of PEG to IR b/c of
   h/o volvulus, low albumin, and low Hcts.  IR so far has agreed to do
   procedure today.
   - Contact IR for scheduling
   - Nutrition consult for PEG feeds
   .
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
   .
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Has really improved with
   treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Off of lasix gtt; consider Lasix later today pending I
s and O
   - Renal team has signed off
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   .
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor, especially w/ starting cefepime.
   .
   #Abdominal distension: Had poor motility with paralysis causing bowel
   distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds. Patient has had some
   loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that he is not infected
   given that he is on a large number of antibiotics and was negative X3.
   Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving his distention.
   - Bowel regimen.
   - Continue rectal tube
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   .
   #GERD: PPI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds. PEG to be
   placed by IR. Dobhoff in place for now.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 2 peripherals, A-line (might need to re-wire today). Placed
   order for PICC to be placed tomorrow, for antibiotic delivery.
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily.
   Disposition: Pending improved respiratory status.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS caused by influenza A/H1N1. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Currently, the patient's condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is tachypneic and alkalotic, which suggests that his respiratory status has worsened. This could be due to fluid overload or possible bacterial pneumonia.
- Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient's fever curve and leukocytosis improved with antibiotics, indicating a response to treatment. However, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection.
- DM2: The patient's diabetes management has been adjusted, switching from insulin gtt to Glargine 40U qhs and SSI. His increasing SSI needs are being addressed.
- Tachycardia: The patient is still experiencing tachycardia, but it is being tolerated for now.
- Anemia: The patient's hematocrits have stabilized, and transfusion will be considered if below 21.
- PEG placement: Surgery and GI have deferred the placement of PEG due to the patient's h/o volvulus, low albumin, and low Hcts. However, IR has agreed to perform the procedure today.
- Critical illness myopathy: A PT consult"

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   # Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for 3 days and had been doing well on pressure
   support.  This morning he continues to be respiratorily alkalotic. Has
   started on Methadone to try and decrease his tachypnea, instead of
   bolusing sedatives.
   - Continue methadone 10mg TID to address tachypnea
   - F/u ABG this afternoon
   - Trach mask trial later today
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, f/u mini-BAL
   - Continue antibiotics: vanc, cefipime, and cipro (all 3 started on
   [**12-23**] --> today is day 4) for MRSA and double pseudomonas coverage
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Wean down FiO2
   - 2L diuresis again today given worsening effusions
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia.  We will continue all antibiotics
   for now and consider narrowing to single pseudomonal coverage if he
   remains afebrile.
   - Continue antibiotics for empiric coverage = vancomycin, cefepime,
   ciprofloxacin (started all 3 on [**12-23**])
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip and mini-BAL
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs; now on tubefeeds
   - Re-calculate insulin requirements today
 increased glargine to 45U
   qhs.
   - Watch BS's through the day and increase accordingly
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status. Today he is still tachycardic to the 80-110's,
   but we will tolerate that for the time being.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  Will continue to monitor daily.
   -transfuse if below 21
   #PEG placement: Currently getting Novasource renal
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Has really improved with
   treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Off of lasix gtt; consider Lasix later today pending I
s and O
   - Renal team has signed off
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   - Continue to monitor, especially w/ starting cefepime.
   #Abdominal distension: Had poor motility with paralysis causing bowel
   distention.  Will continue gentle tube feeds. Patient has had some
   loose stools today, checked C. diff to ensure that he is not infected
   given that he is on a large number of antibiotics and was negative X3.
   Rectal tube placed which seems to be improving his distention.
   - Bowel regimen.
   - Continue rectal tube
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 1 peripherals, A-line (might need to re-wire today). Placed
   order for PICC to be placed tomorrow, for antibiotic delivery.
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily.
   Disposition: Pending improved respiratory status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2111-12-18**] and has had multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS/sepsis combined with fluid overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Despite tracheostomy placement and weaning off sedating drips, he continues to be respiratorially alkalotic. There is a plan to continue methadone to address tachypnea, perform a tracheostomy mask trial, and follow up with ABG results.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient's fever curve and leukocytosis improved with antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime) and removal of the central venous (CV) line. However, the antibiotics will be continued for now, and consideration will be given to narrowing single pseudomonal coverage if the patient remains afebrile.
3. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2): The patient was on insulin gtt until recently, but has been switched to Glargine 40U qhs and short-acting insulin (SSI). His increasing SSI needs prompted the initiation of tube"

   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   # Respiratory failure: Originally ARDS/sepsis combined w/ fluid
   overload and possible bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a trach placed.  Has
   been off sedating drips for several days and had been doing well on
   pressure support.  Has started on Methadone to try and decrease his
   tachypnea, instead of bolusing sedatives, and also as a wean from the
   sedation that he has been on for the past several weeks.
   - Continue methadone 10mg TID to address tachypnea
   - F/u ABG this afternoon
   - Trach mask trial later today
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, f/u mini-BAL
   - Will d/c ABx today as we have no clear source that we were treating
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Wean down FiO2
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia, was then restarted on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro.
   - Will d/c ABx as above as we have no clear source that we are
   treating.
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip and mini-BAL
   # DM2: Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine
   40U qhs and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs; now on tubefeeds
   - Glargine has been recently increased to 45 qhs
   - Watch BS's through the day and increase accordingly
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  Will continue to monitor daily.
   -transfuse if below 21
   #PEG placement: Currently getting Novasource renal
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Has really improved with
   treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Renal team has signed off
   - Cr within baseline
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 1 peripherals, A-line. Placed order for PICC to be placed
   tomorrow, for antibiotic delivery.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, altered mental status, and anemia. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on the tracheostomy mask.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 859 K/uL, normal hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, slightly low platelet count of 108 K/uL, and normal electrolyte levels except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L. The blood glucose level is elevated at 275 mg/dL. Other lab values, including kidney function tests and liver enzymes, are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging shows a chest X-ray with mild obscuring of the hemi-diaphragm bilaterally and diffuse increase in interstitial markings, which may be due to the technique used for the lordotic film or could indicate pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

The assessment and plan include several conditions, including respiratory alkalosis, pulmonary edema, fever, tachycardia, rash, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory"

   Mildly tachypneic when interacting with people, but otherwise has RR
   down to 12-13.  Will start to wean methadone.  Now off of antibiotics
   and afebrile.  Still requiring frequent suctioning of thick secretions,
   but has a good cough.
   - wean methadone to 7.5mg TID
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Wean down FiO2
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia, was then restarted on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, which was stopped yesterday b/c there was no clear
   source for his recent fevers.
   - follow-up remaining pending cultures.
   # DM2: Mildly hypoglycemic overnight, now stable.  Recently restarted
   tubefeeds, which are now at goal.
   Glargine reduced to 35units QHS.
   - Watch BS's through the day tomorrow.
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  Will continue to monitor daily.
   -transfuse if below 21
   # Thrombocytosis: patient has had stably high platelet counts, which is
   new on this admission and likely reactive.
   - monitor daily.
   #PEG placement: Currently getting Novasource renal
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Has really improved with
   treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Renal team has signed off
   - Cr within baseline
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension who presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been in the ICU and has shown improvement in his respiratory status, but still requires frequent suctioning of thick secretions. The patient's fever curve and leukocytosis have improved with antibiotics, and the antibiotics have been discontinued. The patient's blood glucose levels have been stable, and he has started receiving tube feeds through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially on mechanical ventilation but is now tolerating a tracheostomy collar well. He is mildly tachypneic when interacting with people but has a reduced respiratory rate. The plan is to wean off methadone and continue nebulizer treatments and suctioning.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia overnight but is now stable. His insulin dose has been reduced, and he will be monitored for blood sugar levels throughout the day.

3. Alkalosis, respiratory: The patient has respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation.

4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray suggests fluid overload or congestive heart failure (CHF).

5. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia caused by influenza A/H1N1. The patient was initially diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and fluid overload. He underwent tracheostomy placement and has been on mechanical ventilation support.

Current Assessment:
The patient's condition has improved significantly. He is now off sedating drips and is on methadone to decrease tachypnea. An ABG test showed pH 7.44, which indicates respiratory alkalosis. The patient has been doing well on pressure support. He will continue to have a trach mask trial later today, and his cultures of blood, sputum, and urine will be followed up, along with a mini-BAL. Antibiotics will be discontinued as there is no clear source of infection.

Diagnoses and Plan:

   # Respiratory failure:  Now on trach collar and tolerating well.
   Mildly tachypneic when interacting with people, but otherwise has RR
   down to 12-13.  Would continue methadone today and then begin to
   taper.  Now off of antibiotics and afebrile.
   - Continue methadone 10mg TID to address tachypnea
   - F/u ABG this afternoon
   - Trach mask trial later today
   - F/u cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, f/u mini-BAL
   - Will d/c ABx today as we have no clear source that we were treating
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Wean down FiO2
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia, was then restarted on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro.
   - Will d/c ABx as above as we have no clear source that we are
   treating.
   - Follow up all cultures, including catheter tip and mini-BAL
   # DM2: Mildly hypoglycemic overnight, now stable.  Recently restarted
   tubefeeds.
   Was on insulin gtt until recently, but now switched to Glargine 40U qhs
   and SSI. Has increasing SSI needs; now on tubefeeds.
   - Watch BS's through the day and increase accordingly
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  Will continue to monitor daily.
   -transfuse if below 21
   #PEG placement: Currently getting Novasource renal
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
   Other stable issues:
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Has really improved with
   treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Renal team has signed off
   - Cr within baseline
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Also suggested some changes to his eye-drops and outpatient follow-up.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 1 peripherals, A-line. Placed order for PICC to be placed
   tomorrow, for antibiotic delivery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A/H1N1. The patient is currently in the ICU recovering from ARDS. He has been weaned off antibiotics and is afebrile. The patient is tolerating a tracheostomy collar well, but still has mild tachypnea. He will continue methadone to address tachypnea and have a follow-up ABG this afternoon. The patient's fever curve and leukocytosis improved with antibiotics and central venous line removal. His blood cultures, sputum cultures, and mini-BAL cultures are pending. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is stable, but he experienced mild hypoglycemia overnight. He was restarted on tube feeds and his blood sugars will be monitored throughout the day. The patient had anemia, but hematocrits are now stable. A PEG placement was done. The patient may have critical illness myopathy, and a physical therapy consult has been requested. The patient's renal failure has improved with treatment and improvement of ARDS. His urine output and creatinine have improved, and the renal team has signed off. The patient had eye redness and discharge, possibly due to contact lens use, and was seen by ophthalmology. He was prescribed prednisolone and tobramycin drops for his right"

   # Respiratory failure:  Now on trach collar and tolerating well.
   Mildly tachypneic when interacting with people, but otherwise has RR
   down to 12-13.  Will start to wean methadone.  Now off of antibiotics
   and afebrile.  Still requiring frequent suctioning of thick secretions,
   but has a good cough.  FIO2 weaned down maximally to 35-40%.
   - Continue to wean methadone from 7.5mg TID to 20mg once daily
   - Continue nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia, was then restarted on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, which was stopped yesterday b/c there was no clear
   source for his recent fevers.
   - follow-up remaining pending cultures; NTD
   # DM2: Mildly hypoglycemic overnight, now stable.  Recently restarted
   tubefeeds, which are now at goal.
   Glargine reduced to 35units QHS.   Blood glucose has stabilized.
   - Monitor BS's less frequently, q6h
   .
   Less active/resolved problems:
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status.
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  Will continue to monitor daily.
   -transfuse if below 21
   .
   # Thrombocytosis: patient has had stably high platelet counts, which is
   new on this admission and likely reactive.
   - monitor daily.
   .
   #PEG placement: Currently getting Novasource renal
   .
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
   .
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Improved with treatment
   and improvement of ARDS.  Renal team has signed off.  Cr within
   baseline.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.  Speech and
   swallow eval and trach valve eval today.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen.

   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now on trach collar and tolerating well.
   Mildly tachypneic when interacting with people, but otherwise has RR
   down to 12-13.  Will start to wean methadone.  Now off of antibiotics
   and afebrile.  Still requiring frequent suctioning of thick secretions,
   but has a good cough.
   - wean methadone to 7.5mg TID
   - Nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   - Wean down FiO2
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia, was then restarted on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, which was stopped yesterday b/c there was no clear
   source for his recent fevers.
   - follow-up remaining pending cultures.
   # DM2: Mildly hypoglycemic overnight, now stable.  Recently restarted
   tubefeeds, which are now at goal.
   Glargine reduced to 35units QHS.
   - Watch BS's through the day tomorrow.
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  Will continue to monitor daily.
   -transfuse if below 21
   # Thrombocytosis: patient has had stably high platelet counts, which is
   new on this admission and likely reactive.
   - monitor daily.
   #PEG placement: Currently getting Novasource renal
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - F/u PT consult
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Has really improved with
   treatment and improvement of ARDS.
   - Renal team has signed off
   - Cr within baseline
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here.
   #GERD: PPI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, PPI and bowel regimen
   Access: 1 peripheral, A-line. Mid-line (was supposed to be PICC, but
   would not advance fully).

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension presenting with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has several ongoing medical complications.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is now on a tracheostomy collar and tolerating it well. He is mildly tachypneic but otherwise has a reduced respiratory rate. The plan is to wean him off the methadone, continue nebulizer treatments and suctioning, and gradually decrease the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient's fever curve and leukocytosis improved with antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin) and central venous line removal. However, there is no clear source for his recent fevers. The antibiotics have been discontinued, and follow-up cultures are pending.

3. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2): The patient was mildly hypoglycemic overnight but is now stable. He has restarted tube feeds, which are at goal. Glargine dosage has been reduced to 35 units at bedtime, and blood sugar levels will be monitored throughout the day tomorrow.

4. Tachycardia: The patient previously had multifocal atrial tachycardia. He was started on Lopressor but it was"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS caused by influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially on a tracheostomy collar and required respiratory support. Although he is tolerating well now, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to his underlying conditions and the possibility of recurrent infections.

2. Pneumonia/Others: The patient had pneumonia/ARDS initially and received appropriate antibiotics. However, there is still a risk of developing other types of pneumonia or respiratory infections due to his compromised lung function and prolonged ICU stay.

3. Sepsis: The patient had fevers and leukocytosis, which improved with antibiotics. Although the recent fever curve is stable, there is still a risk of sepsis due to his immunocompromised state and potential sources of infection.

4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Type II: The patient has DM type II and experienced hypoglycemia. It is essential to monitor his blood glucose levels closely to maintain stable glycemic control.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient also had episodes of hyperglycemia, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Regular monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced mild hypoglycemia overnight, which requires close monitoring of blood glucose levels.
2. Diabetes Mellitus Type II (DM2): The patient has been restarted on tubefeeds, which are now at goal, and Glargine has been reduced to 35 units QHS. Blood glucose has stabilized/improved, so regular monitoring of blood sugar is necessary.
3. Alkalosis, respiratory: The patient has mild respiratory alkalosis, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Pulmonary Edema: Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's history of ARDS and pneumonia suggests a potential risk for pulmonary edema.
5. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient had fevers initially, but they have improved with antibiotics. It is important to follow up on remaining pending cultures.
6. Tachycardia, other: The patient had multifocal atrial tachycardia, and his heart rate is within an appropriate range."

   Imaging: [**2111-12-29**]
   TECHNIQUE: Single bedside AP examination labeled ""up"" is compared with
   a series of more-frequent-than-daily studies, dating back to [**2111-12-7**].
   The patient is status post tracheostomy and, as on the most recent
   studies, there is a diffuse, coarse, both interstitial and alveolar
   process involving both lungs; there is little normally-aerated lung.
   Unchanging opacities in this distribution are most suggestive of ARDS.
   Allowing for this, there is no gross pulmonary vascular congestion, and
   no change in heart size or development of pleural effusions to indicate
   a component of volume overload/CHF. Since the most recent study, the
   Dobbhoff enteric tube has been removed, with likely gastrojejunostomy
   tubing overlying the right paramedian
   upper abdomen.
   Assessment and Plan
   56M with asthma, DM, HTN presenting with respiratory distress and
   pneumonia/ARDS from influenza A/H1N1.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Now on trach collar and tolerating well.
   Mildly tachypneic when interacting with people, but otherwise has RR
   down to 12-13.  Will start to wean methadone.  Now off of antibiotics
   and afebrile.  Still requiring frequent suctioning of thick secretions,
   but has a good cough.  FIO2 weaned down maximally to 35-40%.
   - Methadone at 5 mg TID.  Will continue to wean at rehab
   - Continue nebulizer treatments and suctioning
   .
   #Fevers/leukocytosis: Fever curve and leukocytosis improved with
   antibiotics (on vanc, cipro and cefepime) and CV line removal. Had
   completed courses of Azithro, Peramivir, vanco and aztreonam for
   bacterial overgrowth of pneumonia, was then restarted on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, which was stopped yesterday b/c there was no clear
   source for his recent fevers.  All cultures have been negative, no
   longer having fevers.
   .
   # DM2: Mildly hypoglycemic overnight, now stable.  Recently restarted
   tubefeeds, which are now at goal.
   Glargine reduced to 35units QHS.   Blood glucose has
   stabilized/improved.
   - continue sliding scale at rehab
   .
   # Muddy-brown wax in outer ear canal (right):
   - cipro ear drops, 7 day course, day #1 = [**12-29**]
   .
   Less active/resolved problems:
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously appeared to have multifocal atrial
   tachycardia. Patient started previously on Lopressor; then held for
   tenuous clinical status. Continue to hold the lopressor, as HR
   appropriate range.  Patient with abnormal runs of MAT again this
   morning.
   - restart lopressor at rehab and titrate to HR<80 and SBP >100
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrits stable for several days now after trending down
   on admission.  No longer in need of transfusions.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis: patient has had stably high platelet counts, which is
   new on this admission and likely reactive. Patient no longer in need of
   platelets
   .
   #PEG placement: Currently getting Novasource renal
   .
   # Critical illness myopathy:
   - continue PT at rehab center
   .
    #Renal failure: Urine output and creatinine have improved.  Had
   component of ATN with muddy casts in urine.  Improved with treatment
   and improvement of ARDS.  Renal team has signed off.  Cr within
   baseline.
   .
   # Eye redness and discharge: Per nursing, patient had contact in his
   right eye which was only removed the other day as there was no record
   that patient wore contacts. Unable to find contact in left eye.  Seen
   by ophthalmology who mentioned that contact was intentionally there.
   Patient already has outpatient appointment set up.
   - Prednisolone and tobramycin drops to R eye as prescribed.  To be
   continued at rehab until follows up with ophthamology
   - Artificial tears ointment to both eyes as needed
   - Put outpatient appointment with ophtho into the D/C planning.
   .
   # Rash: Rash improved after zosyn d/c
d.  No signs of DRESS.  Did have
   some follicles which are improving.
   - Chlorhexadine wash on arms and legs to help prevent infection of
   follicles
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Per most recent d/c summary, Synthroid at 50mcg daily
   or 25 IV.  Continued here. TSH normal, continue dose as is.
   .
   # GERD: restart PPI.
    .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, renal tube feeds.  Patient with
   trach and now with PMV placed; needs adjustment (cough resulted in
   exhalation of stream of air) so f/u with speech & swallow again today
   for PMV adjustment. Check with nutrition re; iron deficiency.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; pneumoboots, bowel regimen, PPI.
   Access: Mid-line. (Peripheral IV and A-line have been pulled).
   Code:  Full Code as discussed with parents.
   Communication: Father and mother who are in to see him daily.
   Disposition: Pending improved secretions.  Being moved to rehab at Mt
   Sinaii
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN) who presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS due to influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been in the ICU and has shown improvement. The patient is now on a tracheostomy collar, tolerating well, and has a good cough. The patient's fever curve and leukocytosis have improved with antibiotics, and the patient is no longer febrile. The patient's DM2 is stable, and tubefeeds are at goal. The patient's muddy-brown wax in the outer ear canal is being treated with cipro ear drops. The patient previously had tachycardia, anemia, thrombocytosis, PEG placement, critical illness myopathy, renal failure, eye redness and discharge, rash, hypothyroidism, and GERD. These conditions have either resolved or are being managed appropriately. The patient is scheduled for rehabilitation at Mount Sinai and will have follow-up appointments for various conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still requiring frequent suctioning of thick secretions, which can lead to further respiratory distress if not managed properly.
2. Infection: Although the patient's fever curve and leukocytosis have improved with antibiotics, there is still a risk of developing new infections due to the immunocompromised state caused by AR"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia/ARDS caused by influenza A/H1N1. The patient has been in the ICU and has shown improvement over time.

Current Assessment:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is now on a tracheostomy collar and tolerating well. He is mildly tachypneic but has a good cough. FIO2 has been weaned down to 35-40%. The plan is to continue weaning off methadone and continue nebulizer treatments and suctioning.

2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient's fever curve and leukocytosis improved with antibiotics. There is no clear source for his recent fevers, so follow-up cultures are pending.

3. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2): The patient was mildly hypoglycemic overnight but is now stable. Tubefeeds are being restarted and Glargine has been reduced to 35 units QHS. Blood glucose levels have stabilized/improved. Monitoring of blood sugars every 6 hours is recommended.

4. Muddy-brown wax in the outer ear canal (right): Cipro ear drops will be used for a 7-day course starting on [**12-29**].

5. Tachycardia: The patient previously had multifocal atrial tach"
