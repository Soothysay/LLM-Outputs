   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84M with history of CAD, CHF, Afib on coumadin, presents with
   fatigue, hematocrit drop, and guaiac positive black stools.
   .
   # Hematocrit drop: Likely secondary to upper GI bleed in the setting of
   mildly supratherapeutic INR. Pt has noted dark brown-black stools at
   home for the past few weeks, likely melena. DDx would include peptic
   ulcer disease, esophagitis/gastritis, AVM. Small amounts of BRB on
   toilet paper likely secondary to known hemorrhoids, however cannot rule
   out a slow lower GI source. His complaint of fatigue is likely
   secondary to anemia. Has received 1u RBC in the ED and 10mg IV vitamin
   K. Was reportedly hypotensive at his PCP's office on the day of
   admission but remained normotensive in the MICU after receiving 1u RBC.
   He is v-paced. He received an additional 2 units pRBC
s after arriving
   on the floor without an appropriate increase in HCT.
   - will transfuse additional 2u RBC (for 5 units total)
   - check post-transfusion hct
   - maintain 2 PIVs
   - GI aware with plan for likely EGD today
   - will keep NPO for now
   - IV protonix
   .
   # Acute on CKD: Cr up to 2.5 from [**Year (4 digits) 294**] of 1.8. Etiology is likely
   pre-renal in the setting of GI bleed. Getting intravascular repletion
   with RBC transfusion; improved today to 2.2
   - cont to monitor BUN/Cr
   - will hold diuretics for now
   .
   # CAD: History of multiple stents and CABG but no chest pain currently.
   - will hold aspirin in the setting of GI bleed
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol given recent hypotension
   .
   # CHF: Last Echo in our system is from [**2163**] with EF 20%. Currently
   appears euvolemic.
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol, spironolactone, and lasix in the
   setting of GI bleed and borderline BP
   .
   # Hypotension with h/o HTN: Pt is currently borderline hypotensive
   however per the ED discussion with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 294**] SBP is ~90s to low
   100s.
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol, and lasix for now
   .
   # DMII: Diet-controlled at home.
   - will cover with insulin sliding scale in house
   .
   # Afib: INR supratherapeutic on admission. Holding coumadin and
   reversing INR as above in the setting of GI bleed.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cont zetia.
   .
   # Ppx: pneumoboots, PPI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with fatigue, hematocrit drop, and guaiac positive black stools. The patient received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), with an increase in hematocrit from 20.7 to 23.6. He is currently receiving additional 2 units of pRBCs, with plans for an endoscopy today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/51-63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. His laboratory results show anemia, elevated creatinine level, and prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR). 

Potential medical complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed (peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis/gastritis, arteriovenous malformation) leading to anemia and hypotension.
2. Acute kidney injury (pre-renal) due to hypovolemia from GI bleed.
3. Coronary artery disease with history of multiple stents and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), currently stable"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 84M with history of CAD, CHF, Afib on coumadin, presents with
   fatigue, hematocrit drop, and guaiac positive black stools.
   .
   # Hematocrit drop: Likely secondary to upper GI bleed in the setting of
   mildly supratherapeutic INR. Pt has noted dark brown-black stools at
   home for the past few weeks, likely melena. DDx would include peptic
   ulcer disease, esophagitis/gastritis, AVM. Small amounts of BRB on
   toilet paper likely secondary to known hemorrhoids, however cannot rule
   out a slow lower GI source. His complaint of fatigue is likely
   secondary to anemia. Has received 1u RBC in the ED and 10mg IV vitamin
   K. Was reportedly hypotensive at his PCP's office on the day of
   admission but remained normotensive in the MICU after receiving 1u RBC.
   He is v-paced. He received an additional 2 units pRBC
s after arriving
   on the floor without an appropriate increase in HCT.
   - will transfuse additional 2u RBC
   - check post-transfusion hct
   - maintain 2 PIVs
   - GI aware with plan for likely EGD today
   - will keep NPO for now
   - IV protonix
   .
   # Acute on CKD: Cr up to 2.5 from [**Year (4 digits) 294**] of 1.8. Etiology is likely
   pre-renal in the setting of GI bleed. Getting intravascular repletion
   with RBC transfusion; improved today to 2.2
   - cont to monitor BUN/Cr
   - will hold diuretics for now
   .
   # CAD: History of multiple stents and CABG but no chest pain currently.
   - will hold aspirin in the setting of GI bleed
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol given recent hypotension
   .
   # CHF: Last Echo in our system is from [**2163**] with EF 20%. Currently
   appears euvolemic.
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol, spironolactone, and lasix in the
   setting of GI bleed and borderline BP
   .
   # Hypotension with h/o HTN: Pt is currently borderline hypotensive
   however per the ED discussion with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 294**] SBP is ~90s to low
   100s.
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol, and lasix for now
   .
   # DMII: Diet-controlled at home.
   - will cover with insulin sliding scale in house
   .
   # Afib: INR supratherapeutic on admission. Holding coumadin and
   reversing INR as above in the setting of GI bleed.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cont zetia.
   .
   # Ppx: pneumoboots, PPI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with fatigue, hematocrit drop, and guaiac positive black stools, indicating an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). He will receive an additional 2 units of pRBCs and undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate the source of bleeding. The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is likely pre-renal due to the GI bleed, and he will be closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances. Diuretics will be held for now. The patient's history of CAD, CHF, and hypertension will be managed by holding certain medications during the GI bleed. His diabetes will be managed with insulin sliding scale. The patient's supratherapeutic INR will be reversed, and he will discontinue warfarin due to the GI bleed. The patient is currently euvolemic, but his cardiac function may be compromised with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient's blood pressure has been borderline hypotensive, so certain medications will be held. He will continue to be monitored in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan:
   84 yo M with history of CAD, CHF, Afib on coumadin, presents with
   fatigue, hematocrit drop, and guaiac positive black stools.
   # Hematocrit drop: Likely secondary to upper GI bleed in the setting of
   mildly supratherapeutic INR. Received a total of 5 units of PRBCs since
   admission with serial HCTs yesterday revealing stability at HCt of ~29.
   This AM HCT was 32.3 and patient was hemodynamically stable overnight.
   INR is currently 1.5. EGD yesterday revealing on mild gastritis, which
   is unlikely to have caused a bleed this brisk and severe. Was prepped
   orally overnight in anticipation of colonscopy to be performed today.
   - Evening HCT check
   - maintain 2 PIVs and active type and screen
   - will keep NPO for now in anticipation of colonoscopy
   - IV pantoprazole twice daily
   # Acute on CKD: At admission, Cr up to 2.5 from [**Year (4 digits) 294**] of 1.8.
   Etiology was likely pre-renal in the setting of GI bleed. Following
   resuscitation, Cr has improved to 2 this AM. BUN trending down to 93
   this AM, likely elevated in setting of GI bleed.
   - Cont to monitor BUN/Cr
   - Will hold diuretics for now
   # CAD: History of multiple stents and CABG but no chest pain currently.
   - will hold aspirin in the setting of GI bleed
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol given recent hypotension
   # CHF: Last Echo in our system is from [**2163**] with EF 20%. Currently
   appears euvolemic.
   - Will hold lisinopril, nadolol, spironolactone, and lasix in the
   setting of GI bleed and borderline BP
   - Will add back agents as BP tolerates
   # Hypotension with h/o HTN: Pt is currently borderline hypotensive
   however per the ED discussion with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 294**] SBP is ~90s to low
   100s.
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol, and lasix for now
   # DMII: Diet-controlled at home.
   - will cover with insulin sliding scale in house
   # Afib: INR supratherapeutic on admission. Holding coumadin and
   reversing INR as above in the setting of GI bleed.
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue ezetimibe

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with fatigue, a drop in hematocrit, and positive black stool, indicating a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his hemodynamic status has been stable overnight. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed mild gastritis, which is unlikely to have caused the severe bleed. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) in anticipation of a colonoscopy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding due to the ongoing GI bleed and the presence of gastritis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline hypotensive, which could be due to blood loss and the use of antihypertensive medications.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of CKD and there was a significant increase in creatinine from 1.8 to 2.5 at admission. This could be due to pre-renal azotemia secondary to GI bleed. The current creatinine level is 2.0.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's potassium level is slightly low"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a frail-appearing elderly male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed gastritis but no clear source of bleeding. The patient is currently receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7Â°C (98Â°F)
- Heart Rate: 30 bpm (normal range: 30-75 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 101/36 mmHg (53/88 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 15 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-20 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,947 mL and total output of 2,860 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 913 mL. The patient's urine output is 2,460 mL, stool output is 400 mL, and blood product transfusion is 1,077 mL.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears frail and thin, with no respiratory distress. The cardiovascular examination shows normal S1/S2 heart sounds, and the peripheral vascular examination reveals diminished pulses in both lower extremities.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with fatigue, a drop in hematocrit, and guaiac positive black stools indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has received red blood cell transfusions and IV vitamin K. He is currently v-paced and has been given proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His blood pressure has been borderline hypotensive, and certain medications such as aspirin, lisinopril, nadolol, spironolactone, and lasix have been held due to the GI bleed. The patient's INR was supratherapeutic on admission and has been reversed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient has dark brown-black stools, indicating melena, and an elevated INR, which could contribute to bleeding. The source of the upper GI bleed is unclear but may be related to peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis/gastritis, or arteriovenous malformation (AVM).
2. Anemia: The patient's complaint of fatigue is likely secondary to anemia resulting from the GI bleed.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been borderline hypotensive, and his blood pressure needs to be closely monitored. Holding certain medications like lisinopril and nadol"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presented with fatigue, a drop in hematocrit, and guaiac positive black stools. The patient has been diagnosed with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely secondary to peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. He also has known hemorrhoids, which may contribute to small amounts of blood loss. The patient's complaint of fatigue is likely due to anemia caused by the GI bleed. He received 1 unit of red blood cells (RBC) in the emergency department and an additional 2 units on the floor, but his hematocrit has not appropriately increased. 

The patient's creatinine level has risen to 2.5 from a baseline of 1.8, indicating acute-on-chronic kidney disease, likely due to pre-renal causes in the setting of the GI bleed.

   Assessment and Plan:
   84 yo M with history of CAD, CHF, Afib on coumadin, presents with
   fatigue, hematocrit drop, and guaiac positive black stools.
   # Hematocrit drop: Likely secondary to upper GI bleed in the setting of
   mildly supratherapeutic INR. Received a total of 5 units of PRBCs since
   admission with serial HCTs yesterday revealing stability at HCt of ~29.
   This AM HCT was 32.3 and patient was hemodynamically stable overnight.
   INR is currently 1.5. EGD yesterday revealing on mild gastritis, which
   is unlikely to have caused a bleed this brisk and severe. Was prepped
   orally overnight in anticipation of colonscopy to be performed today.
   - Evening HCT check
   - maintain 2 PIVs and active type and screen
   - will keep NPO for now in anticipation of colonoscopy
   - IV pantoprazole twice daily
   # Acute on CKD: At admission, Cr up to 2.5 from [**Year (4 digits) 294**] of 1.8.
   Etiology was likely pre-renal in the setting of GI bleed. Following
   resuscitation, Cr has improved to 2 this AM. BUN trending down to 93
   this AM, likely elevated in setting of GI bleed.
   - Cont to monitor BUN/Cr
   - Will hold diuretics for now
   # CAD: History of multiple stents and CABG but no chest pain currently.
   - will hold aspirin in the setting of GI bleed
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol given recent hypotension
   # CHF: Last Echo in our system is from [**2163**] with EF 20%. Currently
   appears euvolemic.
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol, spironolactone, and lasix in the
   setting of GI bleed and borderline BP
   # Hypotension with h/o HTN: Pt is currently borderline hypotensive
   however per the ED discussion with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 294**] SBP is ~90s to low
   100s.
   - will hold lisinopril, nadolol, and lasix for now
   # DMII: Diet-controlled at home.
   - will cover with insulin sliding scale in house
   # Afib: INR supratherapeutic on admission. Holding coumadin and
   reversing INR as above in the setting of GI bleed.
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue ezetimibe

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He presented with fatigue, hematocrit drop, and guaiac positive black stools, indicating a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission and his hemoglobin levels have stabilized.

The patient's initial creatinine level was elevated at 2.5, but it has improved to 2 this morning. This suggests a possible pre-renal cause for the acute kidney injury (CKD), which is likely due to the GI bleed. The patient's BUN is also trending down, further supporting this hypothesis. 

The patient's cardiovascular history includes multiple stents and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), but he is not currently experiencing chest pain. Aspirin, lisinopril, nadolol, spironolactone, and lasix are being held due to the GI bleed and borderline blood pressure.

The patient's most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, indicating severe left ventricular dysfunction. However, he appears euvolemic at present. 

The patient has a history of hypertension (h/o HTN) and is currently borderline hypotensive. His primary care physician mentioned that his systolic"

The patient has been on various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and others. His fluid balance shows an intake of 1947 mL and output of 2860 mL, with a negative balance of 913 mL. The patient's blood products transfused were 1077 mL. His urine output is 2460 mL, and he has had 400 mL of nasogastric aspirate and stool output. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurologically, he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and oriented to time, place, and person. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, with elevated creatinine and blood glucose levels. The patient's blood pressure medication (ASA) will be restarted after the colonos"
