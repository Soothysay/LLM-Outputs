   Disposition:
","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, previous stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and dementia. He presents with a STEMI secondary to a thrombotic lesion in the mid-LAD, for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a bare metal stent (BMS). He also has significant lesions in the ramus and mid-RCA, as well as a 90% stenosis in a small distal LCx that were not intervened upon. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/77 to 100/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals a supple neck with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 8 cm, no chest wall deformities, mild crackles at the lung bases, soft abdomen with no tenderness, and pulses bilaterally intact. 

Laboratory findings show leukocyte count of 10.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 5.0 mEq/L, and glucose of 103 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated at 1.00, with CK and CKMB levels also elevated at 247 and 17, respectively. The PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated at 29.2/29.7/2.9. 

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, statin therapy with atorvastatin, beta-blocker therapy with metoprolol, and warfarin for anticoagulation given his history of DVT. He will be monitored for any potential complications such as hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and changes in mental status. 

The patient's disposition is currently in the CCU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presented with complaints of persistent back, shoulder discomfort, and chest tightness. The EKG showed evolving ST changes in anterior leads, indicating a possible heart attack or myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was hyperadrenergic with elevated heart rate and blood pressure, which could be due to the pain or an acute cardiac event. Nitroglycerin was initially started but caused hypotension, so it was stopped. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.4Â°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/77 mmHg to 100/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The physical examination revealed a well-oriented patient who appeared anxious. There were mild crackles at the lung bases, but no other significant findings. The abdominal examination was unremarkable, and the extremities showed no clubbing or edema. The patient's laboratory results indicated elevated white blood cell count (487 K/uL), low hemoglobin (12.6 g/dL), slightly elevated blood glucose (103 mg/dL), and normal platelet count (406 K/uL).

   Medical Decision Making
   88 male here with anterior STEMI aborted with BMS to LAD. Patient has
   lesions in the RCA, RI and LCx which require intervention. Will
   increase Metoprolol to 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**] and ACEI as BP tolerates. He will
   remain on coumadin for h/o DVT/PE. Ok to floor later today. Continue to
   trend enzymes.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension, previous stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on coumadin, and dementia. He presented with symptoms of persistent back, shoulder discomfort, and chest tightness. EKG showed evolving ST changes in anterior leads, and the patient was hyperadrenergic with elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Nitroglycerin was started but led to transient hypotension. The patient underwent coronary catheterization and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) to an 80% thrombotic mid-left anterior descending (LAD) lesion. There were also 80% lesions in the ramus and mid-right coronary artery (RCA), as well as a 90% stenosis in a small distal left circumflex artery (LCx) that were not intervened upon. The patient's recurrent pain is likely post-infarct discomfort. Medications include aspirin (ASA) 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily for one year, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, metoprolol 37.5 mg three times a day, warfarin, senna, docusate, Exelon, and Namenda.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Recurrent ischemia: The patient's recurrent pain may indicate ongoing ischemia or lack of adequate blood flow to the heart muscle.
2. Hypotension:"

   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2351**] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   CK peaked overnight at 1147 and the patient has no further chest pain.
   Echo shows mid to distal ant wall and septum are HK with EF 30-35% s/p
   LAD stenting for ASMI. He continue to have significant lesions in the
   LCx and RCA. He is intermittently confused and quite dysarthric. INR is
   3.1 to prevent mural thrombus. For CAD will continue ASA, Plavix, BB
   and Lisinopril 10 mg QD. Will add nitrates and plan to have the patient
   back in 1 month to stent the RCA and LCx. GI prophylaxis for coumadin,
   PLavix and ASA.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2351**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis on Coumadin. He presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the mid-LAD lesion. The patient has recurrent chest pain, likely post-infarct discomfort. His left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 35%. The patient has significant lesions in the ramus and mid-RCA, which were not intervened during the procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent ischemia: The patient's recurrent chest pain suggests ongoing ischemia, which could lead to further complications such as recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
2. Heart failure: With a reduced LVEF of 35%, the patient is at risk for developing heart failure due to the compromised pumping ability of the heart.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient's use of Coumadin puts him at risk for bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage. Additionally, post-myocardial infarction, patients are at an increased risk of developing arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.
4. Thromboembolism: The patient's history of DVT and current use of Coumadin indicate a risk for thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism.
5. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, including ASA, Pl"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2351**] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   CK peaked overnight at 1147 and the patient has no further chest pain.
   Echo shows mid to distal ant wall and septum are HK with EF 30-35% s/p
   LAD stenting for ASMI. He continue to have significant lesions in the
   LCx and RCA. He is intermittently confused and quite dysarthric. INR is
   3.1 to prevent mural thrombus. For CAD will continue ASA, Plavix, BB
   and Lisinopril 10 mg QD. Will add nitrates and plan to have the patient
   back in 1 month to stent the RCA and LCx. GI prophylaxis for coumadin,
   PLavix and ASA.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2351**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of hypertension, previous stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and dementia.
- He presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD).
- The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK and troponin-T) were elevated, indicating myocardial injury.
- An echocardiogram revealed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and distal anterior wall and septum, apex, and distal inferior segment (mid-LAD territory). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 35%.
- The patient had decreased urine output and required insertion of a Foley catheter.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/58 to 165/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air.
- Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin-T, and lactate.
- Imaging revealed mild left atrial dilation, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and mild dilation of the ascending aorta and aortic arch.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, previous stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and dementia. He presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with bare metal stent placement in the mid-LAD artery due to an 80% thrombotic lesion. The patient also has significant lesions in the ramus and mid-RCA, as well as a 90% stenosis in a small distal LCx, which were not intervened upon and are unlikely to be the cause of his chest pain.

The patient is currently experiencing recurrent pain concerning for recurrent ischemia, but it is more likely post-infarct discomfort. He is on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and a beta-blocker (to be switched to metoprolol). He will restart lisinopril and be monitored closely.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/58 mmHg to 165/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is on telemonitoring.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Other lab values are within normal limits.
