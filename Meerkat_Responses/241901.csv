","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation but tolerated it only for a short period. They were able to wear a face mask overnight. The patient received an IV dose of 80 mg lasix and subsequently produced about 200 cc in 3 hours. They were tachycardic in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 130s and had low blood pressure in the 80s. The patient received a 250 cc bolus. They had intermittent periods of being awake and agitated with a still depressed mental status.

The patient has allergies to Zestril (Lisinopril) and experiences cough as a side effect. The last dose of antibiotics administered was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2121-2-12**] at 02:25 AM. The patient is currently receiving IV furosemide (Lasix) since [**2121-2-11**] at 07:00 PM.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Flow sheet data shows that the patient's temperature is 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate is 122 bpm, blood pressure is 85/59 mmHg, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98%.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with multiple medical problems including DM, CAD, CHF, COPD,
   afib, MM, HTN and CKD who presents today with shorntess of breath
   consistent with a CHF exaccerbation.
   .
   # SOB: unclear etiology, although CXR suggests both fluid overload and
   potential infiltrate.  Is tolerating bipap but with an irregular
   breathing rhythm.
   - continue face mask and wean as tolerated
   - aggressive diuresis overnight as pressure tolerates
   - abx as below for pneumonia
   .
   # CHF: likely has CHF exaccerbation, unclear reason.  Was seen by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the ED who would not work her up with a catheterization.
   - diuresis overnight with 80 mg IV lasix PRN
   - monitor Cr and K+
   - ROMI for ischemia as cause
   - AM EKG
   - consider echo in morning
   .
   # Pneumonia: has possible RLL infiltrate on CXR, no leukocytosis or hx
   of fevers, although is mildly hypothermic.
   - cultures
   - vanco/zosyn coverage for now for HAP
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Afib: is in sinus tach right now.  Is systemically anticoagulated.
   - continue coumadin if able to take POs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - hold metoprolol and amiodoarone for now
   .
   # AMS: likely from combination of infection and hypoxia.  Has
   intermittent periods of awakeness, although not quite appropriate.
   continue to treat infection and metabolic derangements
   - consider EEG, neuro consult if not improving
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr is up from a baseline in the
   recent low 2.0s; potentially from decreased renal perfusion vs.
   prerenal etiology.  Is total body fluid overloaded but likely
   intravascularly dry.
   - send urine lytes
   - diuresis for now
   - trend Cr and electrolytes
   - monitor UO overnight
   .
   # HTN: hypotensive on exam today from cardiac shock v. septic shock.
   Is doing well on her own without boluses and are trying to diurese
   secondary to respiratory status.
   - hold antihypertensives for now
   .
   # Multiple Myeloma: unclear stage of MM; will follow up with outpatient
   oncologist.  Not currently under treatment.  [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to her
   renal failure.  Could be contributing to her depressed mental status if
   potential CSF involvement.
   - follow up with outpatient oncologist
   - defer LP for workup as goals of care are for non invasive procedures
   .
   # Anemia: stable at baseline.
   - guiac all stools
   - transfuse for Hct <21 unless troponin rise consistent with NSTEMI
   .
   # Troponin Leak: is mild, likely at baseline with her acute renal
   failure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be having demand ischemia or possible new ischemia with
   resultant heart failure.
   - trend CEs
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: possibly is post-ictal with her depressed mental
   status.  Does not appear to be in status now as she is minimally
   responsive and occassionally waking up to voice and nodding head
   appropriately.
   - continue dilantin for now if taking PO
   - check dilantin level in AM
   .
   # UTI: has positive UA; follow up culture, should be covered by zosyn
   as is being treated for PNA.
   - zosyn as above
   .
   # PPx: coumadin (systemic coagulation), no GI ppx indicated
   # FEN: no IVFs, NPO, replete electrolytes PRN
   # Access: PIVs x2
   # Communication: with daughter (HCP) who is in [**Hospital3 **] for rehab
   from knee surgery.  Contact through to the HCP is the granddaughter;
   phone number on white board.  Wants to be first contact in case of
   change.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, no central lines or pressors, minimal invasive
   procedures; confirmed in ED with HCP and again with family members who
   are pressent in the room
   # Dispo: in ICU for now.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), multiple myeloma (MM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

The patient presented with shortness of breath consistent with a CHF exacerbation. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been tolerating it well. However, her mental status remains depressed. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia in afib with a heart rate in the 130s and blood pressure in the 80s. She has received a 250 cc bolus due to hypotension. 

Her lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose level, and elevated creatinine level. 

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, crackles at the bases of the lungs, and diminished pulses in the upper and lower extremities. 

The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions:

1. SOB: unclear etiology, although CXR suggests both fluid overload and potential infiltrate. She is tolerating bipap but with an irregular breathing rhythm.
   - Continue face mask and wean as tolerated.
   - Aggressive diuresis overnight as pressure tolerates.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), multiple myeloma (MM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presented with shortness of breath consistent with a CHF exacerbation. The patient was initially placed on non-invasive ventilation but tolerated it well overnight. She was given a dose of 80 mg IV lasix and produced about 200 cc in 3 hours. Her blood pressure dropped, so she received a 250 cc bolus. The patient had intermittent periods of being awake and agitated, with a depressed mental status. She was tachycardic in afib with heart rates in the 130s and blood pressures in the 80s. She received antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 85/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and multiple myeloma. She presented with respiratory failure due to acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure. The patient was initially on non-invasive ventilation but was weaned off overnight. She is currently on a nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen, maintaining a SpO2 of 100%. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 96/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 35.5°C. The patient has a history of allergy to Lisinopril and is currently receiving furosemide and other ICU medications as per the resident's note. She was also on piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics until yesterday morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of congestive heart failure, development of hypotension, acute kidney injury, and possible infections due to the ongoing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note and may not encompass all aspects of the patient's condition. It is important to consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with multiple medical problems including DM, CAD, CHF, COPD,
   afib, MM, HTN and CKD who presents today with shortness of breath
   consistent with a CHF exacerbation.
   # SOB: Most likely CHF exacerbation. unclear etiology, although CXR
   suggests both fluid overload and potential infiltrate. Tolerated bipap
   but with an irregular breathing rhythm overnight and this morning
   weaned to 3LNC.
   - continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   - abx as below for pneumonia
   - will discuss dig dosing with pharmacy later today
   # CHF: likely has CHF exacerbation, unclear reason.  Was seen by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the ED who would not work her up with a catheterization.
   Diuresed overnight with 80 mg IV lasix, but BP dropped and fluid given
   back.  Overall still improved.
   - monitor Cr and K+
   - on 80 IV BID, aim to diurese with goal -500 L today
   - ROMI for ischemia as cause
   - consider echo
   # Pneumonia: has possible RLL infiltrate on CXR, no leukocytosis or hx
   of fevers, although is mildly hypothermic.
   - cultures
   - vanco/zosyn coverage for now for HAP
   - renally dose meds
   # Afib: is in sinus tach right now.  Is systemically anticoagulated and
   on amiodarone and metoprolol at home.  HR still in 110s
   - continue coumadin if able to take POs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - restart metoprolol
   - Continue to dig load, decided against amiodarone based on d/w dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   # AMS: Somnolent but alert, interactive. Per discussion with daughter
   likely at baseline. Any change likely from combination of infection and
   hypoxia. Has intermittent periods of awakeness, although not quite
   appropriate.
 continue to treat infection and metabolic derangements
   - consider EEG, neuro consult if worsens
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr is up from a baseline in the
   recent low 2.0s; potentially from decreased renal perfusion vs.
   prerenal etiology.  Is total body fluid overloaded but likely
   intravascularly dry.
   - add on urine lytes
   - diuresis for now
   - trend Cr and electrolytes
   - monitor UO overnight
   # HTN: now normotensive. hypotensive on exam [**2-12**] likely [**12-24**] cardiac
   shock v. septic shock.  Is doing well on her own without boluses and
   are trying to diurese secondary to respiratory status.
   - restart metoprolol as above
   # Multiple Myeloma: unclear stage of MM; will follow up with outpatient
   oncologist.  Not currently under treatment.  [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to her
   renal failure.  Could be contributing to her depressed mental status if
   potential CSF involvement.
   - follow up with outpatient oncologist
   - defer LP for workup as goals of care are for non invasive procedures
   # Anemia: stable at baseline.
   - guiac all stools
   - transfuse for Hct <21 unless troponin rise consistent with NSTEMI
   # Troponin Leak: is mild, likely at baseline with her acute renal
   failure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be having demand ischemia or possible new ischemia with
   resultant heart failure.
   - trend CEs
   # Seizure Disorder: possibly is post-ictal with her depressed mental
   status.  Does not appear to be in status now as she is minimally
   responsive and occassionally waking up to voice and nodding head
   appropriately.  Now answering questions appropriately, although she is
   disoriented.
   - continue dilantin for now if taking PO
   - check dilantin level in AM
   # UTI: has positive UA; follow up culture, should be covered by zosyn
   as is being treated for PNA.
   - zosyn as above
   # PPx: coumadin (systemic coagulation), no GI ppx indicated
   # FEN: no IVFs, regular diet, replete electrolytes PRN
   # Access: PIVs x2
   # Communication: with daughter (HCP) who is in [**Hospital3 **] for rehab
   from knee surgery.  Contact through to the HCP is the granddaughter;
   phone number on white board.  Wants to be first contact in case of
   change.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, no central lines or pressors, minimal invasive
   procedures; confirmed in ED with HCP and again with family members who
   are pressent in the room
   # Dispo: consider call out to [**Hospital1 2259**] today, will discuss with dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with multiple medical problems including DM, CAD, CHF, COPD,
   afib, MM, HTN and CKD who presents today with shortness of breath
   consistent with a CHF exacerbation.
   # SOB: unclear etiology, although CXR suggests both fluid overload and
   potential infiltrate.  Tolerated bipap but with an irregular breathing
   rhythm overnight and this morning weaned to 3LNC.
   - continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   - abx as below for pneumonia
   # CHF: likely has CHF exacerbation, unclear reason.  Was seen by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the ED who would not work her up with a catheterization.
   Diuresed overnight with 80 mg IV lasix, but BP dropped and fluid given
   back.  Overall still improved.
   - monitor Cr and K+
   - ROMI for ischemia as cause
   - consider echo
   # Pneumonia: has possible RLL infiltrate on CXR, no leukocytosis or hx
   of fevers, although is mildly hypothermic.
   - cultures
   - vanco/zosyn coverage for now for HAP
   - renally dose meds
   # Afib: is in sinus tach right now.  Is systemically anticoagulated and
   on amiodarone and metoprolol at home.  HR still in 110s
   - continue coumadin if able to take POs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue to hold metoprolol
   - Consider restarting amiodarone
   # AMS: likely from combination of infection and hypoxia.  Has
   intermittent periods of awakeness, although not quite appropriate.
   continue to treat infection and metabolic derangements
   - consider EEG, neuro consult if not improving
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr is up from a baseline in the
   recent low 2.0s; potentially from decreased renal perfusion vs.
   prerenal etiology.  Is total body fluid overloaded but likely
   intravascularly dry.
   - add on urine lytes
   - diuresis for now
   - trend Cr and electrolytes
   - monitor UO overnight
   # HTN: hypotensive on exam today from cardiac shock v. septic shock.
   Is doing well on her own without boluses and are trying to diurese
   secondary to respiratory status.
   - hold antihypertensives for now
   # Multiple Myeloma: unclear stage of MM; will follow up with outpatient
   oncologist.  Not currently under treatment.  [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to her
   renal failure.  Could be contributing to her depressed mental status if
   potential CSF involvement.
   - follow up with outpatient oncologist
   - defer LP for workup as goals of care are for non invasive procedures
   # Anemia: stable at baseline.
   - guiac all stools
   - transfuse for Hct <21 unless troponin rise consistent with NSTEMI
   # Troponin Leak: is mild, likely at baseline with her acute renal
   failure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be having demand ischemia or possible new ischemia with
   resultant heart failure.
   - trend CEs
   # Seizure Disorder: possibly is post-ictal with her depressed mental
   status.  Does not appear to be in status now as she is minimally
   responsive and occassionally waking up to voice and nodding head
   appropriately.  Now answering questions appropriately, although she is
   disoriented.
   - continue dilantin for now if taking PO
   - check dilantin level in AM
   # UTI: has positive UA; follow up culture, should be covered by zosyn
   as is being treated for PNA.
   - zosyn as above
   # PPx: coumadin (systemic coagulation), no GI ppx indicated
   # FEN: no IVFs, NPO, replete electrolytes PRN
   # Access: PIVs x2
   # Communication: with daughter (HCP) who is in [**Hospital3 **] for rehab
   from knee surgery.  Contact through to the HCP is the granddaughter;
   phone number on white board.  Wants to be first contact in case of
   change.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, no central lines or pressors, minimal invasive
   procedures; confirmed in ED with HCP and again with family members who
   are pressent in the room
   # Dispo: in ICU for now.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. She presents with shortness of breath consistent with a congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient's mental status remains confused, and she is hypothermic. She has a positive urine analysis but no leukocytosis or history of fevers. The patient is systemically anticoagulated and on amiodarone and metoprolol at home. Her heart rate is in the 110s, and she is currently in sinus tachycardia. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and she has acute-on-chronic renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. She also has anemia, mild troponin leak, possible seizure disorder, and a urinary tract infection. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI, no central lines or pressors, minimal invasive procedures, and desires to be the first contact in case of change. She is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which may indicate pneumonia. If not treated promptly, it could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially progress to sepsis.

2. Congestive heart failure exacerbation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple myeloma. She was admitted with respiratory failure due to CHF. Her current condition is stable, but she remains tachycardic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/CHF: The patient's respiratory failure is related to CHF. It is important to closely monitor her respiratory status and continue diuresis to manage fluid buildup.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia needs to be addressed as it can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and further strain on the heart. Digoxin has been loaded, and a maintenance dose will be started. Additionally, a low-dose beta-blocker should be initiated.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of somnolence. This requires monitoring for any signs of deterioration or improvement.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, indicating that her renal function is currently stable. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to detect any changes in renal function.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but close monitoring and management of her CHF, tachycardia, altered mental status, and renal function are crucial."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with multiple medical problems including DM, CAD, CHF, COPD,
   afib, MM, HTN and CKD who presents today with shortness of breath
   consistent with a CHF exacerbation.
   # SOB: Appears to have resolved, now on NC. Most likely CHF due to
   exacerbation.
   - continue supplemental oxygen as needed, try to wean to RA
   - D/c abx as respiratory distress was most likely due to CHF and not
   injection.
   - Continued digoxin 0.25 mg IV X 3 doses yesterday
   .
   # Pneumonia: has possible RLL infiltrate on CXR, no leukocytosis or hx
   of fevers, although is mildly hypothermic.
   - cultures
   - d/c zosyn
   .
   # CHF: likely has CHF exacerbation, unclear reason.  Was seen by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the ED who would not work her up with a catheterization.
   Diuresed overnight with 80 mg IV lasix, negative 1L yesterday.  Overall
   still improved.
   - monitor Cr and K+
   - Resume PO lasix (40 PO BID) for goal even today to 500cc negative.
   - Pt was ruled out for MI
   - Restarted on Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # Afib: is in sinus tach right now.  Is systemically anticoagulated and
   on amiodarone and metoprolol at home.  HR still in 110s
   - continue coumadin if able to take POs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - restarted metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   - Continue to dig load, decided against amiodarone based on d/w dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   - Check digoxin level today; then f/u with pharmacy re: digoxin dosing.
   # AMS: At baseline level of interaction this morning. Per discussion
   with daughter likely at baseline. Any change likely from combination of
   infection and hypoxia. Has intermittent periods of awakeness, although
   not quite appropriate.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr is up from a baseline in the
   recent low 2.0s; potentially from decreased renal perfusion vs.
   prerenal etiology.  Is total body fluid overloaded but likely

The patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented with shortness of breath consistent with a congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient has a possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, but without leukocytosis or fever. She is mildly hypothermic. The patient's creatinine and potassium levels are elevated, indicating acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is systemically anticoagulated and on amiodarone and metoprolol for atrial fibrillation. She is also being diuresed for congestive heart failure. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of infection and hypoxia. She has intermittent periods of awakeness but is not fully oriented. The patient's blood pressure is now normotensive, having previously been hypotensive on examination. The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, indicating troponin leak likely at baseline with acute renal failure.

   consistent with a CHF exacerbation.
   # SOB: Most likely CHF exacerbation. unclear etiology, although CXR
   suggests both fluid overload and potential infiltrate. Tolerated bipap
   but with an irregular breathing rhythm overnight and this morning
   weaned to 3LNC.
   - continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   - abx as below for pneumonia
   - will discuss dig dosing with pharmacy later today
   # CHF: likely has CHF exacerbation, unclear reason.  Was seen by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the ED who would not work her up with a catheterization.
   Diuresed overnight with 80 mg IV lasix, but BP dropped and fluid given
   back.  Overall still improved.
   - monitor Cr and K+
   - on 80 IV BID, aim to diurese with goal -500 L today
   - ROMI for ischemia as cause
   - consider echo
   # Pneumonia: has possible RLL infiltrate on CXR, no leukocytosis or hx
   of fevers, although is mildly hypothermic.
   - cultures
   - vanco/zosyn coverage for now for HAP
   - renally dose meds
   # Afib: is in sinus tach right now.  Is systemically anticoagulated and
   on amiodarone and metoprolol at home.  HR still in 110s
   - continue coumadin if able to take POs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - restart metoprolol
   - Continue to dig load, decided against amiodarone based on d/w dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   # AMS: Somnolent but alert, interactive. Per discussion with daughter
   likely at baseline. Any change likely from combination of infection and
   hypoxia. Has intermittent periods of awakeness, although not quite
   appropriate.
 continue to treat infection and metabolic derangements
   - consider EEG, neuro consult if worsens
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr is up from a baseline in the
   recent low 2.0s; potentially from decreased renal perfusion vs.
   prerenal etiology.  Is total body fluid overloaded but likely
   intravascularly dry.
   - add on urine lytes
   - diuresis for now
   - trend Cr and electrolytes
   - monitor UO overnight
   # HTN: now normotensive. hypotensive on exam [**2-12**] likely [**12-24**] cardiac
   shock v. septic shock.  Is doing well on her own without boluses and
   are trying to diurese secondary to respiratory status.
   - restart metoprolol as above
   # Multiple Myeloma: unclear stage of MM; will follow up with outpatient
   oncologist.  Not currently under treatment.  [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to her
   renal failure.  Could be contributing to her depressed mental status if
   potential CSF involvement.
   - follow up with outpatient oncologist
   - defer LP for workup as goals of care are for non invasive procedures
   # Anemia: stable at baseline.
   - guiac all stools
   - transfuse for Hct <21 unless troponin rise consistent with NSTEMI
   # Troponin Leak: is mild, likely at baseline with her acute renal
   failure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be having demand ischemia or possible new ischemia with
   resultant heart failure.
   - trend CEs
   # Seizure Disorder: possibly is post-ictal with her depressed mental
   status.  Does not appear to be in status now as she is minimally
   responsive and occassionally waking up to voice and nodding head
   appropriately.  Now answering questions appropriately, although she is
   disoriented.
   - continue dilantin for now if taking PO
   - check dilantin level in AM
   # UTI: has positive UA; follow up culture, should be covered by zosyn
   as is being treated for PNA.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. She presented with shortness of breath consistent with a congestive heart failure exacerbation. She is currently on supplemental oxygen and receiving antibiotics for possible pneumonia. Her blood pressure dropped after receiving intravenous lasix, so fluid was given back. Her creatinine and potassium levels are being monitored, and she is being diuresed with a goal of losing 500 mL of fluid today. ROMI for ischemia as a cause is being considered, and an echo may be done. She is also on amiodarone and metoprolol for her atrial fibrillation. 

The patient is somnolent but alert and interactive, with intermittent periods of wakefulness. She may have acute on chronic renal failure, and her urine output overnight will be monitored. She is now normotensive but was previously hypotensive and likely had cardiac or septic shock. 

The patient has multiple myeloma, which could be contributing to her renal failure and potentially depressed mental status. She is stable at baseline with anemia, and her troponin leak is mild and likely at baseline. She has a history of seizure disorder and a urinary tract infection, both of which are being treated.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with multiple medical problems including DM, CAD, CHF, COPD,
   afib, MM, HTN and CKD who presents today with shortness of breath
   consistent with a CHF exacerbation.
   # SOB: Most likely CHF exacerbation. unclear etiology, although CXR
   suggests both fluid overload and potential infiltrate. Tolerated bipap
   but with an irregular breathing rhythm overnight and this morning
   weaned to 3LNC.
   - continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   - abx as below for pneumonia
   - Continued digoxin 0.25 mg IV X 3 doses yesterday
   # CHF: likely has CHF exacerbation, unclear reason.  Was seen by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the ED who would not work her up with a catheterization.
   Diuresed overnight with 80 mg IV lasix, but BP dropped and fluid given
   back.  Overall still improved.
   - monitor Cr and K+
   - on 80 IV BID, aim to diurese with goal -500 L today
   - Pt was ruled out for MI
   - Restarted on Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Pneumonia: has possible RLL infiltrate on CXR, no leukocytosis or hx
   of fevers, although is mildly hypothermic.
   - cultures
   - Zosyn coverage for now for HAP
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Afib: is in sinus tach right now.  Is systemically anticoagulated and
   on amiodarone and metoprolol at home.  HR still in 110s
   - continue coumadin if able to take POs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - restarted metoprolol
   - Continue to dig load, decided against amiodarone based on d/w dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   # AMS: Somnolent but alert, interactive. Per discussion with daughter
   likely at baseline. Any change likely from combination of infection and
   hypoxia. Has intermittent periods of awakeness, although not quite
   appropriate.
 continue to treat infection and metabolic derangements
   - consider EEG, neuro consult if worsens
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr is up from a baseline in the
   recent low 2.0s; potentially from decreased renal perfusion vs.
   prerenal etiology.  Is total body fluid overloaded but likely
   intravascularly dry.
   - add on urine lytes
   - diuresis for now
   - trend Cr and electrolytes
   - monitor UO overnight
   # HTN: now normotensive. hypotensive on exam [**2-12**] likely [**12-24**] cardiac
   shock v. septic shock.  Is doing well on her own without boluses and
   are trying to diurese secondary to respiratory status.
   - restart metoprolol as above
   # Multiple Myeloma: unclear stage of MM; will follow up with outpatient
   oncologist.  Not currently under treatment.  [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to her
   renal failure.  Could be contributing to her depressed mental status if
   potential CSF involvement.
   - follow up with outpatient oncologist
   - defer LP for workup as goals of care are for non invasive procedures
   # Anemia: stable at baseline.
   - guiac all stools
   - transfuse for Hct <21 unless troponin rise consistent with NSTEMI
   # Troponin Leak: is mild, likely at baseline with her acute renal
   failure.  [**Month (only) 60**] be having demand ischemia or possible new ischemia with
   resultant heart failure.
   - trend CEs
   # Seizure Disorder: possibly is post-ictal with her depressed mental
   status.  Does not appear to be in status now as she is minimally
   responsive and occassionally waking up to voice and nodding head
   appropriately.  Now answering questions appropriately, although she is
   disoriented.
   - continue dilantin for now if taking PO
   - check dilantin level in AM
   # UTI: has positive UA; follow up culture, should be covered by zosyn
   as is being treated for PNA.
   - zosyn as above
   # PPx: coumadin (systemic coagulation), no GI ppx indicated
   # FEN: no IVFs, regular diet, replete electrolytes PRN
   # Access: PIVs x2
   # Communication: with daughter (HCP) who is in [**Hospital3 **] for rehab
   from knee surgery.  Contact through to the HCP is the granddaughter;
   phone number on white board.  Wants to be first contact in case of
   change.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, no central lines or pressors, minimal invasive
   procedures; confirmed in ED with HCP and again with family members who
   are pressent in the room
   # Dispo: call out to [**Hospital1 2259**] today

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presents with shortness of breath consistent with a congestive heart failure exacerbation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and findings on the chest X-ray suggesting fluid overload indicate a possible exacerbation of congestive heart failure. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function are essential.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a possible right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray, although without leukocytosis or fever. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Close monitoring for clinical improvement and potential worsening of respiratory status is necessary.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus tachycardia. It is important to continue anticoagulation therapy and monitor the heart rhythm and rate.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated from a baseline in the recent low 2.0s, potentially due to decreased renal perfusion or prerenal etiology. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.

5. Hypotension: The patient was"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple myeloma. She was admitted with respiratory failure due to CHF. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation (AFIB), acute on chronic heart failure (systolic and diastolic), and ineffective coping. She is receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Respiratory Failure/CHF: The patient's respiratory status is still a concern, as she has a history of CHF and respiratory failure. There is a decrease in negative inspiratory force (1.5L neg yesterday), indicating potential worsening of her respiratory function. Adjustments to diuretic medication (Lasix) may be necessary to manage fluid balance.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which needs to be controlled. She is currently on digoxin and metoprolol, but the digoxin level should be checked. Rate control measures should be continued to prevent further complications.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has fluctuating mental status, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or medication effects. Close monitoring and assessment of her mental status are essential to identify any acute changes or deterioration.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure"
