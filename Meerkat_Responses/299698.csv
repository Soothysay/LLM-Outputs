   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure, multifactorial: severe restrictive physiology
   due to pleural plaques (asbestos hx), aspiration pna, mental status,
   pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema and respiratory/muscle weakness
    - will cont vanc/cef for aspiration pna
    - wean sedating medications after MRCP
   2. Mental status changes/bulbar muscle weakness:
     - pt with possible progressive neuromuscular weakness, with increased
   dysphagia, altered mental status of unclear etiology, neurology
   following
    - will continue sedation with propofol, fentanyl for pain control as
   needed, consider seroquel if significant agitation when off propofol
    - trial off propofol once he is more hemodynamically stable
   3. Tremor: pt with intermittent shaking, rigidity, appears most
   consistent with pain/discomfort from ett
    - neuro eval with little evidence for seizure activity
    - Fentanyl as needed for pain control (on propofol will turn off
   Fentanyl gtt and give boluses as needed)
   4. Cardiomyopathy: recent DES on asa/plavix, has evidence of posterior
   wall motion abnormalities with likely further stenosis, intervention
   deferred for now per cardiology
    - cont diltiazem for HR control to allow forward flow
    - would avoid vasoconstrictor pressors (ie vasopressin) for now
    - cont asa/plavix
    - holding systemic a/c as he may require further procedures
   5. Pneumonia: copious secretions during bronchoscopy iwth increased
   wbc, but afebrile, may reflect upper airway drainage, on top of poor
   pulmonary reserve (pleural plaques and chronic aspiration)
    - f/u sputum culture
    - cont vanc/cefepime
    - pulmonary toilet
   6. Pancreatic mass:
    - family now aware
    - incidental finding in setting of addl workup, mass of unclear
   significance
    - he will need mrcp but biopsy contra-indicated in setting of
   asa/plavix
    - will defer MRCP for now given overall hemodynamic instability
   7. Gastric ulcer:
    - f/u H pylori
    - cont ppi
    - f/u pathology
    - will need rx for hpylori
   8. Atrial flutter: s/p failed ablation/cardioversion
    - cont dilt for flutter
   9. Dysphagia, oral weakness:
    - cont tube feeds for now, may eventually need tpn
   10. CAD s/p stent:
    - asa/plavix/statin
    - holding systemic a/c for now
   11. FEN: tube feeds for now, consider TPN pending w/u additional
   studies

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing severe restrictive physiology due to pleural plaques (asbestos history), aspiration pneumonia, mental status changes, pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, and respiratory/muscle weakness. Weaning sedating medications and providing respiratory support may be necessary.

2. Mental status changes/bulbar muscle weakness: The patient has progressive neuromuscular weakness with increased dysphagia and altered mental status of unclear etiology. Sedation with propofol and fentanyl for pain control may be needed. Consideration for seroquel if significant agitation when off propofol should be taken.

3. Tremor: The patient has intermittent shaking and rigidity, which appears most consistent with pain/discomfort from the endotracheal tube. A neuro evaluation is recommended with little evidence for seizure activity. Fentanyl as needed for pain control should be provided.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has evidence of posterior wall motion abnormalities with likely further stenosis. Intervention has been deferred for now per cardiology. Continuing diltiazem for HR control to allow forward flow is advised. Avoiding vasoconstrictor pressors (e.g., vasopressin) for now is recommended. Continuing ASA/PLAVIX is necessary.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has copious secretions"

The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/44 mmHg to 142/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the overnight transition from pressure support ventilation (PSV) to assisted control ventilation (ACV) due to hypoventilation. The patient's medical history includes allergies to sulfanilamide and digoxin, and last doses of antibiotics were cefepime and vancomycin. The patient is receiving several medications including midazolam, phenylephrine, pantoprazole, diltiazem, paroxetine, simvastatin, neo, albuterol, and carafate. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased potassium, and other abnormal values. The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, muscle wasting, right lower extremity edema, warm skin, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, pneumonia, pancreatic mass, gastric ulcer, atrial flutter, dysphagia, oral weakness, and coronary artery disease with stenting. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is sedated. Their vital signs show tachycardia and slightly low blood pressure. They have fluid balance issues, with a positive fluid balance since the last measurement. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to ongoing respiratory support and potential complications from aspiration pneumonia and pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may develop further complications from pneumonia, including worsening lung function and potential sepsis.
3. Pancreatic Mass: The presence of a pancreatic mass could lead to complications such as pancreatitis or further spread of the disease.
4. Gastric Ulcer: The patient's gastric ulcer may worsen and potentially lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter could progress and cause cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Dysphagia and Oral Weakness: The patient's dysphagia and oral weakness may result in complications related to feeding and"

    - wean sedating medications after MRCP
   2. Mental status changes/bulbar muscle weakness:
     - pt with possible progressive neuromuscular weakness, with increased
   dysphagia, altered mental status of unclear etiology, neurology
   following
    - will continue sedation with propofol, fentanyl for pain control as
   needed, consider seroquel if significant agitation when off propofol
    - trial off propofol once he is more hemodynamically stable
   3. Tremor: pt with intermittent shaking, rigidity, appears most
   consistent with pain/discomfort from ett
    - neuro eval with little evidence for seizure activity
    - Fentanyl as needed for pain control (on propofol will turn off
   Fentanyl gtt and give boluses as needed)
   4. Cardiomyopathy: recent DES on asa/plavix, has evidence of posterior
   wall motion abnormalities with likely further stenosis, intervention
   deferred for now per cardiology
    - cont diltiazem for HR control to allow forward flow
    - would avoid vasoconstrictor pressors (ie vasopressin) for now
    - cont asa/plavix
    - holding systemic a/c as he may require further procedures

   wbc, but afebrile, may reflect upper airway drainage, on top of poor
   pulmonary reserve (pleural plaques and chronic aspiration)
    - f/u sputum culture
    - cont vanc/cefepime
    - pulmonary toilet

    - family now aware
    - incidental finding in setting of addl workup, mass of unclear
   significance
    - he will need mrcp but biopsy contra-indicated in setting of
   asa/plavix

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have respiratory failure due to severe restrictive physiology caused by pleural plaques, aspiration pneumonia, mental status changes, pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, and respiratory/muscle weakness. The patient also has mental status changes/bulbar muscle weakness, tremor, cardiomyopathy, pneumonia, pancreatic mass, gastric ulcer, atrial flutter, dysphagia, oral weakness, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with stenting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe restrictive physiology and underlying conditions may lead to ongoing respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of chronic aspiration increases the risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia, which if left untreated, can worsen their respiratory status.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can compromise respiratory function.
5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's recent diagnosis of cardiomyopathy increases the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Pancreatic mass: The incidental finding of a pancreatic mass requires further evaluation and management, considering its potential implications.
7. Gastric ulcer: The patient's gastric ulcer needs appropriate treatment and follow-up to prevent complications like bleeding or perforation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and septic shock secondary to a pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, digoxin, and unknown allergens. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics including cefipime, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. 

The patient experienced episodes of diffuse shaking motions and facial grimace, but EEG results were negative for seizure activity. The patient also had atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response after morning suctioning, which was treated with fentanyl, ativan, and diltiazem. The patient's heart rates decreased overnight and was weaned off diltiazem.

The patient's temperature is elevated at 100.6°F, and panculture was ordered. The patient is not on anticoagulation due to possible procedures and is holding coumadin. 

The patient is receiving several infusions including phenylephrine, propofol, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and diltiazem. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Flow sheet data shows that the patient's vital signs are within normal range except for blood pressure, which is on the lower side. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 7 mmHg and fluid balance indicating an input of 2,906 mL with an output of 1,140 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation. The patient's ABG results are within normal limits.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has hypotension, atrial flutter, respiratory failure, and a history of pancreatic pseudocyst. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and clinical symptoms is necessary.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response indicates potential cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is essential.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation. Monitoring of respiratory parameters, such as oxygen saturation and ventilation levels, is crucial.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and fluctuating blood pressure require close monitoring of hemodynamic status to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
5. Pancreatic pseudocyst complications: The patient's history of pancreatic pseudocyst increases the risk of complications such as bleeding or rupture. Regular imaging and monitoring of symptoms related to the pseudocyst are necessary.
6. Medication interactions: The patient's complex medication regimen may increase the risk of drug interactions and adverse effects. Regular review of medications and adjustment as needed are necessary."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial flutter (AFLUTTER), and pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient was admitted to the ICU after developing respiratory distress following extubation post-general anesthesia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent surgery and oversedation have led to respiratory arrest. It is important to avoid volume overload during the periextubation period and reassess for extubation after imaging.

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has shown signs of infection, and the current antibiotics may need to be changed. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) gram stain and sputum culture should be sent for further evaluation.

3. Pancreas Mass: An MRCP should be performed for better characterization of the pancreatic mass. This will help guide further management and treatment options.

4. Gastric Ulcer: A biopsy and H. pylori test are pending. Treatment for H. pylori should be considered, and a PPI IV should be continued. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels is also important.

5. Atrial Flutter (AFLUTTER): The patient's atrial flutter should be evaluated by an outpatient cardiologist for potential ablation. Currently, the patient is on diltiazem for rate control, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, dysphagia, weight loss, and a dilated proximal esophagus. He was admitted to the ICU after developing respiratory distress during extubation post-general anesthesia. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial flutter, pancreatic pseudocyst, and gastric ulcer. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Arrest: The patient experienced respiratory arrest likely due to oversedation following surgery. The plan is to allow sedation to metabolize and keep the patient intubated overnight on pressure support ventilation (PSV) if tolerated. Light sedation with fentanyl and versed will be given as needed, and the patient will be assessed for extubation in the morning.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has developed HAP, and the antibiotics were changed from clindamycin to cefepime/vancomycin. Further evaluation with a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) gram stain and culture, as well as sputum culture, is planned.
3. Pancreas Mass: An MRCP is needed for better characterization of the pancreatic mass. The procedure will be attempted while the patient is intubated.
4. Gastric Ulcer: Biopsy and H. pylori testing are pending. Treatment for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of asbestos exposure, coronary artery disease, recent drug-eluting stent placement, atrial flutter after failed cardioversion and ablation, recurrent aspiration with microaspiration syndrome changes, weakness, progressive shortness of breath for months, and recent gastric ulcer. He was admitted for consideration of additional stenting and treatment for presumed pneumonia. However, the procedure for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement was canceled due to the discovery of a gastric ulcer. The patient remains hypotensive on pressors and has been extubated and reintubated. He is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics (cefipime, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam). His vital signs are unstable with fever, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He is also experiencing muscle wasting, right lower extremity edema, and decreased tone. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a history of celiac disease and pancreatic mass. Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural plaques and a patulous large esophagus.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation/flutter (Afib/Aflutter), pancreatic pseudocyst, and gastric ulcer. The patient was admitted to the ICU after developing respiratory distress during extubation post-general anesthesia.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status (not delirium), hypotension (not shock), atrial flutter (AFLUTTER), and respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The respiratory failure is related to mental status depression, possibly due to propofol and slow awakening.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require further evaluation and management. These include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by mental status depression and the effects of propofol. Close monitoring and adjustment of sedation levels are necessary. An MRI brain should be done to rule out anoxic brain injury or other neurological causes.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP treatment. Further follow-up with BAL gram stain and sputum culture is needed to guide antibiotic therapy.
3. Pancreas Mass: An MRI read is pending for further evaluation of the pancreas mass.
4. Gastric Ulcer: Biopsy and H. pylori testing are pending to determine the cause of the gastric ulcer. Continuing proton pump inhibitor"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES), asbestosis with pleural plaques, recurrent aspiration, and attempted percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient has been transferred to the ICU after the attempted PEG placement. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to multifactorial causes including fibrotic lung disease/asbestosis, heart failure, and recurrent aspiration with likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient's mental status changes are difficult to assess due to sedating medications, but he appears to be waking up. An MRI obtained overnight showed no obvious abnormalities. The patient has a pancreatic mass/gastric ulcers, awaiting pathology results from gastric biopsy, and a neurodegenerative process, to be followed up with neurology regarding overall work-up. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines (multi-lumen and arterial line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia), and reevaluation of the need for restraints. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES), asbestosis with pleural plaques, recurrent aspiration, and previous attempted percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient was transferred to the ICU after the attempted PEG placement. 

The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including fibrotic lung disease, heart failure, recurrent aspiration, and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient's mental status changes are difficult to assess due to sedating medications, but it appears that the patient is waking up. An MRI was obtained overnight with no obvious abnormalities. 

There are concerns regarding a pancreatic mass/gastric ulcers, and pathology results from a gastric biopsy are pending. There is also a suspected neurodegenerative process, and a follow-up with neurology is planned. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition and glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and a 20-gauge line. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is being provided.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation/flutter (Afib/Aflutter), dysphagia, and weight loss. He was admitted to the ICU after developing respiratory distress during extubation following general anesthesia. The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including respiratory failure related to mental status depression, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), suspected pancreatic mass, gastric ulcer, atrial flutter, dysphagia/oral weakness, neurologic decline, pulmonary fibrosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may be related to mental status depression. It is important to continue monitoring his oxygenation and ventilation status closely.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is already on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Further evaluation and treatment should be based on the results of the BAL gram stain and sputum cultures.
3. Suspected Pancreatic Mass: The patient has a dilated duct seen on MRCP, but no pancreatic mass was detected. Further evaluation and discussion with GI regarding recommendations for tissue diagnosis and nutrition for failed PEG tube are necessary.
4. Gastric Ulcer: The patient has an ongoing gastric ulcer, and biopsy and H. pylori testing are pending. Follow-up with the results of the MRCP and biopsy is important"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation/flutter (Afib/Aflutter), dysphagia, and weight loss. He was admitted to the ICU after developing respiratory distress following general anesthesia. The patient has several medical conditions including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), delirium, potential pancreas mass, gastric ulcer, atrial fibrillation/flutter, dysphagia/oral weakness, neurologic decline (Multiple Systems Atrophy and possible Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease), and coronary artery disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient still has a fair amount of secretions, which can increase the risk of further respiratory infections. It is important to continue frequent suctioning and complete the 10-day course of zosyn antibiotics.

2. Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to medications, infection, and the ICU stay. Minimizing sedating medications and removing lines/tubes whenever possible, along with reorientation, can help manage this condition.

3. Neurologic decline: The patient's neurologic decline may be attributed to multiple systems atrophy and malnutrition. Close monitoring and following up with neurology recommendations are important.

4. Gastric ulcer: The patient has a gastric ulcer, and biopsy results for H. pylori are pending. If positive, appropriate treatment should be initiated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation/Flutter, dysphagia, weight loss, and a dilated proximal esophagus. He was admitted to the ICU after developing respiratory distress in the setting of extubation post-general anesthesia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and mental status depression. He is currently on propofol and slow to wake up. There is a plan for a trial extubation today if he is not going for ERCP/further procedures. Possible anoxic brain injury from intermittent low blood pressures around the time of surgery should be considered.

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has pneumonia, and antibiotics (vanc and zosyn) have been continued. Further evaluation with BAL gram stain and sputum culture is needed.

3. Pancreas Mass: The patient has a dilated duct on MRCP but no pancreatic mass. Further evaluation for studies and nutrition for a failed PEG tube is recommended. An ERCP consult for tissue diagnosis may be considered if the family wants to pursue diagnosis.

4. Gastric Ulcer: A gastric ulcer is present, and biopsy and H. pylori testing are pending. MRCP results should be followed up.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial flutter, asbestosis, and aspiration, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He was successfully extubated and is showing improvement in mental status. The patient's allergies include sulfanilamide, digoxin, and unknown medications. He has been receiving various antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin, as well as other ICU medications like pantoprazole, carafate, paroxetine, lipitor, albuterol, and diltiazem. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/64 mmHg to 172/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has been receiving hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. His physical examination shows wheezes in the left lower lung field, rhonchi, and evidence of muscle wasting. The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 284 K/uL, sodium level of 135 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. The patient's main medical issues include respiratory failure, neurologic decline, coronary artery disease, aspiration, hypotension, pancreatic mass, feeding tube placement, and gastric ulcers. The plan is to continue with chest physiotherapy, chest X-ray, suctioning as needed, antibiotics, tracheostomy placement, neurologic workup, cardiac medications, and management of other comorbidities. Potential medical complications may include worsening respiratory failure, further neurologic decline, cardiac events, aspiration pneumonia, and gastrointestinal bleeding."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation/flutter (Afib/Aflutter), and pancreatic pseudocyst. He was admitted to the ICU after developing respiratory distress following extubation post-general anesthesia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation and has shown some improvement in mental status. However, his condition deteriorated overnight, with intermittent desaturations, excessive secretions, and lethargy. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.26, indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient was subsequently placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP).

Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status declined, leading to respiratory failure. This could be due to underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pneumonia.
2. Gastric ulcer: A gastric biopsy revealed ulceration with regeneration and changes consistent with chronic gastritis. This could potentially lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, which may increase the risk of clot formation and subsequent embolic events.
4. Pancreatic pseudocyst: The patient has a history of pancreatic pseudocyst, which can cause abdominal pain and complications if it ruptures.
5. Delirium: The patient exhibits altered mental status, likely related to medications, infection, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and pancreatic pseudocyst. He presented to the ICU after developing respiratory distress following extubation post-general anesthesia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation, but his mental status has slightly improved. His hemoglobin concentration has increased from 24.4 to 27.7. A gastric biopsy showed ulceration with regeneration and changes consistent with chronic gastritis. The patient was thought to be stable for a callout to cardiology, but no beds were available. During the evening, the patient experienced intermittent desaturations, excessive secretions, more lethargy, and an ABG showing pH 7.26, PaCO2 82, and PaO2 52. The patient was then placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP). The family expressed concern about the decline in respiratory status, and a plan for a family meeting was discussed to discuss goals of care and long-term prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been declining, as indicated by intermittent desaturations and excessive secretions. The ABG results show a low pH, elevated PaCO2, and low PaO2, suggesting respiratory acidosis and inadequate oxygenation. This indicates a potential respiratory failure, which may require more aggressive respiratory support or intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, hypotension, atrial flutter, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pancreatic pseudocyst. He was placed on non-invasive ventilation but required bipap due to intermittent desaturations and excessive secretions. The patient's mental status improved in the morning but declined in the evening, prompting a discussion about goals of care and long-term prognosis with the family and cardiology team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, as indicated by the need for bipap support and an ABG showing a pH of 7.26, which suggests respiratory acidosis.
2. Infection: The presence of an ulcer with regeneration and changes consistent with chronic gastritis may indicate an underlying infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings have been consistently low, indicating potential hypotension.
4. Atrial flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, which can lead to complications such as decreased cardiac output and potential embolic events.
5. Pancreatic pseudocyst: The patient's history of pancreatic pseudocyst may contribute to his overall condition and could potentially lead to complications like pain, bleeding, or infection."

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and flutter. He presented with dysphagia, weight loss, and a dilated proximal esophagus. The patient was transferred to the ICU after developing respiratory distress during extubation following general anesthesia. He has been diagnosed with altered mental status, hypotension, atrial flutter, respiratory failure, and a history of pancreatic pseudocyst.

The patient's current condition includes intermittent desaturations, excessive secretions, lethargy, and an ABG showing pH 7.26, PaCO2 82, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 52. He is on non-invasive ventilation and has been placed on BIPAP. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/105 to 158/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%.

The patient has been started on vancomycin and other antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam. He has a history of allergies to sulfanilamide and digoxin. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise. These include potential respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation/flutter (Afib/Aflutter), and pancreatic pseudocyst, was admitted to the ICU after developing respiratory distress following extubation post-general anesthesia.
- The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, hypotension, and atrial flutter.
- He has a history of dysphagia and weight loss, with findings of a dilated proximal esophagus and pancreatic mass.
- The patient was placed on non-invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure, but his condition worsened, leading to the placement of bipap and the reintroduction of vancomycin.
- The patient's Hct levels have been stable, ranging from 24.4 to 27.7.
- Gastric biopsy showed ulceration with regeneration and changes consistent with chronic gastritis.
- The patient's respiratory status declined, with intermittent desaturations and excessive secretions. An ABG showed pH 7.26, PaCO2 82, and PaO2/FiO2 52.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113-158 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%.

   functional decline
   1. Goals of care: family meeting today to discuss further goals of
   care: continued medical work-up and management would require trach
   placement but would likely not reveal a reversible process, versus
   transitioning to comfort measures.  Further plan to be determined based
   on outcome of this meeting.  Will discuss with neuro service if there
   are any further studies such as a mestinon study that could potentially
   reveal a reversible neurologic process.  In the meantime, will continue
   supportive care, including medical management of atrial fibrillation.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M CAD s/p DES, pulmonary asbestosis, dilated esophagus,
   aspiration, now with worsening respiratory distress and overall
   functional decline
   1. Goals of care: family meeting today to discuss further goals of
   care: continued medical work-up and management would require trach
   placement but would likely not reveal a reversible process, versus
   transitioning to comfort measures.  Further plan to be determined based
   on outcome of this meeting.  Will discuss with neuro service if there
   are any further studies such as a mestinon study that could potentially
   reveal a reversible neurologic process.  In the meantime, will continue
   supportive care, including medical management of atrial fibrillation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous diagnosis of esophageal disease (DES), pulmonary asbestos, dilated esophagus, and aspiration. The patient is currently experiencing worsening respiratory distress and overall functional decline.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F), heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 148/55 to 114/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on bipap respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the left upper lobe and rhonchi bilaterally, indicating potential lung issues. There is also evidence of muscle wasting and decreased tone.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 296,000 cells/microliter, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 135 milliequivalents/liter, elevated creatinine at 2.1 milligrams/deliter, and low potassium at 3.9 milliequivalents/liter.

Radiological imaging shows bilateral pleural plaques, NG tube placement, and increased opacity in the left upper lobe consistent with mucus plugging.

The patient's current assessment includes worsening respiratory distress and overall functional decline. The plan involves a family meeting to discuss"
