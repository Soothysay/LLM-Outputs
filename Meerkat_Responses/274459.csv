","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and iron deficiency anemia, admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient presented with fatigue, leg weakness, leg cramps, and dark stools. He also reported anorexia and abdominal pain radiating to the back, but no vomiting or objective fevers. The patient's initial vital signs were T 98.7, P 89, 114/24 mmHg, RR 15, and 96% on RA. A Hct of 15.9 (baseline 35) was noted, and the patient received 2 liters of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Morphine was given for belly pain, and a CT abdomen/pelvis was performed, which showed no abnormalities. 

Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient remained hemodynamically stable but complained of abdominal pain and leg extremity pain. The EKG showed more ST depressions in V3-V6, and the patient received an additional 3 units of PRBCs with appropriate Hct bump. The patient's vital signs were stable, and he was receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) at 8 mg/hour and furosemide (Lasix) at 10:30 PM. Morphine sulfate was also administered at 12:15 AM.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and iron deficiency anemia. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and found to have elevated CPK levels and severe hypothyroidism. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient presents with melena, indicating an upper gastrointestinal bleed. However, there is also a possibility of a lower gastrointestinal bleed. Chronicity of the bleed is suggested by the patient's hemodynamic stability.
2. Peptic ulcer disease/gastritis: The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. These conditions can lead to further bleeding and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has severe hypothyroidism, which needs to be addressed with hormone replacement therapy. Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to various complications such as cardiovascular problems and mental health issues.
4. Myocardial ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin levels and ECG changes suggest possible myocardial ischemia. This could be related to the patient's anemia or renal failure.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The elevated CPK levels indicate a risk of rhabdomyolysis, which may be related to hypothyroid"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and iron deficiency anemia. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and melena for three days. The patient has been experiencing fatigue, leg weakness, and cramps. He also has abdominal pain that radiates to the back, anorexia, and no vomiting or objective fevers. In the emergency department, his temperature was 98.7°F, pulse rate was 89 beats per minute, blood pressure was 114/24 mmHg, respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. His hemoglobin concentration was 15.9% (baseline 35%) and received 2 units of packed red blood cells. He also received 2 mg of morphine for abdominal pain, and his creatinine level increased to 5.3 (baseline 2.6). The CT abdomen/pelvis showed cardiomegaly, atelectatic changes, a small liver, gallstones, atherosclerotic calcification on renal vessels, and mild ectasia of renal-Abd-Ao with no free air, acute pathology. The CXR revealed a small left pleural effusion. The ECG showed ST depressions in leads V3-V6.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pain control for acute and chronic pain.
2. Chronic renal failure.
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without acute exacerbation.
4. Chronic heart failure (CHF), systolic.
5. Other heart disease, ischemic.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), likely upper given melena though proximal lower bleed is possible.
7. Severe hypothyroidism.

The patient appears to be critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Prolonged gastrointestinal bleeding leading to hypovolemic shock.
- Complications related to chronic renal insufficiency, such as further deterioration of renal function or uremic toxins.
- Cardiac issues due to chronic heart failure and ischemic heart disease.
- Respiratory complications due to COPD and potential fluid overload.
- Hypothyroidism requiring immediate treatment.
- Rhabdomyolysis from the combination of renal failure and hypothyroidism.
- Acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
- Possible development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.
- Nutritional deficiencies due to poor oral intake.
- Possible development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessment and management of the patient's condition."

   #. Upper GI bleed: diff is broad, but likely PUD (duodenal given worse
   with food). Stable, requiring no transfusions.
   - appreciate GI recs -> continue PPI drip, f/u with GI in terms of
   scopes.  GI reviewed initial CT which reveals a deep ulcer, no
   diverticulum; states no further imaging needed.  Recommends further
   stay in ICU due to high risk of perforation.
   - continue IV PPI drip
   - check daily Hct
   - monitor for active bleeding
   - 2 large bore PIVs
   - received total of 4U pRBCs, responded appropriately, no more
   transfusions for now
   - advance to clears today
   - d/c antibiotics
   - serial belly exams
   - H.Pylori exam
   #. Bilat leg pain/ Elev CK: likely rhabdo [**2-7**] hypothyroidism. CK is
   still elevated, but slowly trending down.
   - TSH was >100, continue IV levothyroxine
   - f/u with endocrine recs
   - cautious hydration with IVF (NS) maintenance
   - consider continuing Bicarb
   - monitor volume status with hydration bc of h/o CHF (Lasix PRN)
   - Morphine PRN for pain
   #.  Acute on chronic renal failure: likely [**2-7**] rhabdo, [**Last Name (un) 8020**] prerenal
   component
   - IVF
   - FeUrea <35 indicates prerenal component
   - hold home lisinopril
   - contact home nephrologist who follows his renal failure for possible
   future dialysis
   #. Elev trop: TnT trending down. Diff incl ACS but likely demand
   ischemia in setting of ARF and rhabdo. Levels are stable.
   - f/u EKG (last night showed no acute changes)
   - on BB, holding ASA bc of bleed, holding statin bc of elev CK
   #. Metabolic acidosis: likely due to uremia, perhaps component of
   lactic acidosis
   - check lactate levels
   - hydration with IVF
   #. Chronic diastolic dysfunction:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), COPD, and now newly diagnosed hypothyroidism. He presented with acute anemia likely due to an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed a deep ulcer adjacent to the pylorus without active bleeding but with concerns for perforation. The procedure was aborted prior to evaluation of the duodenum. A subsequent abdominal X-ray showed no free air suggestive of perforation. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitor), levothyroxine (thyroid hormone), and Lasix (diuretic) as needed for volume status management. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is alert and oriented without acute distress. Physical examination findings include crackles at bilateral lung bases, a regular rhythm heart rate, distant heart sounds, and a 2/6 systolic murmur without radiation. Laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated troponin T levels, metabolic acidosis, and elevated CK-MB levels consistent with myocardial injury. Additional tests pending include urine culture and toxicology panel, as well as further evaluation of the patient's thyroid function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of upper GI bleed, which may lead to re-bleeding or perforation of the ulcer. Close monitoring for signs of active bleeding and perforation is necessary.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate AKI. Proper fluid management and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents are important to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK levels suggest ongoing muscle breakdown, which can lead to further kidney injury. Adequate hydration and pain management are crucial.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is significantly elevated, indicating untreated hypothyroidism. Ongoing monitoring of thyroid hormone levels and continuation of levothyroxine supplementation are necessary.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's low pH indicates metabolic acidosis, possibly due to lactic acidosis secondary to rhabdomyolysis and AKI. Monitoring lactate levels and ensuring proper hydration are essential.
6. Chronic diastolic dysfunction: The patient's history of CHF suggests impaired diastolic function. Close monitoring of fluid status and use"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure, COPD, and hypothyroidism. He presents with acute anemia likely due to an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. The patient underwent an endoscopic gastrointestinal (EGD) procedure, which revealed a possible deep ulcer adjacent to the pylorus. No bleeding was observed during the procedure, but there was concern for perforation. The EGD was aborted before evaluating the duodenum. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), which is likely causing the acute anemia. Continuous pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion has been recommended to manage the PUD. Further evaluation with an EGD is planned, along with monitoring for active bleeding and advancing to clear liquids today.
2. Elevated troponin levels: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. Further assessment with an EKG and cardiac enzyme markers is necessary to determine the cause.
3. Bilateral leg pain and elevated CK levels: These findings suggest rhabdomyolysis, which could be secondary to hypothyroidism. The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is significantly elevated, and levothyroxine therapy is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including acute anemia likely due to an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, acute on chronic renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and newly diagnosed hypothyroidism. 

The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to investigate the source of bleeding, which revealed a possible deep ulcer adjacent to the pylorus. No active bleeding was observed, but there was concern for perforation. The procedure was aborted before evaluating the duodenum. The attending physician recommended abdominal films and surgical evaluation due to the risk of perforation.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 54 to 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104 to 152 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 18 to 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly low, ranging from 36.4 to 36.5 degrees Celsius.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, indicating renal impairment. The white blood cell count is within normal range, but the hemoglobin concentration is low at 29.1 g/dL, indicating anemia. The troponin T level is elevated, suggesting possible cardiac involvement. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is greater than 100, indicating severe hypothyroidism."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a complex medical history including hypertension (HTN), heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), iron deficiency anemia, and severe hypothyroidism. 

The patient was admitted with GIB and acute exacerbation of CRI. He underwent an endoscopy which revealed a deep ulcer in the stomach. Surgery was consulted, and a multi-lumen central venous catheter was placed. The patient is being treated for severe hypothyroidism with IV levoxyl. 

His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/70 to 152/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL and a hematocrit of 21.5%. The white blood cell count is within normal range, but there is an elevated platelet count of 287,000/mm³. The creatinine level is elevated at 4.8 mg/dL, and the troponin-T level is elevated at 0.38 ng/mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of blood loss anemia, acute on chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, COPD, and iron deficiency anemia. The patient was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and found to have elevated CPK levels and severe hypothyroidism. 

During the ICU stay, the patient underwent an endoscopy that revealed a deep ulcer in the stomach without active bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels have remained stable, and pantoprazole infusion has been continued. There are concerns about the gastric ulcer's perfusion, but no free air was seen on the kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) imaging. The patient's abdomen examination is benign, and he has trace edema in both lower extremities. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and creatinine (Cr) levels. Troponin-T levels are within normal range. Other lab values indicate potential electrolyte imbalances and elevated lactic acid levels. Imaging reports show an endoscopy finding of a large deep ulcer in the stomach, a small pleural effusion, and full hilar vessels on chest X-ray. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Large deep ulcer seen on endoscopy, though without active bleeding."
