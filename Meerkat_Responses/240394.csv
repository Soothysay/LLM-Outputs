   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   67 year-old man with urinary retenetion, hydronephrosis, possible
   urosepsis.
   # Sepsis - probable urinary tract site.  CT abdomen and CXR without
   evidence of any other source.  Iniitally hypotensive requiring levophed
   but now off pressors.  Urine cx from OSH still pending.   Covered with
   Zosyn, Vanco.  No prior positive cultures in our system.
   - continue zosyn and vanc
   - plan to check vanc level and dose by level
   - continue with IVF to support BP
   - f/u OSH and [**Hospital1 19**] urine and blood cultures
   - f/u urology recs
   # Hydronephrosis and Elevated creatinine
 presented with
   hydronephrosis and elevated creatinine.  Creatinine improved with
   replacement of Foley and volume resuscitation.
   - continue to monitor BUN/creatinine daily
   - continue Foley; stop CBI
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 Likely secondary to post-obstructive diuresis and
   very high urine output. Sodium currently 153, from 146 yesterday and
   134 on admisison. 4.7 L fluid deficit.  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to altered
   mental status.
   - continue 125/h D5W with goal to bring serum Na to 140 in the next 24
   hours
   -  1200 recheck sodium
   -  continue q6h sodium checks.
   .
   # Dementia - chronic; need additional hx from NH, family
   # Prolonged coags:  INR 4.1 currently, had a GU bleed, now resolved.
   [**Male First Name (un) 1930**] Valve, goal 2.5-3.5
   4) Anemia - 2 Units Blood here for HCT 20, now 24. No further GU
   bleeding since in unit.
   - 1800 Hct
   5) Abdominal distention - no etiology obvious on CT. Will follow. Looks
   OK on exam today

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of urinary retention, which has led to hydronephrosis and possible urosepsis. He is currently in the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of chronic dementia and anemia secondary to blood loss. He presented with hypotension requiring levophed but is now off pressors. He has been covered with antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin) and his urine culture is still pending. The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. He also has hypernatremia likely due to post-obstructive diuresis and very high urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction indicates a potential life-threatening infection. Close monitoring and management of his vital signs, laboratory values, and response to antibiotics are crucial.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urinary retention and hydronephrosis suggest a possible UTI. Monitoring his urine output, urinalysis, and urine culture results is important for managing this condition.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he experiences further blood loss or if his chronic condition progresses. Monitoring his hemoglobin levels and providing appropriate transfusions if necessary is important.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels require careful management"

The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI), anemia secondary to blood loss, dementia, prolonged coagulation, and abdominal distention. The patient is currently receiving aggressive fluid repletion, weaning off Levophed, and being covered with Zosyn and Vancomycin for the UTI. The patient also requires additional history from the nursing home and family regarding the dementia. The patient's massive bleed from Foley has stopped after receiving 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Blood products are being administered to address the anemia, aiming for a hematocrit (HCT) level of 20. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/37 mmHg to 120/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on respiratory support and has an ABG result of ///23/. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is not assessed, skin examination is not assessed, and neurologic examination is also not assessed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of chronic dementia, prolonged coagulation, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient was started on presep catheterization, received 5 liters of fluids, and had weaning off levophed. The patient also experienced mild agitation, pulling at catheters, and was unable to sleep, so a low dose of Zyprexa was given. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which requires immediate attention and management.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient may have a urinary tract infection, indicated by the presence of a urinary catheter and potential signs of infection.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, which needs to be addressed with blood transfusion and further management.
4. Prolonged coagulation: The patient has prolonged coagulation, requiring close monitoring and appropriate management, especially considering the previous massive bleed from Foley.
5. Abdominal distention: The patient has abdominal distention with no obvious etiology on CT, which needs to be followed up.

Note: This summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   67 year-old man with urinary retenetion, hydronephrosis, possible
   urosepsis.
   # Sepsis - probable urinary tract site.  CT abdomen and CXR without
   evidence of any other source.  Iniitally hypotensive requiring levophed
   but now off pressors.  Urine cx from OSH still pending.   Covered with
   Zosyn, Vanco.  No prior positive cultures in our system.
   - continue zosyn and vanc
   - plan to check vanc level and dose by level
   - continue with IVF to support BP
   - f/u OSH and [**Hospital1 19**] urine and blood cultures
   - f/u urology recs
   # Hydronephrosis and Elevated creatinine
 presented with
   hydronephrosis and elevated creatinine.  Creatinine improved with
   replacement of Foley and volume resuscitation.
   - continue to monitor BUN/creatinine daily
   - continue Foley; stop CBI
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 Likely secondary to post-obstructive diuresis and
   very high urine output. Sodium currently 153, from 146 yesterday and
   134 on admisison. 4.7 L fluid deficit.  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to altered
   mental status.
   - continue 125/h D5W with goal to bring serum Na to 140 in the next 24
   hours
   -  1200 recheck sodium
   -  continue q6h sodium checks.
   .
   # Dementia - chronic; need additional hx from NH, family
   # Prolonged coags:  INR 4.1 currently, had a GU bleed, now resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with urinary retention, hydronephrosis, and possible urosepsis. He presented with sepsis, severe with organ dysfunction, urinary tract infection (UTI), and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient initially required vasopressor support but is now off pressors. He has been covered with Zosyn and Vancomycin, and urine and blood cultures from outside hospitals are pending.

The patient's assessment includes severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely secondary to a urinary tract infection. He also has acute anemia due to hemorrhage and blood loss. Other findings include hypernatremia, likely caused by post-obstructive diuresis and high urine output, as well as chronic dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications if not promptly treated.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The UTI may progress to urosepsis, leading to further systemic infection and complications.
3. Acute Anemia: The patient's acute anemia requires timely management to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues. If not corrected, it can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be carefully managed to prevent dehydration and potential neurological complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with presumed urosepsis, bilateral hydronephrosis, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been started on a pre-sep catheter, EKG, and weaned off levophed. The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and unknown allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on [**2144-3-16**] at 04:40 PM and piperacillin on [**2144-3-17**] at 08:43 AM. The patient is receiving infusions of zosyn, zantac, and other ICU medications. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged from admission except for the noted changes.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 60 bpm (60-117 bpm), blood pressure of 86/37 mmHg (49) with a range of 86/30-120/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 inspiratory minutes (14-24), and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient has a first-degree AV block. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) is 79.2 L/min, and cardiac index (CI) is 37.9 L/min/m². Bladder pressure is 22 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is 95%. Fluid balance shows an input of 10,339 mL, including 838 mL of [**Year (2 digits) **] products, and output of 5,140 mL, including 2,300 mL of urine.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.7 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) of 166 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 87 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 4.6, glucose of 88 mg/dL, and other lab values. Imaging includes a clear chest X-ray (CXR) and a CT scan. Microbiology results are pending.

Assessment and plan include hypotension/shock, weaned off pressors with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 64; concern for urosepsis given neurogenic bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis on admission, no other clear source, clear CXR, and grossly positive urinalysis (U/A) but in the setting of hematuria. Continue intravenous fluids (IVF) if blood pressure drops.

Other assessments and plans include post-obstructive renal failure improving after IVF and decompression with clear urine, hypernatremia with a free water (FW) deficit of 5 L, continue D5W at 125/hr, likely secondary to post-obstructive/acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis. Hematuria is noted but no further action is taken at this time. Anemia is improving after receiving 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), and altered mental status is suspected to be secondary to hypernatremia, hypoperfusion, or toxic/metabolic factors.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (presep catheter), prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), and VAP precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition remains in the ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 40 minutes."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of dementia, neurogenic bladder, and acute renal failure with obstructive uropathy. The patient's current conditions include presumed urosepsis, bilateral hydronephrosis, and acute renal failure (ARF).

From the note, it can be summarized that the patient was admitted with acute renal failure with obstructive uropathy and hypotension. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or a combination of both. The low central venous pressure (CVP) suggests a component of hypovolemia. Appropriate volume resuscitation may be necessary.

2. Urosepsis: Given the patient's neurogenic bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis, there is a concern for urosepsis. This is supported by the grossly positive urinalysis (u/a) and hematuria. It is important to continue IV fluids and monitor for any signs of deterioration.

3. Post-obstructive renal failure: The patient had post-obstructive renal failure, which is improving after intravenous fluid (IVF) administration and decompression. Close monitoring of urine output is necessary.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with presumed urosepsis, bilateral hydronephrosis, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, kidney dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies reveal clear lungs on chest X-ray and a CT scan. The patient's microorganisms are pending analysis. The assessment and plan include managing hypotension, post-obstructive renal failure, hypernatremia, hematuria, anemia, aspiration risk, and altered mental status. The patient's ICU care involves nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and medication administration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presumed urosepsis indicates an existing infection that can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's ARF suggests impaired kidney function, which may worsen without appropriate intervention.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates inadequate perfusion,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of transient hypotension while sleeping, which was responsive to fluids. The patient has an allergy to sulfa antibiotics and has received vancomycin and piperacillin within the last 24 hours. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/55 to 120/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient has a first-degree AV block and central venous pressure within normal limits. Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,253 mL and output of 2,990 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,263 mL. The patient requires respiratory support with an ABG showing a pH of 7.26. Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral pulses, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination not assessed. Lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, renal dysfunction, electrolyte abnormalities, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's blood cultures were positive for gram-positive rods. The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, urinary tract infection, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and other complications. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

The physical examination revealed a first-degree AV block, and the patient's peripheral vascular pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments were not evaluated. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, increased creatinine, and high sodium levels. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, likely secondary to a urinary tract infection, acute anemia, and hypernatremia. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin), intravenous fluids, and blood transfusion. Further plans include checking Vancomycin levels, monitoring BUN and creatinine daily, continuing Foley catheterization, rechecking sodium levels, and evaluating for any potential complications related to prolonged coagulation time and dementia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of urogenic bladder and dementia, admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis. The patient presented with obstructive uropathy leading to acute renal failure, hematuria, and acute blood loss anemia. Over the past day, the patient's blood pressure has gradually improved, and there has been an improvement in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and mental status. The patient's hypernatremia has also improved with the administration of free water.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UTI/sepsis: The patient may continue to experience complications related to the ongoing infection, despite no recoverable organisms being found in the cultures. It is important to complete the planned 14-day course of antibiotics to prevent further spread of the infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may recur due to a combination of hypovolemia and sepsis. Close monitoring of the patient's MAP is crucial to detect any potential drops in blood pressure.
3. ARF/Obstructive uropathy/hydronephrosis: The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is associated with obstructive uropathy and hydronephrosis. Monitoring the patient's creatinine levels is essential to assess the progress of kidney function recovery. Controlling the Foley catheter and planning for a suprapubic catheter placement are necessary to prevent further complications.
