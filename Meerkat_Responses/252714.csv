   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea and worsening heart failure by
   history. Other considerations include pneumonia, ACS, PE. Symptoms and
   oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Patient with crackles and JVD
   on exam, although no dependent edema. The dose of levofloxacin she
   received in the ED will provide adequate coverage until tomorrow, given
   her degree of renal insufficiency.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of renal transplant, mitral regurgitation, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), coronary artery disease (CAD), and diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath and was found to have crackles and jugular venous distention (JVD) on examination. Her symptoms and oxygenation improved with diuresis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include worsening heart failure, pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary embolism (PE), and renal insufficiency. 

Please note that the patient's condition should be closely monitored for any changes in respiratory status, electrolyte imbalances, and renal function. Additionally, cardiac enzymes should be cycled, and consideration should be given to consulting cardiac surgery."

On examination, the patient has crackles and jugular venous distention (JVD) on exam, although no dependent edema. Her cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no active myocardial infarction. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level.

The patient's treatment plan includes:
1. IV diuretics with additional 80 mg IV Lasix to manage heart failure and pulmonary congestion.
2. Continuing home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload.
3. Cycling cardiac enzymes to monitor for any changes.
4. Considering consulting cardiac surgery.
5. Checking D-dimer to rule out pulmonary embolism.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post kidney transplant, and mitral regurgitation. She presents with acute onset shortness of breath and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with heart failure, both systolic and diastolic, and is experiencing hypotension and acute renal failure. She also has a history of recent hospitalization for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's history of heart failure and current symptoms of shortness of breath and crackles on examination indicate a potential worsening of her heart failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's increasing creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which may be secondary to overdiuresis or hypotension.
3. Infection: The patient has an active infection due to septic arthritis of her left ankle. She is currently receiving vancomycin as part of her antibiotic regimen.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and recent cardiac intervention increase her risk for arrhythmias. Although her current EKG shows sinus rhythm, ongoing monitoring is necessary.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's shortness of breath and bibasilar crackles could indicate pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held yesterday as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then
   developed worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100
   mg lasix last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles
   or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as
   do not think the patient is infected.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who underwent a living-related kidney transplant in October. She presents with acute onset shortness of breath, which is likely due to decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to worsening mitral regurgitation. Oxygenation has improved with diuresis, and crackles and jugular venous distention (JVD) are no longer present on examination. The patient's creatinine level is improving with diuresis. There are no signs of renal transplant failure, and the renal ultrasound with Doppler is normal. The patient has a history of recent septic arthritis of the left ankle, but films of the ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomyelitis. She also has a history of mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. The patient's anemia is currently at baseline, and her diabetes is stable. She is on a low-sodium diet and takes medications for depression, pain control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of recent septic arthritis of the left ankle, and there is a concern for possible osteomyelitis. A bone biopsy is planned today to rule out infection.
2. Mitral valve replacement: The patient's worsening"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held yesterday as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then
   developed worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100
   mg lasix last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles
   or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as
   do not think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - f/u cardiac surgery consult
   - f/u D-dimer
   - optimal HR and afterload reduction
   # ? Osteomyelitis: Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No
   fevers or white count. Ortho is taking to OR today for biopsy to r/o
   infection.
   - F/u CRP/ESR
   - Bone biopsy today by ortho
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue vanc
   - Check daily vanc level
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. As above, we will diurese with IV
   Lasix (80 mg boluses), with close attention to respiratory status,
   electrolytes and renal funciton. D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] and CT surgery.
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **]. Pending decision for MV replacement, pt will need left
   coronary cath prior to procedure.
   - Would hold on diuresis on day of MVR surgery to protect kidneys
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath, most likely, prior to valvular replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.  Films
   of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomylitis
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Orthopedic surgery taking to OR today
   - ID consulted (appreciate recs)
   .
   # Anemia. Currently at baseline.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit
   .
   # Diabetes, insulin dependent. Stable. No active issues.
   - Glargine per home regimen: 22u qhs
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Depression. No active issues.
   - continue home Wellbutrin and citalopram
   .
   # FEN. Diabetic, heart-healthy, low-sodium diet.
   # Access. Right-sided PICC line.
   # Prophylaxis. HSQ, bowel regimen, PPI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, and mitral regurgitation. She presents with acute onset shortness of breath and is currently in the ICU. The patient's symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. She was initially held on Lasix yesterday as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed worsening O2 requirement and was given a dose of 100 mg Lasix last night with 2 L urine output. The patient no longer has crackles or jugular venous distention (JVD) on examination. O2 requirement is decreasing as well.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a non-united, persistently distracted medial malleolar fracture with cortical irregularity, making it difficult to exclude osteomyelitis. A bone biopsy is planned today to rule out infection.
2. Heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to worsening CHF. She is being closely monitored and managed with diuretics to maintain even to slightly negative fluid output.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea and worsening heart failure by
   history. Other considerations include pneumonia, ACS, PE, along with
   sleep apnea. Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis.
   Patient with crackles and JVD on exam, although no dependent edema. The
   dose of levofloxacin she received in the ED will provide adequate
   coverage until tomorrow, given her degree of renal insufficiency.
   - IV diuresis with additional 80 mg IV Lasix
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider consulting cardiac surgery
   - check D-dimer
   .
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. As above, we will diurese with IV
   Lasix (80 mg boluses), with close attention to respiratory status,
   electrolytes and renal funciton. D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] and CT surgery.
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **]. Desire panorex and coronary cath prior to procedure.
   .
   # Hypotension and acute renal failure.
   Interval decrease in BP
 non-symptomatic, but in 80s and creatinine
   increased. Likely overdiuresed last night.
   - Hold diuresis from this a.m. and re-evaluuate.
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need cath, most likely, prior to valulaer replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine was at recent baseline on admission
   and slightly increased this a.m. Possibly secondary to overdiuresis or
   hypotension. During the previous admission, the patient's creatinine
   was noted to rise after she had been found to have an undetectable
   tacrolimus level. She had been treated briefly with pulse-dose
   steroids, renal ultrasound was unremarkable, and she was rapidly
   tapered off of steroids.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - renal ultrasound with Doppler
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Call orthopedic surgery/hand today (hold off on ID for now)
   .
   # Anemia. Currently at baseline.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit
   .
   # Diabetes, insulin dependent. Stable. No active issues.
   - Glargine per home regimen: 22u qhs
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Depression. No active issues.
   - continue home Wellbutrin and citalopram

","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She presents with acute onset shortness of breath.

The patient's current medications include home blood pressure regimen, levofloxacin, intravenous diuretics (Lasix), aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, prednisone, and Tacrolimus. She also has a pain regimen for her recent septic arthritis of the left ankle.

The patient's physical examination reveals a cachectic appearance, jugular venous distention (JVD), bibasilar crackles, and a holosystolic blowing murmur consistent with known mitral regurgitation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 138/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm on electrocardiogram (EKG).

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 25.3 g/dL, platelet count of 346 K/uL, creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 145 mg/dL, and sodium of 133 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is slightly elevated, which may be due to overdiuresis or hypotension.

The patient's imaging studies reveal no hydronephrosis and no perinephric fluid collection on renal ultrasound. Her knee and ankle films show no effusion and no acute fracture. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no ongoing myocardial infarction.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for shortness of breath, likely orthopnea and worsening heart failure. The patient is diuresed with additional 80 mg IV Lasix, and close attention is given to respiratory status, electrolytes, and renal function. The patient is also evaluated for possible pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary embolism (PE), and sleep apnea.

The patient's medical complications include worsening heart failure, mitral regurgitation, hypotension, acute renal failure, recent septic arthritis of the left ankle, anemia, diabetes mellitus type 1, depression, and hyperglycemia. The patient requires close monitoring and management of her cardiovascular status, renal function, electrolyte balance, and pain control."

   Fluid analysis / Other labs: None.
   Imaging: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.

   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on
   exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not
   think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - f/u cardiac surgery consult
   - f/u D-dimer
   - optimal HR and afterload reduction
   # ? Osteomyelitis: Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No
   fevers or white count. Ortho is taking to OR today for biopsy to r/o
   infection.
   - F/u CRP/ESR
   - Bone biopsy today by ortho
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue vanc
   - Check daily vanc level
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. Patient appears euvolemic after
   diuresis with [**Hospital1 **] IV lasix.  Patient looks so well clinically that it
   may be best to wait a little while for the MV replacement given her
   recent leg ulcer and acute episode of CHF and ARF.
   - will hold off on catheterization and valve surgery for 3 weeks
   - plan to have her return for outpatient catheterization and pre-op w/u
   in 2 weeks
   - restart home dose Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath, most likely, prior to valvular replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.  Films
   of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomylitis

   Imaging: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a medical history of renal transplant, mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild regional systolic dysfunction. The patient also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's inflammatory markers are normal, and tissue culture does not grow any organisms. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is on insulin therapy. The patient is receiving IV vancomycin for an infection, and his blood pressure is relatively low. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's inflammatory markers are normal, and tissue culture does not grow any organisms, indicating that the infection is under control. However, monitoring is still ongoing.

2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of chronic CHF, and the TEE showed mild regional systolic dysfunction. This could potentially worsen if the patient's cardiac function deteriorates further.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is relatively low, indicating hypotension. This may require close monitoring and appropriate management to ensure adequate perfusion and organ function.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating"

   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held yesterday as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then
   developed worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100
   mg lasix last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles
   or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as
   do not think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart

   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.

   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.

She was admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of heart failure. The patient's blood sugar was found to be high at 500 mg/dL, and she was given 14 units of Humalog. She requires consultation with a nephrologist on May 2nd regarding her vancomycin course and potential need for a repeat bone biopsy. The patient has allergies to codeine, amoxicillin, and adhesive tape. She is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium and has been receiving various ICU medications.

   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on
   exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not
   think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)

   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, and a history of mitral regurgitation with recent hospitalization for shortness of breath.

The patient's current presentation includes acute onset shortness of breath, which is likely due to decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). Her symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuretic therapy. Lasix was initially withheld as she was considered euvolemic, but she developed worsening oxygen requirements, and subsequently received a dose of 100 mg lasix last night with 2 L urine output. She no longer exhibits crackles or jugular venous distension (JVD) on examination. Oxygen requirements are decreasing as well.

The patient's medical team plans to continue diuresis/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc) output, restart home Lasix dose of 80 mg every other day, continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload, follow up with cardiac surgery consult, and repeat D-dimer. The patient appears euvolemic after diuresis with [**Hospital1 **] IV lasix and looks so well clinically that it may be best to wait a little while"

   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.
   CONSULTS:
   - per ID, patient can complete vancomycin course on [**5-2**] and should have
   repeat bone biopsy as outpatient (off antibiotics) versus suppressive
   antibiotics with minocycline or doxycycline for ""prolonged course"" ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   with 2 L urine output.  She has been converted to her home dose PO
   lasix.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement
   decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not think the patient is
   infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Home dose lasix was 80 mg Q every other day. However, this resulted
   in fluid retention requiring hospitalization.  Will plan to continue
   lasix 80 mg q day and follow Is/Os and creatinine
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   # ? Osteomyelitis: During her previous admission she was evaluated by
   the orthopedics service who felt that her left ankle was healing
   appropriately.  Films of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of
   osteomylitis.  Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No fevers
   or white count. Ortho performed biopsy to r/o osteomylitis and cultures
   have shown no growth to date.  However, this was performed on
   antibiotics.  ID recommends repeat biopsy off antibiotics versus
   prophylaxis with doxycycline or minocycline.  Last day vanc today.
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Would favor stopping antibiotics for one week and repeat biopsy so
   that patient does not have to be on maintenance antibiotics.  Would
   also like definitive answer regarding osteomylitis if we are
   considering a mitral valve replacement soon.
   - continue wound vac
   - will need f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 818**] next week and schedule OR for repeat
   bx
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. Patient appears euvolemic after
   diuresis with [**Hospital1 **] IV lasix.  Patient looks so well clinically we are
   waiting for MV replacement given her recent leg ulcer and acute episode
   of CHF and ARF.
   - will hold off on catheterization and valve surgery for 3 weeks
   pending no infection on repeat biopsy off antibiotics
   - plan to have her return for outpatient catheterization and pre-op w/u
   in 2 weeks
   - continue lasix 80 mg PO Q day
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath prior to valvular replacement (in 2 weeks pending
   repeat biopsy).
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Anemia. Currently at baseline.
   -          continue to trend daily hematocrit
   -          transfuse for < 27
   .
   # Diabetes, insulin dependent. Elevated blood glucose to 500 yesterday.
   - needs [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   .
   # Depression. No active issues.
   - continue home Wellbutrin and citalopram
   .
   # FEN. Diabetic, heart-healthy, low-sodium diet.

   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.
   CONSULTS:
   - per ID, patient can complete vancomycin course on [**5-2**] and should have
   repeat bone biopsy as outpatient (off antibiotics) versus suppressive
   antibiotics with minocycline or doxycycline for ""prolonged course"" ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   with 2 L urine output.  She has been converted to her home dose PO
   lasix.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement
   decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not think the patient is
   infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - f/u cardiac surgery consult
   - f/u D-dimer
   - optimal HR and afterload reduction
   # ? Osteomyelitis: Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No
   fevers or white count. Ortho is taking to OR today for biopsy to r/o
   infection.
   - F/u CRP/ESR
   - Bone biopsy today by ortho
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue vanc
   - Check daily vanc level
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. Patient appears euvolemic after
   diuresis with [**Hospital1 **] IV lasix.  Patient looks so well clinically that it
   may be best to wait a little while for the MV replacement given her
   recent leg ulcer and acute episode of CHF and ARF.
   - will hold off on catheterization and valve surgery for 3 weeks
   - plan to have her return for outpatient catheterization and pre-op w/u
   in 2 weeks
   - restart home dose Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath, most likely, prior to valvular replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.  Films
   of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomylitis
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Orthopedic surgery taking to OR today
   - ID consulted (appreciate recs)
   .
   # Anemia. Currently at baseline.
   -          continue to trend daily hematocrit
   -          transfuse for < 27
   .
   # Diabetes, insulin dependent. Elevated blood glucose to 500 yesterday.
   - needs [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   - Glargine per home regimen: 22u qhs
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Depression. No active issues.
   - continue home Wellbutrin and citalopram
   .
   # FEN. Diabetic, heart-healthy, low-sodium diet.
   # Access. Right-sided PICC line.
   # Prophylaxis. HSQ, bowel regimen, PPI.
   # Code. Full code, confirmed with the patient.
   # Contact. [**Name (NI) 16**] [**Name (NI) 11754**], mother/HCP, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10098**]; HCP was [**Name (NI) 420**]
   by phone and is aware of admission to CCU.
   # Disposition. CCU for now

","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, and a recent hospitalization for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient presents with acute onset shortness of breath.

She has been converted to her home dose PO lasix. She no longer has crackles or jugular venous distention (JVD) on exam. O2 requirement is decreasing as well. No antibiotics are being given as it is not thought that the patient is infected.

The plan is to continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc) output, clarify home lasix dose with mother and nephrologist, restart maintenance dose (80 mg Q every other day), continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload, follow up with cardiac surgery consult, f/u D-dimer, optimal HR and afterload reduction.
