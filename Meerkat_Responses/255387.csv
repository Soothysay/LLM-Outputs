   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell
   transplant in 05 presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR
   emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac
   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   .
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, may be due to acute upper
   airway swelling and hypoxia causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had
   rapid return of perfusing rhythm.  There was significant concern for
   initial poor neurologic status post code, however, pt has now had
   return of neuro function and following commands. Suspect that meds
   given peri code contributed to poor neuro status initially, now
   clearing.
   - replete lytes aggressively, status post aggressive Ca [**Last Name (LF) 375**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   follow-up repeat labs
   - neuro exams appear to be improving
   - no need for cooling currently
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidis. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may have
   pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have definite
   airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given mild e/o
   immunosuppression.
   - wean oxygen/PEEP as tolerated
   - continue aggressive suction
   - [**Month (only) 202**] RR to improve respiratory alkalosis
   - empiric Abx Vanc/Cefepime/Clinda/Doxy for any possible pericode &
   emergency trach aspiration
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   - NPO for now, SBT with trach collar in am
   .
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op
   - continue Vanc/Cefepime/clinda for skin flora and ?immunocomp state,
   will cover gram negatives until cultures return, then narrow Abx
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs, work up for atypical infections
   - f/u Vasc Surgery recs
   - dressing changes per Vasc
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Pt presented with hyponatremia of unclear etiology, may
   all be secondary to hypothyroidism.  Appears clinically euvolemic to
   hypervolemic currently, no prior h/o SIADH.  Pt having alot of urine
   output currently, it is possible that this hyponatremia & hypochloremia
   is due to volume overload.
   - continue NS IVF
   - serial lytes q6hrs
   - f/u urine lytes & osms
   - continue to treat hypothyroidism
   .
   # Multiple Myelomma: Pt has been on Revlimid which may have been
   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   - f/u Onc recs
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome with intracompartment abcess, now s/p fasciotomy
   - continue aggressive IVF, keep UOP>100cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine & f/u renal recs
   - continue local wound care per vasc
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated transaminases & elevated LDH in setting
   of acute rhabdo. Baseline LFTs normal.  Unclear if this is due to
   atypical infection vs acute rhabdo.
   - trend LFTs
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - f/u ID recs & atypical infection work up
   .
   # Anemia: Hct was 34.7 on admission, now down to 25. This is likely
   complicated by underlying abnormal bone marrow on revlimid for MM and
   intra-operative blood loss.
   - transfuse to maintain hct>25
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Pt profoundly hypothyroid with TSH>50 and low T4.
   This may be contributing to tongue swelling on admission.
   - apprec endo consult
   - continue Levothyroxine 200mg IV daily
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   - aggressive repletion of lytes
   .
   # Access: Right femoral line placed during code under non-sterile
   conditions, Left PIV and right arterial line.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current health status, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient had a cardiac arrest and required emergency tracheotomy. There is concern for possible aspiration pneumonia due to the tracheostomy and previous respiratory failure.

2. Compartment syndrome with abscess: The patient presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels, leading to an emergent fasciotomy. Frank pus was found in the compartments, indicating an abscess. This condition requires aggressive treatment with antibiotics and close monitoring for any signs of infection.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient presented with hyponatremia of unclear etiology. It may be secondary to hypothyroidism, which is being treated. Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is necessary.

4. Elevated CK/Rhabdomyolysis: The patient had elevated CK levels, likely secondary to compartment syndrome with intracompartmental abscess. Now that the fasciotomy has been performed, it is important to continue aggressive IV fluid administration to maintain urine output above 100 cc/hr and monitor creatinine levels.

5. LFT abnormalities: The patient has elevated transaminases and elevated LDH. These abnormalities could be due to atypical infection or acute rhabdomyolysis. Further evaluation and close monitoring of liver function tests are needed.

6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has"

   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   .
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, s/p epinephrine x1, CPR for 3
   minutes, may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia
   causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had rapid return of perfusing
   rhythm.  There was significant concern for initial poor neurologic
   status post code, however, pt has now had return of neuro function and
   following commands. Suspect that meds given peri code contributed to
   poor neuro status initially, now clearing.
   - replete lytes aggressively, now s/p mg and ca repletion, need to
   recheck post repletion lytes, pt is hyponatremic, unclear
   - serially neuro exams improving
   - would like to elucidate etiology of cardiac arrest better
 most
   likely etiology is hypoxia, with history of upper extremity swelling
   would consider allergy leading to angioedema would also consider PE as
   well as hypotension, sepsis
   - considered cooling overnight, deferred with improving neuro exam
   - epinephrine resuscitation can lead to hypotension, pulmonary edema
   - patient was hypotensive overnight, was given 1 unit of pRBCs
   overnight, will order another unit of pRBCs today
   - maintain MAP > 60 and maintain urine output > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidis. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may have
   pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have definite
   airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given mild e/o
   immunosuppression.
   - cont hypoxia may be secondary to atelectasis vs. fluid overload
   secondary to volume repletion vs. Pulmonary embolus
   - wean oxygen/PEEP as tolerated however gases have been limiting us
   overnight (mental status is not a barrier to extubation)
   - will bring PEEP to 10 this morning
   - echo today to rule out blown RV which might indicate PE to explain
   etiology of hypoxia
   - continue aggressive suction
   - decreased RR to improve respiratory alkalosis, new ph 7.44
   - empiric Abx Vanc/Cefepime/Clinda/Doxy for any possible pericode &
   emergency trach aspiration
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   - NPO for now, working on SBT with trach collar in AM
   .
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op
   - continue Vanc/Cefepime/clinda for skin flora and ?immunocomp state,
   will cover gram negatives until cultures return, then narrow Abx
   - appreciate ID recs
 ID thinks that this might be a global process,
   reccomending west [**Doctor First Name **] serologies, stool enterovirus, ebv viral load,
   ebv, cmv, hav, hbv, hcv, lyme [**Doctor Last Name 376**] serologies  - HIV testing
   then consider viral load, also MRI
   - if goes to OR would consider muscle biopsy, repeat bacterial cx,
   viral cv
   - f/u cultures, try to get viral cx
   - dressing changes per Vascular
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Pt presented with hyponatremia of unclear etiology, may
   all be secondary to hypothyroidism.  Appears clinically euvolemic to
   hypervolemic currently, no prior h/o SIADH.  Pt having alot of urine
   output currently, it is possible that this hyponatremia & hypochloremia
   is due to volume overload.
   - continue NS IVF

   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   - f/u Onc recs
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome with intracompartment abcess, now s/p fasciotomy
   - continue aggressive IVF, keep UOP>100cc/hr

   - continue local wound care per vasc

   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated transaminases & elevated LDH in setting
   of acute rhabdo. Baseline LFTs normal.  Unclear if this is due to
   atypical infection vs acute rhabdo. Suspect that may continue to worsen
   today as patient is s/p cardiac arrest.
   - trend LFTs
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - f/u ID recs & atypical infection work up
   .
   # Anemia: Hct was 34.7 on admission, now down to 21. s/p 1 unit
   transfusion overnight.This is likely complicated by underlying abnormal
   bone marrow on revlimid for MM and intra-operative blood loss.
   - will transfuse another unit this AM, re-check crit and consider

   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, may be due to acute upper
   airway swelling and hypoxia causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had
   rapid return of perfusing rhythm.  There was significant concern for
   initial poor neurologic status post code, however, pt has now had
   return of neuro function and following commands. Suspect that meds

   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with

   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma who presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels, leading to an emergency fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome. He then experienced cardiac arrest and required an emergency tracheostomy. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, compartment syndrome with abscess, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, anemia, elevated CK levels, LFT abnormalities, and hypothyroidism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to airway swelling and hypoxia causing cardiac arrest, as well as negative inspiratory pressure pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of oxygenation and weaning from ventilation is necessary.
2. Compartment Syndrome with Abscess: The patient has undergone surgical intervention with fasciotomy and found pus in the compartments. Cultures were sent, and antibiotics are being administered to cover skin flora and potential immunocompromised state.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient presented with hyponatremia of unclear etiology, which may be secondary to hypothyroidism. Aggressive repletion of sodium is needed, along with serial electrolyte monitoring.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient is profoundly hypothyroid with elevated TSH and low T4 levels. An endocrine consult is required, and Levothyroxine 200mg IV daily should be continued.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, hypertension, and hypercholesteremia. He presented to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest and respiratory failure, requiring emergent tracheostomy. He was initially unresponsive and severely hypoxic but showed improvement overnight. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure/Post-cardiac arrest: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to airway compromise in the peri-operative period. The plan is to wean FiO2 and PEEP while continuing bronchodilators.
2. Hypotension: The cause of the patient's hypotension is unclear, but it could be related to an underlying infection or post-arrest physiology. An echocardiogram (ECHO) has been ordered to evaluate right ventricular function, and treatment for the underlying infection is planned.
3. Sepsis/Abscess: The patient has sepsis likely due to an abscess. Antibiotics (Vanc/Cefepime/Clinda/doxycycline) have been started.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, and further evaluation of urine electrolytes, normal saline administration, and sodium monitoring is planned.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient may have rhabdomyolysis, and follow-up of CPK levels and IV fluid"

   5)       Hypothyroid: on synthroid
   6)       FEN: NGT and tube feeds
   Addendum: Right leg pain developed during the day and ultimately found
   to have high compartment pressures and required return to the operating
   room.  Similar findings to yesterday.  Overall, I believe the process
   is likely rhabdo secondary to statins possibly with a component or
   predisposition from hypothyroidism.  Given worsening condition and
   rising CPK, will continue IVFs and alkanalize the urine.

The patient presented from the operating room after experiencing cardiac arrest and respiratory failure, requiring emergent tracheostomy. Initially, the patient had left leg pain and underwent a fasciotomy, with pus found in the area.

The patient's initial presentation to the ICU included severe hypoxia and unresponsiveness. Overnight, the patient's oxygenation improved, along with mental status. The patient received IV fluids overnight. 

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
- Heart rate: 69 bpm
- Blood pressure: 108/62 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is mechanically ventilated through a tracheostomy tube with settings including a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, PEEP at 12 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute.

Physical examination findings include an overweight/obese appearance, tracheostomy in place, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and distended abdomen. Neurologic examination was not assessed due to the patient's sedation and mechanical ventilation"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, tracheostomy, and rhabdomyolysis in the setting of bilateral compartment syndrome. The patient returned to the operating room for elevated compartment pressures of 40 on the right side. Electrolytes were repleted, and the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 20.5. ID serologies were sent, and the patient's PEEP was reduced overnight. A pulmonary consult was placed, and pathology from the OR is pending. The patient's urine was alkalinized due to concerns for persistently elevated CKs in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. The patient did not have an NG tube placed yet. The goal is to wean the patient off the ventilator today.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on 10/2 at 8:00 PM (cefipime), 9:00 PM (vancomycin), 10:00 PM (doxycycline), and 5:51 AM on 10/3 (clindamycin). The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and famotidine (Pepcid).

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell
   transplant in 05 presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR
   emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac
   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   .
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, s/p epinephrine x1, CPR for 3
   minutes, may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia
   causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had rapid return of perfusing
   rhythm.  There was significant concern for initial poor neurologic
   status post code, however, pt has now had return of neuro function and
   following commands. Suspect that meds given peri code contributed to
   poor neuro status initially, now clearing.
   - replete lytes aggressively, pt is hyponatremic, still unclear
   etiology
   - serially neuro exams
   - would like to elucidate etiology of cardiac arrest better
 most
   likely etiology is hypoxia, with history of upper airway swelling would
   consider allergy/angioedema, would also consider PE as well as
   hypotension, sepsis
   - cooling protocol was deferred secondary to improving neuro exams
   - echo from yesterday did not show any evidence of right heart strain,
   mild LV hypertrophy, LVEF 50-55% with dilated aortic root, ascending
   aorta moderately dilated, small pericardial effusion
   - goal is to maintain MAP > 60 and maintain urine output > 100 cc/hr
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidism. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may
   have pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have
   definite airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given
   immunosuppression.
   - cont hypoxia may be secondary to atelectasis vs. fluid overload
   secondary to volume repletion vs. Pulmonary embolus
   - wean oxygen/PEEP as tolerated however gases have been limiting us
   overnight (mental status is not a barrier to extubation)
   - will bring PEEP to 10 this morning
   - echo today to rule out blown RV which might indicate PE to explain
   etiology of hypoxia
   - continue aggressive suction
   - decreased RR to improve respiratory alkalosis, new ph 7.44
   - empiric Abx Vanc/Cefepime/Clinda/Doxy for any possible pericode &
   emergency trach aspiration
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   - NPO for now, working on SBT with trach collar in AM
   .
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op
   - continue Vanc/Cefepime/clinda for skin flora and ?immunocomp state,
   will cover gram negatives until cultures return, then narrow Abx
   - appreciate ID recs
 ID thinks that this might be a global process,
   reccomending west [**Doctor First Name **] serologies, stool enterovirus, ebv viral load,
   ebv, cmv, hav, hbv, hcv, lyme [**Doctor Last Name 376**] serologies  - HIV testing
   then consider viral load, also MRI
   - if goes to OR would consider muscle biopsy, repeat bacterial cx,
   viral cv
   - f/u cultures, try to get viral cx
   - dressing changes per Vascular
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Pt presented with hyponatremia of unclear etiology, may
   all be secondary to hypothyroidism.  Appears clinically euvolemic to
   hypervolemic currently, no prior h/o SIADH.  Pt having alot of urine
   output currently, it is possible that this hyponatremia & hypochloremia
   is due to volume overload.
   - continue NS IVF
   - serial lytes q6hrs
   - f/u urine lytes & osms
   - continue to treat hypothyroidism
   .
   # Multiple Myelomma: Pt has been on Revlimid which may have been
   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   - f/u Onc recs
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome with intracompartment abcess, now s/p fasciotomy
   - continue aggressive IVF, keep UOP>100cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine & f/u renal recs
   - continue local wound care per vasc
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated transaminases & elevated LDH in setting
   of acute rhabdo. Baseline LFTs normal.  Unclear if this is due to
   atypical infection vs acute rhabdo. Suspect that may continue to worsen
   today as patient is s/p cardiac arrest.
   - trend LFTs
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - f/u ID recs & atypical infection work up
   .
   # Anemia: Hct was 34.7 on admission, now down to 21. s/p 1 unit
   transfusion overnight.This is likely complicated by underlying abnormal
   bone marrow on revlimid for MM and intra-operative blood loss.
   - will transfuse another unit this AM, re-check crit and consider
   furthur
   - transfuse to maintain hct>25
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Pt profoundly hypothyroid with TSH>50 and low T4.
   This may be contributing to tongue swelling on admission.
   -          continue Levothyroxine 200mg IV daily
   -          endocrine does not think hypothyoidism is the etiology of
   patient
s presentation
   -          cortisol level pending

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, who presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels. He underwent an emergent fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and is now in the ICU. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation with epinephrine. He also had an emergency tracheostomy performed. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 129/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient has undergone several procedures, including a transesophageal echocardiogram, central line placement, and a fasciotomy. He is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain medications, and IV fluids. The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated CK levels. The assessment and plan include repletion of electrolytes, serial neuro exams, weaning off the ventilator, addressing the cause of the cardiac arrest, managing respiratory failure, treating compartment syndrome, and investigating potential infections. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring due to his recent cardiac arrest and emergency tracheostomy. He may require further support with ventilation and oxygenation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell
   transplant in 05 presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR
   emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac
   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidism. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may
   have pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have
   definite airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given
   immunosuppression.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size when appropriate
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, s/p epinephrine x1, CPR for 3
   minutes, may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia
   causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had rapid return of perfusing
   rhythm.  There was significant concern for initial poor neurologic
   status post code, however, pt has now had return of neuro function and
   following commands. Suspect that meds given peri code contributed to
   poor neuro status initially, now clearing.
   - persistently low Calcium despite repletion, continue aggressive
   repletion
   - patient is now awake, alert, responsive
   - etiology of arrest likely hypoxia, with upper airway swelling likely
   secondary to myxedema from hypothryoidism
   - echo from yesterday did not show any evidence of right heart strain,
   mild LV hypertrophy, LVEF 50-55% with dilated aortic root, ascending
   aorta moderately dilated, small pericardial effusion
   - goal is to maintain MAP > 60 and maintain urine output > 100 cc/hr
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op
   - now s/p fasciotomy to right leg as well for elevated pressures
   - continue Cefepime/clinda for skin flora and ?immunocomp state, will
   cover gram negatives until cultures return, then narrow Abx
   - d/c Vancomycin at this time as no evidence of gram + infection
   - as per ID do not think that overall etiology is infectious, however
   recommending west [**Doctor First Name **] serology which is pending, stool enterovirus -
   pending, ebv viral load, ebv, cmv, hav, hbv, hcv, lyme [**Doctor Last Name 376**]
   serologies
   - consider hiv testing
   - ordered urine viral culture and well as respiratory viral culture
   - dressing changes per Vascular
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Pt presented with hyponatremia likely  secondary to
   hypothyroidism or from effective volume depletion, secondary to
   multiple surgeries.  Pt currently with good urine output.
   - continue NS IVF
   - urine lytes
 Urea 257 Cr 51 Na 13 K 31
   - serum osms 258
   - continue to treat hypothyroidism, will call endocrine to assess
   whether or not patient needs increase in dose
   .
   # Multiple Myelomma: Pt has been on Revlimid which may have been
   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   - f/u Onc recs
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome with intracompartment abcess, now s/p fasciotomy
   - continue aggressive IVF,  given persistently elevated CKs, will
   alkalinize the urine despite mildly elevated pH, give 200 cc/hr and
   goal to keep UOP>100cc/hr
   - creatine has been stable, will continue to follow-up renal recs
   - continue local wound care per vasc
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated transaminases & elevated LDH in setting
   of acute rhabdo. Baseline LFTs normal.  Unclear if this is due to
   atypical infection vs acute rhabdo. Suspect that may continue to worsen
   today as patient is s/p cardiac arrest.
   - hep A antibody [**Last Name (LF) 400**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] send for IgM levels
   - LFTs remain elevated in the setting of continued CK elevation, which
   may be muscle only
   - remainder of hep serologies pending
   - ID work- up as above
   .
   # Anemia: Hct was 34.7 on admission, which has trended down .This is
   likely complicated by underlying abnormal bone marrow on revlimid for
   MM and intra-operative blood loss.
   - will continue to transfuse and try to maintainhct>25
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Pt profoundly hypothyroid with TSH>50 and low T4.
   This may be contributing to tongue swelling on admission.
   -          continue Levothyroxine 200mg IV daily
   -          think that profound hypothyroidism in the context of statin
   use may have caused presentation
   -          will check daily TSH, free T4, free T3
   -          cortisol level WNL
   .
   # FEN:
   - speech/swallow eval cleared patient for thin liquids and soft
   dysphagic diet, however patient is requesting pureed diet as right now
   he doesn
t have his dentures
   - can advance diet to dysphagic once patient has dentures
   - NS fluid 150 cc/hr to maintain UOP > 100 cc/hr
   - aggressive repletion of lytes
   .
   # Access: Right femoral line placed during code under non-sterile
   conditions, 22 and 20 IV
   -          PICC line today, plan to d/c fem line pending picc line

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, who presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels. He underwent an emergent fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated and an emergency tracheostomy was performed. He is now in the ICU and has been weaned off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required significant support from the ventilator to maintain oxygenation, suggesting a component of negative inspiratory pressure pulmonary edema. This could be due to upper airway swelling and blood in the airways.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but it may have been caused by acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia leading to bradycardia. The patient had a rapid return of perfusing rhythm after receiving epinephrine.

3. Compartment Syndrome with Abscess: The patient had compartment syndrome with pus found in the compartments after opening them. Deep cultures were sent intraoperatively. He also had elevated compartment pressures on the right side, necessitating a fasciotomy.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient presented with hyponatremia likely secondary to hypothyroidism or effective volume depletion due to multiple surgeries. His urine output is currently good.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma (MM) who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant in [**2162**]. He presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels and was found to have bilateral compartment syndrome with tracheal swelling likely secondary to profound hypothyroidism and concurrent statin use.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 88 bpm with a range of 67-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/56 mmHg to 135/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute with a range of 17-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheal mask. The patient's weight is currently 118.3 kg, and his height is 72 inches.

The patient received various antibiotics including cefipime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, and doxycycline. He also received medications such as famotidine (Pepcid) and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for neurologic symptoms, including agitation and writing that he was kidnapped, refusing to cooperate with the exam.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell
   transplant in 05 presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR
   emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac
   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidism. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may
   have pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have
   definite airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given
   immunosuppression.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size which cannot occur until
   7-14 days after initial trach placement
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, s/p epinephrine x1, CPR for 3
   minutes, may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia
   causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had rapid return of perfusing
   rhythm.  There was significant concern for initial poor neurologic
   status post code, however, pt has now had return of neuro function and
   following commands. Suspect that meds given peri code contributed to
   poor neuro status initially, now clearing.
   - persistently low Calcium despite repletion, continue aggressive
   repletion
   - patient is now awake, alert, responsive
   - etiology of arrest likely hypoxia, with upper airway swelling likely
   secondary to myxedema from hypothryoidism
   - echo did not show any evidence of right heart strain, mild LV
   hypertrophy, LVEF 50-55% with dilated aortic root, ascending aorta
   moderately dilated, small pericardial effusion
   - goal is to maintain MAP > 60 and maintain urine output > 100 cc/hr
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op
   - now s/p fasciotomy to right leg as well for elevated pressures
   - continue Cefepime for skin flora and ?immunocomp state, will cover
   gram negatives until cultures return, then narrow Abx
   - culture data all no growth to date, peeled off vancomycin yesterday,
   will d/c clindamycin todaoy

   # Hyponatremia: Pt presented with hyponatremia likely  secondary to
   hypothyroidism or from effective volume depletion, in the setting of
   compartment syndomre.

   # Multiple Myelomma: Pt has been on Revlimid which may have been
   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression from treatment.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   - f/u Onc recs
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome with intracompartment abcess, now s/p fasciotomy
   - continue aggressive IVF,  given persistently elevated CKs, previously
   alkalinization of the urine leading to elevated pH, now switched back
   to NS at 100 cc/hr
   - creatine has been stable, no evidence of acute renal failuer,
   follow-up renal recs
   - continue local wound care per vasc
   .
   Infectious work-up: Concern for infection as initial etiology of
   rhabdomylosis, completing full work-up as per ID.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant in 2005. He presented with foot pain and elevated CKs, leading to the diagnosis of bilateral compartment syndrome with tracheal swelling, likely secondary to profound hypothyroidism and concurrent statin use. The patient's mental status has significantly decreased, and he is now unable to recognize where he is, refusing physical examination. His vital signs are stable, but he requires invasive ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, cardiac arrest with emergency tracheotomy, compartment syndrome with abscess, hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated CK levels, and hypothyroidism. Infectious work-up has been completed, with negative results for various organisms. The patient's LFT abnormalities are attributed to acute rhabdomyolysis or viral hepatitis. Anemia is likely due to bone marrow suppression from treatment for multiple myeloma and intraoperative blood loss. Hypothyroidism may be contributing to tongue swelling on admission. The patient's current medications include levothyroxine IV, famotidine, bicarbonate in D5W fluids, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required significant support from a ventilator to maintain oxygenation but is now being weaned off. There was likely a component of negative inspiratory pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell
   transplant in 05 presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR
   emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac
   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidism. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may
   have pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have
   definite airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given
   immunosuppression.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size when appropriate
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, s/p epinephrine x1, CPR for 3
   minutes, may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia
   causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had rapid return of perfusing
   rhythm.  There was significant concern for initial poor neurologic
   status post code, however, pt has now had return of neuro function and
   following commands. Suspect that meds given peri code contributed to
   poor neuro status initially, now clearing.
   - persistently low Calcium despite repletion, continue aggressive
   repletion
   - patient is now awake, alert, responsive
   - etiology of arrest likely hypoxia, with upper airway swelling likely
   secondary to myxedema from hypothryoidism
   - echo from yesterday did not show any evidence of right heart strain,
   mild LV hypertrophy, LVEF 50-55% with dilated aortic root, ascending
   aorta moderately dilated, small pericardial effusion
   - goal is to maintain MAP > 60 and maintain urine output > 100 cc/hr
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op
   - now s/p fasciotomy to right leg as well for elevated pressures
   - continue Cefepime/clinda for skin flora and ?immunocomp state, will
   cover gram negatives until cultures return, then narrow Abx
   - d/c Vancomycin at this time as no evidence of gram + infection
   - as per ID do not think that overall etiology is infectious, however
   recommending west [**Doctor First Name **] serology which is pending, stool enterovirus -
   pending, ebv viral load, ebv, cmv, hav, hbv, hcv, lyme [**Doctor Last Name 376**]
   serologies
   - consider hiv testing
   - ordered urine viral culture and well as respiratory viral culture
   - dressing changes per Vascular
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Pt presented with hyponatremia likely  secondary to
   hypothyroidism or from effective volume depletion, secondary to
   multiple surgeries.  Pt currently with good urine output.
   - continue NS IVF
   - urine lytes
 Urea 257 Cr 51 Na 13 K 31
   - serum osms 258
   - continue to treat hypothyroidism, will call endocrine to assess
   whether or not patient needs increase in dose
   .
   # Multiple Myelomma: Pt has been on Revlimid which may have been
   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   - f/u Onc recs
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome with intracompartment abcess, now s/p fasciotomy
   - continue aggressive IVF,  given persistently elevated CKs, will
   alkalinize the urine despite mildly elevated pH, give 200 cc/hr and
   goal to keep UOP>100cc/hr
   - creatine has been stable, will continue to follow-up renal recs
   - continue local wound care per vasc
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated transaminases & elevated LDH in setting
   of acute rhabdo. Baseline LFTs normal.  Unclear if this is due to
   atypical infection vs acute rhabdo. Suspect that may continue to worsen
   today as patient is s/p cardiac arrest.
   - hep A antibody [**Last Name (LF) 400**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] send for IgM levels
   - LFTs remain elevated in the setting of continued CK elevation, which
   may be muscle only
   - remainder of hep serologies pending
   - ID work- up as above
   .
   # Anemia: Hct was 34.7 on admission, which has trended down .This is
   likely complicated by underlying abnormal bone marrow on revlimid for
   MM and intra-operative blood loss.
   - will continue to transfuse and try to maintainhct>25
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Pt profoundly hypothyroid with TSH>50 and low T4.
   This may be contributing to tongue swelling on admission.
   -          continue Levothyroxine 200mg IV daily
   -          think that profound hypothyroidism in the context of statin
   use may have caused presentation
   -          will check daily TSH, free T4, free T3
   -          cortisol level WNL
   .
   # FEN:
   - speech/swallow eval cleared patient for thin liquids and soft
   dysphagic diet, however patient is requesting pureed diet as right now
   he doesn
t have his dentures
   - can advance diet to dysphagic once patient has dentures
   - NS fluid 150 cc/hr to maintain UOP > 100 cc/hr
   - aggressive repletion of lytes
   .
   # Access: Right femoral line placed during code under non-sterile
   conditions, 22 and 20 IV
   -          PICC line today, plan to d/c fem line pending picc line
   placement and stable blood pressure

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant in 2016. He presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels and was diagnosed with bilateral compartment syndrome with tracheal swelling, likely secondary to profound hypothyroidism and concurrent statin use. The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and he is now disoriented and agitated, refusing to cooperate with the exam. He also experienced a cardiac arrest and required an emergency tracheotomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required significant support from a ventilator to maintain oxygenation due to upper airway edema. Although he is now weaning off the ventilator, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if airway obstruction recurs.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but it may have been caused by acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia leading to bradycardia. The patient received epinephrine during the code and had a rapid return of perfusing rhythm.

3. Compartment Syndrome with Abscess: The patient had definitive surgical intervention with fasciotomy, and pus was found in the compartments. Deep cultures were sent intraoperatively. The patient also developed compartment syndrome in the right leg and underwent a fasciotomy.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient presented with hyponatremia, likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell
   transplant in 05 presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR
   emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac
   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidism. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may
   have pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have
   definite airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given
   immunosuppression.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size when appropriate
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, s/p epinephrine x1, CPR for 3
   minutes, may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia
   causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had rapid return of perfusing
   rhythm.  There was significant concern for initial poor neurologic
   status post code, however, pt has now had return of neuro function and
   following commands. Suspect that meds given peri code contributed to
   poor neuro status initially, now clearing.
   - persistently low Calcium despite repletion, continue aggressive
   repletion
   - patient is now awake, alert, responsive
   - etiology of arrest likely hypoxia, with upper airway swelling likely
   secondary to myxedema from hypothryoidism
   - echo from yesterday did not show any evidence of right heart strain,
   mild LV hypertrophy, LVEF 50-55% with dilated aortic root, ascending
   aorta moderately dilated, small pericardial effusion
   - goal is to maintain MAP > 60 and maintain urine output > 100 cc/hr
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op
   - now s/p fasciotomy to right leg as well for elevated pressures
   - continue Cefepime/clinda for skin flora and ?immunocomp state, will
   cover gram negatives until cultures return, then narrow Abx
   - d/c Vancomycin at this time as no evidence of gram + infection
   - as per ID do not think that overall etiology is infectious, however
   recommending west [**Doctor First Name **] serology which is pending, stool enterovirus -
   pending, ebv viral load, ebv, cmv, hav, hbv, hcv, lyme [**Doctor Last Name 376**]
   serologies
   - consider hiv testing
   - ordered urine viral culture and well as respiratory viral culture
   - dressing changes per Vascular
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Pt presented with hyponatremia likely  secondary to
   hypothyroidism or from effective volume depletion, secondary to
   multiple surgeries.  Pt currently with good urine output.
   - continue NS IVF
   - urine lytes
 Urea 257 Cr 51 Na 13 K 31
   - serum osms 258
   - continue to treat hypothyroidism, will call endocrine to assess
   whether or not patient needs increase in dose
   .
   # Multiple Myelomma: Pt has been on Revlimid which may have been
   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   - f/u Onc recs
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome with intracompartment abcess, now s/p fasciotomy
   - continue aggressive IVF,  given persistently elevated CKs, will
   alkalinize the urine despite mildly elevated pH, give 200 cc/hr and
   goal to keep UOP>100cc/hr
   - creatine has been stable, will continue to follow-up renal recs
   - continue local wound care per vasc

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma who presented with foot pain, elevated CK levels, and bilateral compartment syndrome with tracheal swelling likely secondary to profound hypothyroidism and concurrent statin use. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and required emergency tracheotomy. He is now in the ICU, requiring invasive ventilation, and has been weaned off the ventilator. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, compartment syndrome with abscess, hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated CK levels, rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver function tests, hypothyroidism, and anemia of chronic disease. Infectious work-ups have been negative so far, and the patient is awaiting results for additional tests including West Nile virus, CMV, hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, as well as various viral cultures. The patient's condition is stable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, infection, kidney injury, liver injury, and complications related to his underlying multiple myeloma."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has a history of rhabdomyolysis, hypothyroidism, and an infection that requires antibiotic treatment. The patient is on invasive ventilation and has been receiving various medications, including statins, which may have contributed to the rhabdomyolysis. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a slightly elevated temperature. The patient's lab results show abnormalities in several areas, including elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and low albumin levels. There are also indications of electrolyte imbalances and kidney dysfunction.

Potential medical complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated levels of CK suggest ongoing muscle damage, which can lead to kidney injury and other complications if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypothyroidism: The patient's low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level indicates possible hypothyroidism, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Infection: The patient's infection status is mentioned but not fully detailed. It is important to monitor and manage the infection appropriately to prevent complications such as sepsis.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated levels of creatinine and BUN, along with the decreased urine output, suggest possible kidney dysfunction. This requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell
   transplant in 05 presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR
   emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac
   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidism. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may
   have pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have
   definite airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given
   immunosuppression.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size which cannot occur until
   7-14 days after initial trach placement
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, s/p epinephrine x1, CPR for 3
   minutes, may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia
   causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had rapid return of perfusing
   rhythm.  There was significant concern for initial poor neurologic
   status post code, however, pt has now had return of neuro function and
   following commands. Suspect that meds given peri code contributed to
   poor neuro status initially, now clearing.
   - persistently low Calcium despite repletion, continue aggressive
   repletion
   - patient is now awake, alert, responsive
   - etiology of arrest likely hypoxia, with upper airway swelling likely
   secondary to myxedema from hypothryoidism
   - echo did not show any evidence of right heart strain, mild LV
   hypertrophy, LVEF 50-55% with dilated aortic root, ascending aorta
   moderately dilated, small pericardial effusion
   - goal is to maintain MAP > 60 and maintain urine output > 100 cc/hr
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op
   - now s/p fasciotomy to right leg as well for elevated pressures
   - continue Cefepime for skin flora and ?immunocomp state, will cover
   gram negatives until cultures return, then narrow Abx
   - culture data all no growth to date, peeled off vancomycin yesterday,
   will d/c clindamycin todaoy

   # Hyponatremia: Pt presented with hyponatremia likely  secondary to
   hypothyroidism or from effective volume depletion, in the setting of
   compartment syndomre.
   -hyponatremia improved today
   - continue NS IVF at 100cc/hr
   - urine lytes

   - serum osms 258
   - continue to treat hypothyroidism, as per endocrine will continue

   .
   # Multiple Myelomma: Pt has been on Revlimid which may have been
   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression from treatment.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   - f/u Onc recs
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome with intracompartment abcess, now s/p fasciotomy
   - continue aggressive IVF,  given persistently elevated CKs, previously
   alkalinization of the urine leading to elevated pH, now switched back
   to NS at 100 cc/hr
   - creatine has been stable, no evidence of acute renal failuer,
   follow-up renal recs
   - continue local wound care per vasc
   .
   Infectious work-up: Concern for infection as initial etiology of
   rhabdomylosis, completing full work-up as per ID.

   patient is s/p cardiac arrest.
   - hep A antibody [**Last Name (LF) 400**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] send for IgM levels

   # Anemia: Hct was 34.7 on admission, which has trended down .This is
   likely complicated by underlying abnormal bone marrow on revlimid for
   MM and intra-operative blood loss.
   - will continue to transfuse and try to maintainhct>25
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Pt profoundly hypothyroid with TSH>50 and low T4.
   This may be contributing to tongue swelling on admission.
   -    continue Levothyroxine 200mg IV daily
   -  think that profound hypothyroidism in the context of statin use may
   have caused presentation

He underwent an emergent fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and was later transferred to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest. The patient required an emergency tracheotomy and is now awake, alert, and responsive.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required significant support from the ventilator to maintain oxygenation, but is now being weaned off. There was likely a component of negative inspiratory pressure pulmonary edema as seen by perihilar fullness on chest X-ray. This is also suggested by the fact that the patient is weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirements. Some increased secretions from the emergency tracheotomy and blood in the airways may have contributed to the respiratory failure.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear. The patient received epinephrine and CPR for three minutes, and there was a rapid return of perfusing rhythm. The initial poor neurological status post-code is now clearing. The arrest likely resulted from hypoxia, with upper airway swelling likely secondary to myxedema from hypothyroidism.

3. Compartment Syndrome with Abscess: The patient had definitive surgical intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening the compartments. Deep cultures were sent intraoperatively. The patient also"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell
   transplant in 05 presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR
   emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac
   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidism. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may
   have pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have
   definite airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given
   immunosuppression.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size which cannot occur until
   7-14 days after initial trach placement
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, s/p epinephrine x1, CPR for 3
   minutes, may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia
   causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had rapid return of perfusing
   rhythm.  There was significant concern for initial poor neurologic
   status post code, however, pt has now had return of neuro function and
   following commands. Suspect that meds given peri code contributed to
   poor neuro status initially, now clearing.
   - persistently low Calcium despite repletion, continue aggressive
   repletion
   - patient is now awake, alert, responsive
   - etiology of arrest likely hypoxia, with upper airway swelling likely
   secondary to myxedema from hypothryoidism
   - echo did not show any evidence of right heart strain, mild LV
   hypertrophy, LVEF 50-55% with dilated aortic root, ascending aorta
   moderately dilated, small pericardial effusion
   - goal is to maintain MAP > 60 and maintain urine output > 100 cc/hr
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, who presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels. He underwent an emergent fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and was subsequently diagnosed with profound hypothyroidism. The patient experienced cardiac arrest and required an emergency tracheotomy. He also has an infection in his leg wound, which was found to have pus during the surgery. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including cefepime, clindamycin, and vancomycin. He has shown improvement in his respiratory status and is now only on supplemental oxygen. However, he continues to have elevated CK levels and evidence of rhabdomyolysis. The patient's liver function tests are also abnormal, with elevated transaminases and LDH. He has a history of hepatitis B and is now testing positive for hepatitis A antibodies. The patient's hemoglobin level is low, likely due to bone marrow suppression from his multiple myeloma treatment and intraoperative blood loss. He is currently receiving blood transfusions. The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, particularly with hyponatremia. His thyroid hormone levels are severely low, and he is being treated with levothyroxine. The patient's condition is stable at this time, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU. Potential medical complications include ongoing respiratory failure, infection, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell
   transplant in 05 presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR
   emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac
   arrest and emergency tracheotomy.
   # Resp failure: Pt was transferred to ICU s/p cardiac arrest with
   emergency trach and was initially requiring alot of support from vent
   to maintain oxygenation but now weaning quickly.  There was likely a
   component of negative inspiratory pressure pulm edema as seen by
   perihilar fullness on CXR.  This is also suggested by the fact that pt
   weaning quickly from initially high O2 requirement. Also with some
   increased secretions from emergency trach and blood in airways.
   Etiology of tongue swelling early on [**10-1**] and impressive upper airway
   edema seen by Anesthesia impeding the ability to re-intubate is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 11**] have some component of airway collapse and tongue swelling
   from hypothyroidism. Baseline, pt is a Mallampati class III and may
   have pharyngeal airway collapse complicating picture.  Now have
   definite airway with trach, will hold off on steroids for now given
   immunosuppression.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size which cannot occur until
   7-14 days after initial trach placement
   - Alb/atrovent nebs
   # s/p Cardiac Arrest: Etiology unclear, s/p epinephrine x1, CPR for 3
   minutes, may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia
   causing cardiac arrest/bradycardia. Pt had rapid return of perfusing
   rhythm.  There was significant concern for initial poor neurologic
   status post code, however, pt has now had return of neuro function and
   following commands. Suspect that meds given peri code contributed to
   poor neuro status initially, now clearing.
   - persistently low Calcium despite repletion, continue aggressive
   repletion
   - patient is now awake, alert, responsive
   - etiology of arrest likely hypoxia, with upper airway swelling likely
   secondary to myxedema from hypothryoidism
   - echo did not show any evidence of right heart strain, mild LV
   hypertrophy, LVEF 50-55% with dilated aortic root, ascending aorta
   moderately dilated, small pericardial effusion
   - goal is to maintain MAP > 60 and maintain urine output > 100 cc/hr
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op
   - now s/p fasciotomy to right leg as well for elevated pressures
   - continue Cefepime for skin flora and ?immunocomp state, will cover

   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression from treatment.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   - f/u Onc recs
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome with intracompartment abcess, now s/p fasciotomy
   - continue aggressive IVF,  given persistently elevated CKs, previously
   alkalinization of the urine leading to elevated pH, now switched back
   to NS at 100 cc/hr
   - creatine has been stable, no evidence of acute renal failuer,
   follow-up renal recs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma who presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels. He underwent an emergency fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and was later transferred to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and emergency tracheotomy.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient initially required significant support from a ventilator to maintain oxygenation, but is now weaning quickly. There was likely a component of negative inspiratory pressure pulmonary edema, suggested by the presence of perihilar fullness on chest X-ray.
- Cardiac arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but it may have been due to acute upper airway swelling and hypoxia causing bradycardia. The patient had a rapid return of perfusing rhythm after receiving epinephrine during CPR.
- Compartment syndrome with abscess: The patient underwent a definitive surgical intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening the compartments. Deep cultures were sent intra-operatively, and the patient has now had a second fasciotomy for elevated pressures in the right leg. Antibiotic coverage will be narrowed once culture results are available.
- Hyponatremia: The patient presented with hyponatremia likely secondary to hypothyroidism or from effective volume depletion in the setting of compartment syndrome. Sodium levels have improved today, and the patient is being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, who presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels. He underwent an emergent fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and is now post-cardiac arrest and emergency tracheotomy. 

The patient successfully extubated with tracheostomy and is off steroids for now given immunosuppression. There is no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE. He was weaned off the ventilator and is now using a tracheostomy, with good mental status and respiratory drive. Aggressive suctioning is required. The patient will need tracheostomy cuff change to a smaller size, which cannot occur until 7-14 days after initial tracheostomy placement.

His elevated CK levels were likely secondary to compartment syndrome with intracompartmental abscess, but other etiologies cannot be fully ruled out yet. Fluids have been stopped, and monitoring of I/O is ongoing with a goal of negative 1L.

The patient has had definitive surgical intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening compartments. Deep cultures were sent intra-operatively. He also had fasciotomy to the right leg for elevated pressures. Cefepime is being continued for skin flora and probable immunocompromised state, covering gram negatives until cultures return, then narrowing antibiotic therapy. Cultures to date have shown no growth, and vancomycin was"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and pulseless arrest following an emergency tracheotomy. The patient's 24-hour events include being restrained overnight due to combative behavior, which is likely ""sundowning"" as the patient becomes more oriented. The patient's abdomen was tense with a dilated small bowel, possibly indicative of colon distention. The patient had a large bowel movement and the abdomen was soft afterwards. The healthcare team attempted to start antibiotics (Zosyn/Vanco) for open wounds but were denied by the ID department. Instead, wound vac will likely be initiated tomorrow. The patient received lovenox for prophylactic treatment of PE. Discussion about downsizing the tracheostomy tube is planned for early next week. The patient's CK level decreased to 9800s and received a 10mg IV lasix dose for diuresis. The patient became agitated at night and broke the foley catheter in half; it was replaced. Haldol qhs was prescribed for agitation. The arterial line was not accurately placed and was discontinued by nursing. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient received various antibiotics on different dates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell transplant in 05
   presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR emergently for
   fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac arrest and
   emergency tracheotomy and then subsequent fasciotomy on the other side.
   # Resp failure: Patient with tracheostomy right now, off of
   ventilator.  Initial respiratory failure likely secondary to laryngeal
   edema.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE as etiology
   of respiratory failure
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will try to cap the trach today and see how he does
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size 7-14 days after initial
   trach placement
   - Alb/atrovent nebs standing
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome, now s/p bilateral fasciotomy. Unclear if this is due only to
   profound hypothyoidism or other etiology
   - initially treated with aggressive IV fluids with alkinilization 150
   meq NaHCO3 in D5W, then switched to NS, now off all fluids with CK now
   4500 (from peak 21, 000)
   - renal function OK
   -Monitof I/O; goal -500 to -1L now, patient responds to lasix
   #) Abdomen
   - patient abdomen distended, tympanic
   - abdominal x-ray on Friday demonstrated 8.6 cm dilated loops
   - patient is stooling quite a bit in the setting of previous
   constipation
   - concern for c. diff, has been sent, but not yet back
   - if WBC elevated, or spikes, or stooling production worsens then would
   start empirically on c. diff treatment
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op and all cultures have
   been negative. Patient then underwent second fasciotomy for elevated
   compartment pressure in other leg. Patient initially treated with
   Cefepime, clinda, vanco to cover skin flora and also in the setting of
   immunocompromised state.  Infectious disease was following. In the
   setting of negative cultures, antibiotics were peeled off, and now
   patient completely off of antibiotics.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant in 2016. He presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels, leading to an emergency fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome. The patient then experienced cardiac arrest, likely secondary to hypoxia, and subsequently underwent an emergent tracheotomy and fasciotomy on the other side.

Currently, the patient is awake and alert, with a tracheostomy in place and receiving supplemental oxygen. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/62 mmHg to 170/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but is expected to be weaned off soon.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 0.9 mg/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) at 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.6 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) at 77 K/uL, and lactate levels at 0.9 mmol/L. Blood cultures were negative for any growth. The patient has tested positive for hepatitis A, B core antibody, and surface antibody, with an undetected viral load for hepatitis B.

   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op and all cultures have
   been negative. Patient then underwent second fasciotomy for elevated
   compartment pressure in other leg. Patient initially treated with
   Cefepime, clinda, vanco to cover skin flora and also in the setting of
   immunocompromised state.  Infectious disease was following. In the
   setting of negative cultures, antibiotics were peeled off, and now
   patient completely off of antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant in 2016. He presented with foot pain and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, leading to an emergency fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome. The patient subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest and required an emergency tracheotomy and another fasciotomy on the other side. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure likely secondary to laryngeal edema. Although he has been weaned off the ventilator and is now using a tracheostomy, ongoing suctioning and tracheostomy cuff changes will be necessary.
2. Elevated CK/Rhabdomyolysis: The elevated CK levels were likely due to compartment syndrome, which has now been addressed with bilateral fasciotomies. It is unclear if this is solely due to profound hypothyroidism or another etiology.
3. Compartment Syndrome with Abscess: The patient had definitive surgical intervention for compartment syndrome with abscess formation. Deep cultures were sent intra-operatively, and all cultures have been negative. Antibiotics were initially started but have since been stopped due to negative cultures.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level was 25.8 on admission, indicating anemia. This is likely complicated by underlying abnormal bone marrow due to treatment for multiple my"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a past medical history of multiple myeloma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant in 2162. He presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels, leading to an emergent fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome. Subsequently, he experienced cardiac arrest likely secondary to hypoxia and underwent an emergent tracheotomy. The patient's CK levels continued to trend down, and fluids were stopped yesterday. He had some delirium overnight but showed improvement in mental status. The patient received 10 mg IV lasix yesterday to meet diuresis goals.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Compartment syndrome: The patient initially presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels, which necessitated an emergent fasciotomy. Compartment syndrome is a serious condition where increased pressure within a muscle compartment compromises circulation and function of the tissues within that space. If left untreated, it can lead to muscle and nerve damage, loss of limb, or even life-threatening conditions.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest likely secondary to hypoxia. Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening emergency where the heart suddenly stops beating. Immediate medical intervention is crucial to restore blood circulation and prevent permanent damage or death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient underwent an emergent tracheotomy due to respiratory failure. Respiratory failure occurs when the lungs fail to provide enough oxygen to the body or remove carbon dioxide efficiently. It can be caused by various factors, including severe lung disease, trauma, or airway obstruction.
4. Delirium: The patient had some delirium overnight but showed improvement in mental status. Delirium is an acute change in mental status characterized by confusion, disorientation, and fluctuating levels of consciousness. It can be caused by various factors such as infection, medication side effects, metabolic imbalances, or organ dysfunction.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU. DVT is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, usually in the legs. If the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs, it can cause a potentially fatal condition known as pulmonary embolism.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessment and management of the patient."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall, 118.3 kg overweight/obese individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. They have been intubated and are on a tracheostomy. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C, blood pressure ranging from 103/56 to 155/108 mmHg, heart rate between 69-99 bpm, respiratory rate of 17-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on SpO2. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total intake of 1,852 mL (including 481 mL IVF) and a total output of 2,070 mL (including 1,950 mL urine output). The patient's weight has increased from 115 kg at admission to 118.3 kg currently.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome, multiple myeloma, anemia, hypothyroidism, and FEN (likely referring to familial essential myopathy). The patient is also being treated for diarrhea and is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's lab results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, glucose levels, liver enzymes, kidney function tests, electrolyte levels, and cardiac markers."

   Addendum: Shortly after rounds, patient had an episode of
   unresponsiveness.  On exam, had some eye deviation but no tonic-clonic
   movements.  He was somewhat flaccid bilaterally on initial exam
   although when arm lifted above his head, he moved it to the side as it
   fell.  Trach was in place so airway was not an issue and arterial blood
   gas was normal.  HCT, MRI, and EEG all performed and were negative and
   patient has now improved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is unchanged from admission, and no new problems have arisen overnight. The patient's CPK continues to fall, indicating improvement in rhabdomyolysis.

The patient has been stable off the ventilator for several days and is ready for transfer to the floor. They have undergone surgery to address compartment syndrome and are showing signs of improvement.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously on ventilator support, which indicates a risk of respiratory failure. However, the patient is now stable off the ventilator, suggesting that this complication has been managed effectively.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient initially presented with rhabdomyolysis, but their CPK levels are falling, indicating improvement. However, there is still a risk of further complications related to muscle damage.

3. Compartment syndrome: The patient underwent surgery to address compartment syndrome. Although the patient is showing signs of improvement, there is still a risk of recurring or worsening compartment syndrome.

4. Multiple myeloma: The patient has a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, which is a chronic condition requiring ongoing management. There is a risk of disease progression or complications related to the underlying condition.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require further investigation and treatment. This could potentially lead to complications if not managed appropriately.

   chain deposit in muscle fibers => rhabdo
   - would like to ask pathology to stain for possible amyloid tomorrow
   - rec levo cont and [** 458**] steroids
   - ID follow-up, to sign off now, think that rhabdomylosis likely
   secondary to systemic etiology (infectious very unlikely unless viral),
   also with abdominal distension, do not think c. diff is cause, suspect
   SBO
   - ordered repeat abdominal x-ray for tomorrow AM, previous abdominal
   x-ray with dilated loops to 8.6 cm, passing stool
   - ordered repeat blood cultures as well as repeat lytes and urgent
   belly x-ray
   - ordered stat abdominal x-ray, chest x-ray, blood cultures, will start
   antiobtiocs
   - tried to place NG tube for CT abdomen, first tube went into stomach
   and then back into esophagus so removed it
   - during second tube attemp, patient with nose bleed that led to some

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell transplant in 05
   presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR emergently for
   fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac arrest and
   emergency tracheotomy and then subsequent fasciotomy on the other side.
   Most recently with episode of unresponsiveness today lasting 2 hours.
   #Episode of non-responsiveness
   -         unclear etiology, at the time ABG okay, FS 90s,
   -         head CT, MRI, EEG negative
   -         seen by neuro resident not yet staffed by neuro attending,
   BMT attending wanted patient to get LP emergently, will plan for LP
   today
   -         differential diagnosis also includes sepsis type syndrome,
   although would be unusual for sepsis type picture to present with
   alteration of consciousness that resolved spontaneously on its own
   -         would also consider possible CNS infection, although again
   complete unresponsiveness is
   # Resp failure: Patient with tracheostomy right now, off of
   ventilator.  Initial respiratory failure likely secondary to laryngeal
   edema.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE as etiology
   of respiratory failure
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will try to cap the trach today and see how he does
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size 7-14 days after initial
   trach placement
   - Alb/atrovent nebs standing
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome, now s/p bilateral fasciotomy. Unclear if this is due only to
   profound hypothyoidism or other etiology
   - initially treated with aggressive IV fluids with alkinilization 150
   meq NaHCO3 in D5W, then switched to NS, now off all fluids with CK now
   4500 (from peak 21, 000)
   - renal function OK
   -Monitof I/O; goal -500 to -1L now, patient responds to lasix
   #) Abdomen
   - patient abdomen distended, tympanic
   - abdominal x-ray on Friday demonstrated 8.6 cm dilated loops
   - patient is stooling quite a bit in the setting of previous
   constipation
   - concern for c. diff, has been sent, but not yet back
   - if WBC elevated, or spikes, or stooling production worsens then would
   start empirically on c. diff treatment
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op and all cultures have
   been negative. Patient then underwent second fasciotomy for elevated
   compartment pressure in other leg. Patient initially treated with
   Cefepime, clinda, vanco to cover skin flora and also in the setting of
   immunocompromised state.  Infectious disease was following. In the
   setting of negative cultures, antibiotics were peeled off, and now
   patient completely off of antibiotics.

   # Multiple Myelomma: Pt has been on Revlimid which may have been
   contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.  Anemia & thrombocytopenia
   on admission likely due to marrow suppression from treatment.
   - holding Revlimid currently
   .
   # Anemia: Hct was 25.8 on admission, now h/h [**10-23**] .This is likely
   complicated by underlying abnormal bone marrow on revlimid for MM and
   intra-operative blood loss.
   - will continue to transfuse and try to maintainhct>25, today crit is
   borderline, will hold off on additional transfusion for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Pt TSH is improving; now 22 from 50.
   -    continue Levothyroxine 200mg IV daily
   -  think that profound hypothyroidism in the context of statin use may
   have caused initial presentation
   -   hold off on repeating TSH, free T3, free T4 for 1 week, cortisol

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who presented with foot pain and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. He underwent an emergent fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest and had an emergency tracheotomy. The patient was then taken to the operating room for another fasciotomy on the other side. His recent episode of unresponsiveness lasted for 2 hours, and all imaging and EEG results came back negative. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, elevated CK levels, abdominal distension, and compartment syndrome with abscess. He has undergone multiple interventions and is currently on various medications. The patient's condition is complex and requires ongoing monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is currently off the ventilator, but there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the tracheostomy becomes obstructed or if the patient develops a new lung infection.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK levels indicate rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney damage if not managed appropriately.
3. Abdominal distension: The patient has an abdominal x-ray showing dilated loops of bowel, suggesting possible bowel obstruction. If left untreated, this could progress to bowel ischemia and necrosis.
4. Compartment syndrome: The patient has had two fasciotomies performed due"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell transplant in 05
   presented foot pain and elevated CKs taken the OR emergently for
   fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac arrest and
   emergency tracheotomy and then subsequent fasciotomy on the other side.
   Most recently with episode of unresponsiveness today lasting 2 hours.
   #Episode of non-responsiveness
   -         unclear etiology, at the time ABG okay, FS 90s, vital signs
   stable
   -         head CT, MRI, EEG negative
   -         seen by neuro resident not yet staffed by neuro attending,
   BMT attending wanted patient to get LP emergently, will plan for LP
   first thing this AM
   -         differential diagnosis also includes sepsis type syndrome,
   although would be unusual for sepsis type picture to present with
   alteration of consciousness that resolved spontaneously on its own
   -         would also consider possible CNS infection, although again
   complete unresponsiveness is
   -         with concern for distended abdomen in the context of dilated
   loops of bowel started patient empirically on coverage for possible c.
   diff infection
 on po vanco, iv flagyl
   -         also started on cefepime for possible gram negative coverage
   #Abdominal distension
   - repeat imaging from last night with distended abdomen, loops dilated
   to almost 9 cm
   - sent stool for c diff, negative x1 from [**10-7**]
   - attempted NG tube x2. first tube was coiled in stomach and then went
   back through the esophagus, second NG tube placement complicated by
   nasal bleeding (bleeding was brisk, got some bleeding back through
   trach site), bleed was brisk but stopped quickly
   - decided instead to get fluoro guided NG tube placement for safety
   concern
   - spoke with vascular surgeons who already saw patient this morning,
   agree with need for CT to evaluate abdominal process, think okay to
   wait for fluoro guided ng tube placement this morning given difficulty
   placing NG tube last night
 said that patient is not nauseous, no
   vomiting, burping and passing stool
   - would need separate surgery consult pending results of CT
   - sent repeat c. diff toxin today (only one accepted per day)
   - consider reconsult ID again now that back on broad spectrum
   antibiotics
   # Resp failure: Patient with tracheostomy right now, off of
   ventilator.  Initial respiratory failure likely secondary to laryngeal
   edema.
   - no evidence of right heart strain on echo to suggest PE as etiology
   of respiratory failure
   - patient was weaned off ventilator, now just using trach, mental
   status and respiratory drive good
   - continue aggressive suction
   - will need trach cuff change to smaller size 7-14 days after initial
   trach placement
   - Alb/atrovent nebs standing
   .
   # Elevated CK/Rhabdo: This was likely all secondary to compartment
   syndrome, now s/p bilateral fasciotomy. Unclear if this is due only to
   profound hypothyoidism or other etiology
   - initially treated with aggressive IV fluids with alkinilization 150
   meq NaHCO3 in D5W, then switched to NS, now off all fluids with CK now
   4500 (from peak 21, 000)
   - renal function was perserved throughout episode
   -Monitof I/O; goal -500 to -1L now, patient responds to lasix if needed
   # Compartment Syndrome with abscess: Pt has now had definitive surgical
   intervention with fasciotomy and frank pus found after opening
   compartments.  Deep cultures were sent intra-op and all cultures have
   been negative. Patient then underwent second fasciotomy for elevated
   compartment pressure in other leg. Patient initially treated with
   Cefepime, clinda, vanco to cover skin flora and also in the setting of
   immunocompromised state.  Infectious disease was following. In the
   setting of negative cultures, antibiotics were peeled off, and now
   patient completely off of antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma who presented with foot pain and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. He was taken to the operating room for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and then subsequently underwent an emergency tracheotomy. The patient had an episode of unresponsiveness lasting 2 hours, which was not fully explained by the initial tests including an electroencephalogram (EEG), head computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient's abdominal distension was noted, and he was started on empirical coverage for possible Clostridium difficile infection. The patient had difficulty with nasogastric (NG) tube placement, leading to a decision to proceed with fluoroscopy-guided NG tube placement. The patient's respiratory failure was initially secondary to laryngeal edema. He was weaned off the ventilator and now uses a tracheostomy for breathing. The patient had elevated CK levels likely secondary to compartment syndrome, which improved after bilateral fasciotomy. The patient also had an abscess, for which he underwent surgical intervention. Cultures from the wound and abscess were negative. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and multiple myeloma. He is currently being treated with levothyroxine IV and maintaining hemoglobin levels above 25."

   24 Hour Events:
   Updates: Patient with episode of unresponsiveness today. was going to
   be transferred to the floor. called by nursing to come see patient.
   patient was unresponsive. HR in 70s, BP 120s, breathing comfortably.
   Unresponsive to sternal rub. Would not open eyes. did not withdraw to
   pain except on lower extremities. FS glucose 90s. ABG wnl. concern for
   seizure vs. stroke. emergent head ct official read not back. no
   evidnece of acute bleed on our read or neurology. mri also ordered
   emergently. as per neuroradiologist no evidence of acute infarct on
   MRI/MRA. also got EEG which per technologist did not show any evidnece
   of seizure activity. neurology consulted. appreciate their recs.
   - d/c prn haldol at night, also d/c IV steroids as now on taper.
   - Endocrine follow-up - suggest case reports of amyloid myopathy
   presenting with rhabdomyolysis in MM, also case reports of kappa light
   chain deposit in muscle fibers => rhabdo
   - would like to ask pathology to stain for possible amyloid tomorrow
   - rec levo cont and taper steroids
   - ID follow-up, to sign off now, think that rhabdomylosis likely
   secondary to systemic etiology (infectious very unlikely unless viral),
   also with abdominal distension, do not think c. diff is cause, suspect
   SBO
   - ordered repeat abdominal x-ray for tomorrow AM, previous abdominal
   x-ray with dilated loops to 8.6 cm, passing stool
   - ordered repeat blood cultures as well as repeat lytes and urgent
   belly x-ray
   - ordered stat abdominal x-ray, chest x-ray, blood cultures, will start
   antiobtiocs
   - tried to place NG tube for CT abdomen, first tube went into stomach
   and then back into esophagus so removed it
   - during second tube attemp, patient with nose bleed that led to some
   bleeding out of trach site which appeared to be due to ruptured
   superficial vessel which resolved spontaneously

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma (MM) who presented with foot pain and elevated CK levels. He underwent an emergent fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest and an emergency tracheotomy. The patient's recent episode of unresponsiveness lasted for 2 hours, and despite negative results from a head CT, MRI, and EEG, he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and given an emergent lumbar puncture (LP). The patient's abdominal distension and dilated loops of bowel prompted the initiation of empiric coverage for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, but stool samples have been negative. He also underwent two unsuccessful attempts at nasogastric (NG) tube placement, one of which caused a nosebleed. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, has a tracheostomy, and is weaned off the ventilator. His respiratory failure was initially thought to be secondary to laryngeal edema. The patient's elevated CK levels and compartment syndrome were likely caused by profound hypothyroidism, and he underwent bilateral fasciotomies with the drainage of pus. His renal function was preserved during the episode, and he is now off all fluids. The patient's wounds were cultured, revealing no growth. He tested negative for CMV and other viral infections. He has a history of multiple myeloma and was being treated"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of unresponsiveness. The patient's past medical history includes multiple comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, the patient was alert and oriented but experienced an episode of unresponsiveness. Subsequent tests including a head CT scan, MRI, and EEG were negative, and the patient is now alert and oriented again.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/55 mmHg to 140/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool tracheostomy mask, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 260.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tracheostomy in place, clear lung sounds with bilateral chest tubes, normal heart sounds with no murmurs, and no peripheral pulses assessed due to lack of accessibility. Neurological examination shows that the patient is awake, alert, and oriented with no focal neuro findings.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.8 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 74 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 117 mg/dL, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.3 mEq/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 104 mEq/L, and elevated creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, elevated cardiac markers, and abnormal coagulation profile.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues: transient unresponsiveness, abdominal distension, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, anemia, and ICU care. The transient unresponsiveness was evaluated with negative imaging studies and an unremarkable LP. Cefepime was discontinued as there were no signs of systemic infection. The patient's abdominal distension may be related to Clostridioides difficile infection, and an abdominal CT scan is planned. Respiratory failure has improved, and the patient is currently stable without respiratory issues. Rhabdomyolysis has improved, and the patient's anemia will be managed in the ICU. The patient's lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP precautions are in place."
