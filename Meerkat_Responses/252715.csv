","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with anoxic brain injury, chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy in place, tongue laceration, and abdominal distension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of tongue biting, which may be due to seizure activity related to the anoxic injury. There is also a concern for hyperkalemia. The patient has a history of pancreatitis and is currently showing signs of fluid overload, possibly indicating congestive heart failure (CHF). Other medical conditions include diabetes, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and a history of a myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. We need to monitor his oxygen saturation levels and ensure proper ventilation parameters are maintained.

2. Seizure Activity: The patient's tongue biting could be a sign of seizure activity related to the anoxic brain injury. It is important to investigate further and consider the use of antiepileptic drugs if necessary.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels require immediate attention. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of hyperkalemia and appropriate treatment options.

4. Abdominal Distension: The patient's abdominal distension may indicate bowel obstruction or other gastrointestinal issues. Diagnostic imaging such as a KUB (kidney, ureter"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with anoxic brain injury, chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy in place, and a tongue laceration. The patient was admitted after a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during a ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation procedure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 103/70 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.25, a PaCO2 of 25 mmHg, a PaO2 of 104 mmHg, and a HCO3- of 32.5 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tracheostomy tube in place, non-verbal behavior, forked tongue with granulating tissue, prominent lip smacking/teeth grinding, rales in the anterior chest, regular heart rhythm, and moderate abdominal distension"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), and ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during VT ablation, resulting in anoxic brain injury. The patient presents with a tongue laceration from tongue biting and is seeking an oral appliance and possible placement in a different rehabilitation facility.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 79 bpm (78-93 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 96/62 mmHg to 127/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (15-63 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheostomy and ventilation support. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of -450 mL over the past 24 hours, with a total intake of 120 mL and total output of 570 mL. The patient is receiving several medications, including furosemide, heparin sodium, folate, thiamine, lisinopril, carvedilol, lipitor, aspirin, and prevacid.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal symptoms. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, soft and non"

 BACTEREMIA
 .H/O [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   43 yoM with anoxic brain injury, s/p PEG & trach, after a PEA arrest on
   the EP table in [**9-/2202**] (pt was undergoing VT ablation); admitted with
   stable tongue lac from biting tongue.  Awaiting mouth guard from
   occupational health. Pt also presents with abdominal distension and L
   UE swelling, although no pain to palpation.
   .
   # GPC Bacteremia:  High grade bacteremia with 6/6 bottles positive,
   speciation and sensitivities pending.
   - Continue Vanc
   - Daily surveillance cultures
   - Discuss further workup with EP cardiology, particularly regarding
   hardware in heart
   - Consider TTE vs TEE for ?endocarditis
   - Consider thrombus as possible source of bacteremia
   - Consider Gent if patient fails to improve or continues to spike
   .
   # Aspiration PNA:  Sputum cx c/w aspiration pna, pt noted to also have
   secretions and suspect high aspiration risk.
   - Continue Levo/Flagyl
   - CXR tomorrow
   .
   #. L UE Thrombus:  LUE US showed thrombus of brachial vein.
   - Discuss risk vs benefit of prophylaxis vs treatment of thrombus
   - Will likely need to be anti-coagulated
   .
   #. TONGUE LACERATION: On talking to the patient
s sister and mother
   further, it sounds like the patient
s tongue biting has been off and on
   for the last week or two since he was on medication
to bring down his
   K
   -- will check EEG to make sure tongue biting is not seizure activity
   given his h/o anoxic injury
   -- hct at baseline; recheck in am but does not need daily labs if going
   to be in house for some time
   -- contact occupational therapy re: mouth guard
   -- f/u appt with OM surgery per note ([**Hospital 3348**] Clinic [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11173**])
   -- Tylenol for comfort
   .
   #. S/P ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:
   - EEG to r/o seizure given lip smacking and teeth grinding,
   non-responsiveness to visual threat; f/u results
   -- cont trach/vent; requirements stable
   -- [**Name (NI) 5055**] (unclear what on at baseline; INR slightly elevated likely from
   nutrition)
   .
   #. ABD DISTENTION: unclear why he is distended; KUB ordered from Radius
   on [**11-18**] shows no evidence of obstruction. Two BMs overnight.
   Abdominal exam very tympanitic, with gush of air when peg tube
   accessed.  Continues to be non-tender. Reassuring labs (incl LFTs and
   lipase) and KUB.  Think pt
s distension likely due to air swallowing.
   -- will restart tube feeds
   -- optimize bowel regimen.
   .
   #. ? Hyperkalemia
   - d/c banana flakes from tube feeds
   -- will hold spironolactone for now.
   -- daily lytes
   .
   #. CHF: Pt appears volume up on exam, with sig peripheral edema (off
   baseline, per pt
s family), JVD difficult to assess.
   -- CXR to assess vol status
 consider more aggressive diuresis if
   evidence of fluid overload
 none seen
   -- changed home PO dose lasix to IV (home dose is 20 mg; will give 10
   mg IV given c/f gut edema and not absorbing PO
   -- holding spironolactone for now, while monitoring K
   -- restart lasix 20mg Qday
   -- repeat CXR to assess heart size (hopefully with better inspiration)
   .
   #. Fever of Tm 101 this AM ([**11-20**]):
   -- Will obtain c. diff, b. cxr, u. cxr, sputum cxr.
   .
   #. HYPERLIPIDEMIA, h/o STEMI:
   -- cont home regimen of ASA, carvedolol, lisinopril, lipitor
   .
   #. GERD: cont home omeprazole 40 mg QD
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- humalog SSI

   #. FEN:  Tube feeds
   -- cont home MVI, B1, folic acid
   -- per pt care referral form, on replete with fiber at 70 cc/hr, free
   water flushes 200 ml Q6 hours --> NPO for now given abd distention
   .
   #. ACCESS: one PIV on right

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, who underwent a procedure for ventricular tachycardia ablation and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with stable tongue laceration from biting his tongue, abdominal distension, and left upper extremity swelling. 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including bacteremia with GPC organism, aspiration pneumonia, left upper extremity thrombus, and potential seizure activity. 

The assessment and plan include continuing vancomycin for GPC bacteremia, daily surveillance cultures, discussing further workup with electrophysiology cardiology regarding hardware in the heart, considering transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for endocarditis, considering gentamicin if the patient fails to improve or continues to spike fevers, continuing levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, CXR tomorrow, discussing risk versus benefit of prophylaxis versus treatment of thrombus, and considering anticoagulation. 

Additionally, the patient's tongue laceration, possible seizure activity, abdominal distension, hyperkalemia, congestive heart failure (CHF), fever of unknown origin, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, feeding regimen, access, prophylaxis, and code status are also noted in the progress note."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   43 yoM with anoxic brain injury, s/p PEG & trach, after a PEA arrest on
   the EP table in [**9-/2202**] (pt was undergoing VT ablation); admitted with
   stable tongue lac from biting tongue.  Awaiting mouth guard from
   occupational health. Pt also presents with abdominal distension and L
   UE swelling, although no pain to palpation.
   .
   #. TONGUE LACERATION: On talking to the patient
s sister and mother
   further, it sounds like the patient
s tongue biting has been off and on
   for the last week or two since he was on medication
to bring down his
   K
   -- will check EEG to make sure tongue biting is not seizure activity
   given his h/o anoxic injury
   -- hct at baseline; recheck in am but does not need daily labs if going
   to be in house for some time
   -- contact occupational therapy re: mouth guard
   -- f/u appt with OM surgery per note ([**Hospital 3348**] Clinic [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11173**])
   -- Tylenol for comfort
   .
   #. S/P ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:
   -- cont trach/vent; requirements stable
   -- [**Name (NI) 5055**] (unclear what on at baseline; INR slightly elevated likely from
   nutrition)
   .
   #. ABD DISTENTION: unclear why he is distended; KUB ordered from Radius
   on [**11-18**] shows no evidence of obstruction. Two BMs overnight.
   Abdominal exam very tympanitic, with gush of air when peg tube
   accessed.  Continues to be non-tender. Reassuring labs (incl LFTs and
   lipase) and KUB.  Think pt
s distension likely due to air swallowing.
   -- will restart tube feeds
   -- optimize bowel regimen.
   .
   #. L UE swelling
   -- Obtain L UE US to r/u DVT
   .
   #. ? Hyperkalemia
   -- will hold spironolactone for now.
   -- daily lytes
   .
   #. CHF: Pt appears volume up on exam, with sig peripheral edema (off
   baseline, per pt
s family), JVD difficult to assess.
   -- CXR to assess vol status
 consider more aggressive diuresis if
   evidence of fluid overload
 none seen
   -- changed home PO dose lasix to IV (home dose is 20 mg; will give 10
   mg IV given c/f gut edema and not absorbing PO
   -- holding spironolactone for now, while monitoring K
   -- restart lasix 20mg Qday
   -- repeat CXR to assess heart size (hopefully with better inspiration)
   .
   #. Fever of Tm 101 this AM ([**11-20**]):
   -- Will obtain c. diff, b. cxr, u. cxr, sputum cxr.
   .
   #. HYPERLIPIDEMIA, h/o STEMI:
   -- cont home regimen of ASA, carvedolol, lisinopril, lipitor
   .
   #. GERD: cont home omeprazole 40 mg QD
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- humalog SSI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, who has undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy. He was admitted with stable tongue laceration from biting his tongue. The patient presents with abdominal distension and left upper extremity swelling, although no pain to palpation. 

The patient has been diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure and bacteremia. The source of infection is suspected to be oropharyngeal flora. He has an elevated temperature and has been treated with antibiotics. 

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood glucose level is significantly elevated. The imaging shows a left brachial vein thrombus with questionable minimal flow, which is new since the prior exam. 

The patient's physical examination reveals forked tongue from laceration with granulating tissue, prominent lip smacking/teeth grinding, clear to auscultation bilaterally, regular rhythm with no murmurs, and mild abdominal distension/firmness without tenderness. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 104.5°F, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/69 mmHg to 150/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's assessment includes tongue laceration, chronic respiratory failure, bacteremia,"

   the EP table in [**9-/2202**] (pt was undergoing VT ablation); admitted with
   stable tongue lac from biting tongue.  Awaiting mouth guard from
   occupational health. Pt also presents with abdominal distension and L
   UE swelling, although no pain to palpation.

   # GPC Bacteremia:  High grade bacteremia with 6/6 bottles positive,
   speciation and sensitivities pending.
   - Continue Vanc D2; f/u with ID re: course of treatment
   - Daily surveillance cultures
   - Discuss further workup with EP cardiology, particularly regarding
   hardware in heart
   - Consider TTE vs TEE for ?endocarditis
   - Consider thrombus as possible source of bacteremia
   - Consider Gent if patient fails to improve or continues to spike
   .
   # Aspiration PNA:  Sputum cx c/w aspiration pna, pt noted to also have
   secretions and suspect high aspiration risk.  Sputum growing
   respiratory flora and GNR; however, this is not uncommon in pts with a
   trach, so will d/c antibiotics given admission CXR did not show
   infiltrates.
   - D/C Levo/Flagyl, D3/7; restart if status declines clinically
   .
   #. L UE Thrombus:  LUE US showed thrombus of brachial vein.
   - Discuss risk vs benefit of prophylaxis vs treatment of thrombus
   - Currently received Lovenox for anti-coagulation; consider changing to
   SC Heparin if he will undergo procedures

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and a previous cardiac event. He was admitted with stable tongue laceration from biting his tongue. The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple medical complications.

The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by MRSA, which is a type of staphylococcal infection. He has been receiving vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole as antibiotics. The source of bacteremia could be considered, including thrombus, endocarditis, or gastrointestinal sources.

The patient also has respiratory failure, chronic, possibly due to his anoxic brain injury and subsequent tracheostomy. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia, but the initial chest X-ray did not show any infiltrates, so antibiotics have been discontinued.

The patient has a left upper extremity thrombus in the brachial vein. Prophylaxis with heparin sodium and enoxaparin (Lovenox) has been initiated. The risk versus benefit of treatment versus prophylaxis needs to be discussed.

The patient's tongue laceration is being managed with an EEG to rule out seizure activity due to his history of anoxic brain injury. Occupational therapy is being consulted for a mouth guard.

Abdominal distension is present, which may be due to air swallowing. The patient's labs are reassuring"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. The patient was admitted with a stable tongue laceration from biting his tongue and presents with abdominal distension and left upper extremity swelling, although without pain upon palpation.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require attention:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has high-grade bacteremia with 6/6 bottles positive, speciation and sensitivities pending. The patient is currently on vancomycin, and daily surveillance cultures are being performed. Further workup with electrophysiologist cardiology is needed, particularly regarding hardware in the heart, to consider endocarditis. The source of bacteremia could also be a thrombus.

2. Aspiration pneumonia (PNA): The patient has sputum culture consistent with aspiration PNA. The patient is already on levofloxacin and metronidazole, and a chest X-ray is planned for tomorrow.

3. Left upper extremity thrombus: A left upper extremity ultrasound showed a thrombus in the brachial vein. The patient may need to be anticoagulated, and the risk versus benefit of prophylaxis versus treatment of the thrombus should be discussed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, who was admitted with a tongue laceration. He has been in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's recent events include fever, positive blood culture for MRSA, and a brachial vein clot. He is currently on multiple antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has shown signs of respiratory failure and chronic aspiration pneumonia. He also has a thrombus in his left upper extremity and abdominal distension without evidence of obstruction. There are concerns regarding potential complications such as hyperkalemia, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, GERD, diabetes, and malnutrition. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for MRSA and is receiving antibiotics. There is a risk of ongoing infection and potential complications related to bacteremia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. This could lead to further deterioration in lung function and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Thrombus in Brachial Vein: The presence of a thrombus in the brachial vein indicates a risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and possible pulmonary embolism (PE) if the clot dislodges.
4. Abdominal Distension:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with anoxic brain injury and MRSA bacteremia. He has been off the ventilator and doing well. The patient is currently receiving Lovenox for a left upper extremity thrombosis. He developed a fever of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit and his blood cultures were taken. The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were Levofloxacin on 11/21 at 10:00 PM, Metronidazole on 11/22 at 12:00 AM, and Vancomycin on 11/22 at 07:45 AM. He is receiving prophylactic Heparin Sodium and Enoxaparin (Lovenox). Other medications include thiamine, MVI, Lipitor, ASA, Prevacide, Lasix, Flagyl, and Levoflox. There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history or review of systems.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/79 to 125/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on a T-piece for respiratory support and has a sinus rhythm. His weight remains unchanged at 86.9 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2485 mL and output of 978 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1507 mL. Other fluid inputs include TF at 1255 mL, IVF at 850 mL, and urine output of 978 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a T-piece with 100% oxygen saturation and an ABG result of ///25/. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not being assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment also not assessed. Lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose of 113 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, and platelet count of 292 K/uL. Other lab values are provided in the note.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Bacteremia - Continue vancomycin and stop Levofloxacin and Flagyl due to no evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure, chronic - No intervention required as the patient is off the ventilator and doing well.
3. Brachial vein thrombosis - Continue Lovenox.
4. Mural thrombus - No specific intervention mentioned.
5. Tongue laceration - Appliance available at the hospital for follow-up.
6. F/u on EEG to rule out seizure.
7. Chronic systolic heart failure - No specific intervention mentioned."

   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs:
   1. Would continue vancomycin 1gm IV q12
   2. Please check vanc trough before 4th dose, goal 15-20
   3. Recommend TEE to evaluate for ICD lead endocarditis
   4. Would check GGT to verify liver source of elevated alk phos,
   consider imaging of RUQ
   5. Please check 2 sets surveillance cultures today
   - EEG [**11-20**]: abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and disorganization
   of the background rhythm. This finding is consistent with a mild to
   moderate encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic, infection, and
   anoxia are common causes. No epileptiform discharges or lectrographic
   seizures are seen during this recording.
   - No neuro recs
   - NPO after midnight for TEE in the AM.
   - Spoke with prosthodontics specialist at [**Hospital1 1244**]--[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 927**]

   mouthpiece made, they will have to pay for it out of pocket ($3750) as
   the pt's insurance will likely not cover it, and also the attending

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), who presented with stable tongue lac from biting tongue. He has been admitted with abdominal distension and left upper extremity swelling, although there is no pain to palpation. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, left upper extremity thrombus, tongue laceration, anoxic brain injury, abdominal distension, hyperkalemia, congestive heart failure (CHF), hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, feeding tube, and access.

Based on the progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia with 6/6 bottles positive, speciation and sensitivities pending. This indicates a potential infection that needs further evaluation and treatment.
2. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which may require ongoing respiratory support and management.
3. Left upper extremity thrombus: The patient has a thrombus in the left upper extremity, which requires anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation and potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.
4. Abdominal distension: The patient's abdominal distension may be due to air swallowing or another underlying cause. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs:
   1. Would continue vancomycin 1gm IV q12
   2. Please check vanc trough before 4th dose, goal 15-20
   3. Recommend TEE to evaluate for ICD lead endocarditis
   4. Would check GGT to verify liver source of elevated alk phos,
   consider imaging of RUQ
   5. Please check 2 sets surveillance cultures today
   - EEG [**11-20**]: abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and disorganization
   of the background rhythm. This finding is consistent with a mild to
   moderate encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic, infection, and
   anoxia are common causes. No epileptiform discharges or lectrographic
   seizures are seen during this recording.
   - No neuro recs
   - NPO after midnight for TEE in the AM.
   - Spoke with prosthodontics specialist at [**Hospital1 1244**]--[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 927**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11200**], pager [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11201**]--and if family consents to having
   mouthpiece made, they will have to pay for it out of pocket ($3750) as
   the pt's insurance will likely not cover it, and also the attending
   will have to call to book the procedure, as it may require OR time.
   Discussed this with family, and they are considering more cost
   effective options, such as having his teeth pulled.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He was admitted with stable tongue laceration from biting his tongue. The patient presents with abdominal distension, left upper extremity swelling, and chronic respiratory failure. He has high-grade bacteremia with six out of six bottles positive, awaiting speciation and sensitivities. There is also a sputum culture showing growth of respiratory flora and Gram-negative rods. The patient has a left upper extremity thrombus and is currently receiving low molecular weight heparin for anticoagulation. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The abdominal X-ray does not show any evidence of obstruction. The patient's tongue laceration is likely due to teeth grinding and anxiety. He has a history of STEMI and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has high-grade bacteremia and a sputum culture growing respiratory flora and GNR. This indicates a potential risk of infection, which needs to be closely monitored and treated accordingly.
2. Thrombosis: The patient has a left upper extremity thrombus, which poses a risk for further clot formation and potential embolization.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory status due to aspiration pneumonia or other respiratory complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with anoxic brain injury post-cardiac arrest and MRSA bacteremia. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications and treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a history of chronic respiratory failure. His blood tests show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's neurological status is described as not attentive, not following simple commands, and not assessed for movement, tone, or response. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, and his current respiratory support with a T-piece and oxygen delivery device needs to be closely monitored to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
2. MRSA bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing MRSA infection, and it is essential to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy. Source control measures should be considered to identify and treat the source of the bacteremia.
3. Neurological impairment: The patient's neurological status indicates significant impairment, which may lead to further complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pneumonia due to immobility.
4. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows an overall positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent fluid-related complications such as pulmonary edema or"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to tongue biting and non-responsive behavior. This can lead to further complications such as infections or pressure ulcers.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia with positive blood cultures. This indicates the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, which can potentially lead to sepsis or other systemic infections.

3. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient is a chronic respiratory failure due to anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, and prolonged mechanical ventilation. This can lead to complications such as pneumonia or further respiratory distress.

4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia due to tracheostomy and secretions. This can result in lung infections and respiratory failure.

5. Left upper extremity thrombus: The patient has a thrombus in the left upper extremity, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

6. Abdominal distension: The patient has abdominal distension, which can be caused by air swallowing or another underlying condition. This can lead to complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

7. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia, although it is not present today. Elevated potassium levels can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

The patient has been admitted with stable tongue laceration from biting his tongue. The patient also presents with abdominal distension and left upper extremity swelling, although there is no pain upon palpation.

The patient has several medical issues, including impaired skin integrity, bacteremia, chronic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, left upper extremity thrombus, tongue laceration, anoxic brain injury, abdominal distension, possible hyperkalemia, congestive heart failure (CHF), hyperlipidemia (with a history of ST-elevation myocardial infarction), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, and malnutrition.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm (with a normal range of 77-120 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 124/75 mmHg (with a normal range of 85-148/62-103 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 14-27 breaths per minute)

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He was admitted with stable tongue laceration from biting his tongue and found to be bacteremic with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, left upper extremity thrombus, abdominal distention, congestive heart failure (CHF), hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, lorazepam, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and humalog SSI for diabetes management. He is also on tube feeds with fiber and free water flushes.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 117/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on a T-piece for respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal no abscess or abnormal enhancement in the neck region. A CT scan of the head shows stable reduction in [Doctor Last Name 734]-white"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He was admitted with a tongue laceration from biting his tongue and presented with abdominal distension, left upper extremity swelling, and respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical issues including MRSA bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, left upper extremity thrombus, tongue laceration, post-anoxic brain injury, abdominal distension, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to anoxic brain injury and tracheostomy. This condition can lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

2. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). If not properly treated, it can result in sepsis and septic shock.

3. Left Upper Extremity Thrombus: The presence of a thrombus in the left upper extremity vein increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if it dislodges and travels to the lungs.

4. Abdominal Distension: The cause of the patient's abdominal dist"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, and PEG tube placement after a cardiac arrest. He was admitted with a stable tongue lac from biting his tongue, found to be bacteremic with MRSA. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, a left upper extremity thrombus, and a tongue laceration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has active tongue bleeding and a history of biting his tongue, which could lead to further bleeding and potential need for transfusion.
2. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient was previously bacteremic with MRSA, and there is a concern for potential recurrence or spread of infection.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: Although the patient's aspiration pneumonia has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent aspiration due to the tracheostomy and high risk of aspiration.
4. Left Upper Extremity Thrombus: The patient has a thrombus in the left upper extremity vein, which may require anticoagulation therapy.
5. CHF: The patient exhibits signs of volume overload, including peripheral edema and difficulty assessing jugular venous distention. There is concern for congestive heart failure (CHF).
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of STEMI and continues to be at risk for cardiovascular complications related to hyperlipidemia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with anoxic brain injury, s/p PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), tracheostomy, and VT ablation. He was admitted with a tongue laceration from biting his tongue and was found to be bacteremic with MRSA. The patient has several medical complications and conditions including acute anemia, MRSA bacteremia, respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, left upper extremity thrombus, tongue laceration, anoxic brain injury, abdominal distension, congestive heart failure (CHF), hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, feeding, and access issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the MRSA bacteremia, development of new infections due to prolonged ICU stay, progression of respiratory failure leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further thrombus formation, worsening of CHF, uncontrolled diabetes, and complications related to the tracheostomy and PEG tubes.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms to promptly identify any changes or deteriorations in their condition. Timely interventions and appropriate management are crucial to prevent complications and improve the patient's overall health outcome."

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), tracheostomy, and VT ablation. He was admitted with a tongue laceration from biting his tongue, found to be bacteremic with MRSA. The patient has had several medical complications since admission, including acute anemia, MRSA bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, left upper extremity thrombus, tongue lac, chronic respiratory failure, abdominal distention, congestive heart failure (CHF), hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, and poor nutritional status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing, indicating a potential need for further evaluation and management.
2. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient initially had a high-grade bacteremia with MRSA, but subsequent cultures have been negative. However, ongoing monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are required.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: Although the patient's sputum culture showed respiratory flora and GNR, which is common in tracheostomy patients, there is still a concern for aspiration pneumonia. Continued surveillance and monitoring are necessary.
4. Left Upper Extremity Thrombus: The patient has a thrombus in the left upper extremity brachial vein. Long-term anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox for six"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 43-year-old male with anoxic brain injury, tongue biting/laceration, and MRSA bacteremia.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/56 mmHg to 137/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient has been intubated and is on a T-piece for respiratory support.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range.
- Imaging studies reveal opacification of the right sphenoid sinus, no obvious hypodense areas, and a reduction in [Doctor Last Name 734]-white matter differentiation.
- The patient has multiple medical conditions, including gastrointestinal bleeding, MRSA bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, left upper extremity thrombus, tongue laceration, anoxic brain injury, abdominal distension, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetes, and fenofibrate use.
- The patient's treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin antibiotics, stopping anticoagulation for now, providing pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, continuing tracheostomy and ventilation, holding TFs for now, and planning for return to LTAC after resolution of current issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient is at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding due to the presence of active tongue laceration and ongoing bleeding.
2. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, which can lead to recurrent infections if not properly managed.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for aspiration pneumonia due to tracheostomy and high aspiration risk.
4. Thrombus: The patient has a left upper extremity thrombus, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.
5. Abdominal Distension: The patient has abdominal distension, which may be due to air swallowing or another underlying cause. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
6. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient appears volume overloaded and has signs of congestive heart failure. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent worsening of symptoms.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and a previous myocardial infarction. Ongoing management is required to control lipid levels and reduce cardiovascular risk.
8. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease, which needs to be managed with appropriate medications.
9. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes, which requires ongoing management to maintain blood glucose levels within target range.
10. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has anoxic brain injury, which can result in long-term neurological complications. Ongoing neurological evaluation and management are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury and previous PEA arrest. He was admitted to the hospital for severe self-inflicted tongue laceration and had a complicated hospital course with MRSA bacteremia. The patient had teeth pulled yesterday morning and received a blood transfusion due to low hematocrit levels. His vital signs are stable, but he is currently on respiratory support using a T-piece. His peripheral pulses are not assessed, and his neurologic examination is incomplete. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and slightly abnormal kidney function. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, he has bacteremia, and he has chronic respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient has impaired skin integrity and bacteremia, indicating a potential risk for further infections.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and dependence on respiratory support may increase the risk of pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
3. Bleeding: The low platelet count could increase the risk of bleeding, especially considering the recent dental procedure.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests possible kidney dysfunction, which could be exacerbated by the blood transfusion.
5. Neurological issues: The incomplete neurologic examination raises concerns about potential neurological deficits or complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury and previous PEA arrest. He was admitted to the hospital for severe self-inflicted tongue laceration and has had a complicated hospital course, including MRSA bacteremia. The patient's recent events include teeth extraction by OMFS and a blood transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 112/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is unresponsive to commands or threats and has a forked tongue with no active bleeding visualized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of severe tongue laceration and recent teeth extraction, both of which can contribute to bleeding. The recent transfusion of PRBCs may also increase the risk of bleeding complications.
2. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, which can lead to systemic infection and complications if not properly treated.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a concern for aspiration pneumonia due to fever and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. Treatment for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been initiated.
4. Left Upper Extremity Thrombus: The patient has a thrombus in the left upper extremity,"
