   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man who presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient is currently in the ICU and is intubated with mechanical ventilation. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This requires close monitoring and adjustment of fluid administration and vasopressor support.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure, and there is evidence of mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. There is a need to optimize ventilator settings, ensure adequate oxygenation, and consider weaning off mechanical ventilation as tolerated.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine levels have increased from 1.1 at OSH to 1.4 here, indicating possible worsening renal function. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as fluid restriction and diuretics, should be considered.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by aggressive IV fluid administration or early renal failure. It is important to monitor electrolyte levels, acid-base balance, and renal function.

5. Hypothermia: The patient is persistently hypothermic, and the temperature on admission was 94.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Measures should be taken to rewarm the patient, including the use of warming devices"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Hypotensive overnight responsive to dopamine and increased volume.
   Dobutamine strated for inotropic support.
   CVP today 8-10 mmHg.
   Physical Examination
   As recorded.
   Medical Decision Making
   day 2 post large infero-posterior MI.  Hemodynamic status complex with
   probable evidence of RV infarction but low to normal right sided
   filling pressures despite large volume resuscitation.  Low SVR based on
   numbers formo cardiac cath possibly consistent [**Doctor Last Name 3897**] sepsis or SIRS
   related to large MI.  For now will continue moderate volume to keep CVP
   >8 and <15 and attempt to wean dopamine if SBP >100.
   Lung mass of uncertain cause - will follow.
   Plan to reduce sedation and extubate in next 24 hours.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Critical care due to hemodynamic instability, ventialtor.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to cardiogenic shock caused by the inferior STEMI and RV dysfunction. This requires careful monitoring and management with appropriate fluid resuscitation and inotropic support.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated in the setting of a code at OSH and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis as indicated by the ABG results. Close monitoring and titration of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine levels have increased from 1.1 to 1.4, suggesting possible ARF. Further evaluation and management are required, including close monitoring of renal function, appropriate fluid balance, and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially presented with a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which resolved with fluid resuscitation. Continued monitoring is essential to ensure that the acid-base balance does not deteriorate further.

5. Hypothermia: The patient was hypothermic upon admission, with a temperature of 94.7 degrees Celsius. It is important to monitor the patient's temperature closely and take appropriate measures to maintain normothermia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with limited medical history who presented to the hospital with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the right coronary artery (RCA). He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His initial acidosis improved overnight, allowing for a reduction in FiO2. However, he experienced increasing hypotension and required escalation of vasopressor support with dopamine and dobutamine. Fluid resuscitation was also administered. The patient's urine output has been low, and he is persistently hypothermic. An arterial line has been placed. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronary artery disease: The patient had an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He is dependent on vasopressors post-catheterization. Hold beta-blockers until hemodynamic stability is achieved, and then consider weaning off pressors. Administer aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose statin. Perform lipid panel and HbA1C for risk stratification.
2. Cardiac function: The patient's response to IV fluids suggests right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, possibly related to the ischemic territory. However, the central venous pressure (CVP) is low. Perform a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) today to assess cardiac function. Bolus IV fluid for low urine output"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) of the RCA (right coronary artery).
- The patient is intubated and overbreathing on the ventilator.
- Initially, the patient had acidosis, which improved overnight, allowing for weaning of FiO2.
- The patient experienced increasing hypotension, for which dopamine was started at a catheter level and increased up to 15ug/kg/min. The patient was also given fluids and dobutamine, resulting in a combination of dopamine at 8ug/kg/min and dobutamine at 5ug/kg/min.
- The patient received 4L fluids overnight.
- The patient's urine output was initially low around 30mL/hour but improved to 70mL/hour with boluses.
- The patient remained persistently hypothermic.
- An arterial line (A-line) was placed.
- The patient's vital signs included a temperature of 37.2C (98.9F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 87/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and low CVP indicate possible cardiogenic shock due to inferior STEMI and total occlusion of the RCA."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with a pulmonary nodule, myocardial infarction (AMI), hypotension, and hypothermia. The patient is receiving various medications including dobutamine, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65/78 mmHg to 132/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,305 mL and output of 1,462 mL, resulting in a balance of 3,843 mL. The patient's blood products total out is 1,462 mL, urine output is 1,232 mL, and NG output is 230 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, sodium of 125 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, and glucose of 125 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has an arterial line and multi-lumen line in place for monitoring and administration of medications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers due to the use of pantoprazole, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization, and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) from the arterial and multi-lumen lines. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent these complications."

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man who is currently in the ICU. He has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is stable, with controlled vital signs and adequate oxygenation. However, there are several medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Due to the patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): This is a type of pneumonia that occurs in patients who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and use of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
4. Pulmonary embolism: If a DVT dislodges and travels to the lungs, it can cause a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism.
5. Myocardial infarction: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which puts him at risk for a heart attack while in the ICU.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by medications or inadequate fluid management.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and sensory deprivation from being intubated can lead to delirium.
8. Stress ulcers: Intensive care unit admission is associated with an increased risk of stress ulcer development"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man who presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He is currently in the ICU and has been intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/46 to 132/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg, and fluid balance indicates an intake of 5,305 mL and output of 1,462 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 3,843 mL. The patient is receiving dobutamine and dopamine infusions, as well as sedation and analgesia.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver enzymes. However, the creatinine level is elevated at 1.2 mg/dL, and the platelet count is low at 264 K/uL. The patient's troponin-T level is slightly elevated at 0.66, indicating some cardiac injury.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's medical history includes inferior STEMI, RCA revascularization, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock with low CVP and hypot"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and subsequently underwent RCA revascularization. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical complications.

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient had a total occlusion of the RCA and previously underwent BMS placement. He is now dependent on dopamine due to post-cath complications. The plan includes holding beta-blockers until hemodynamic stability is achieved, weaning off pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IV fluid administration for preload augmentation, and starting ASA, Plavix, and a high-dose statin.

2. Pump dysfunction: The patient's heart is responding to IV fluids, suggesting RV dysfunction possibly related to the ischemic territory. However, the CVP is low, and the ejection fraction (EF) is unknown. A TTE has been ordered to further evaluate the pump function. The plan includes continuing aggressive IV fluid administration for preload augmentation and closely monitoring the patient's response.

3. Rhythm disturbances: The patient's rhythm has been NSR at present but has been increasingly tachycardic on the evening of admission. The plan includes monitoring the patient's heart rate, conducting regular ECGs, and considering a PA catheter if the patient remains hypotensive despite pressor therapy.

4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and on dopamine and dobutamine"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   - Pt. should not need ionotropic support, therefore will wean
   dobutamine and titrate up dopamine prn
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix, hold BB until HD stable
   -High dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath.
   -TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid for low urine output < 30cc
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR at present. Increasingly tachycardic on evening of
   admission.  Now improved
   -monitor on tele
   - Holding BB given hypotension
   .
   # Hypotension - Cardiogenic vs. septic vs. hypovolemic, on dopamine and
   dobutamine.  Now less likely cardiogenic given preserved systolic
   function on TTE.  Appears to be more distributive now.  Pulsus 10 on
   exam. No evidence PTX on exam or CXR.  Concern for sepsis, since was
   hypothermic to 95 on admission, cultures thus far negative.  Does have
   cavitary lesion in R lung apex and lesion in liver, ? abscess or other
   infectious process.  Sedation and positive pressure ventilation may
   also be contributing.
   - Monitor culture results
   - IVF boluses for CVP goal >15
   - transfuse 2 units pRBCs
   - Cont. pressors, wean dobutamine and titrate up dopamine as needed for
   goal MAP >60
   - a-line
   - if persistently hypotensive may need PA catheter for improved
   monitoring, likely L SC approach.
   .
   # ARF - Unclear baseline, cr 1.1 at OSH on admission, 1.4 here.  Cr
   imporved to 1.2 today after hydration.  Likely ARF in setting of
   hypovolemia given improving with IVF.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Respiratory failure - apparently intubated in setting of code at OSH.
    No known h/o lung disease.  ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and
   metabolic acidosis.
   - wean sedation
   - Trial PS today
   - Currently not protecting airway given [**Month (only) 202**]. gag, will follow with
   weaning sedation
   - If MS improves will attempt extubation today vs tomorrow pending
   decision regarding possible lung biopsy
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis, non AG. Resolved with fluids
   .
   # Hypothermia - Temp 94.7 on admission. Monitor culture data for
   sepsis, WBC curve and temperature curve.
   .
   # Lung/liver mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   - consult IP for possible transbronchial biopsy
   - ruling out for TB, [**1-11**] sputums sent
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm)
   - negative pressure room
   - OSH films loaded into PACS
   - discuss further PMH with family today when they arrive
   .
   #Psychosocial - pt found down, both he and his household decribed as
   unkept.  Unclear if safe alone at home
   -SW c/s
   -PT when able.
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented from the outside hospital (OSH) with an inferior STEMI, subsequent RCA revascularization, and currently depends on dopamine/dobutamine for hemodynamic support post catheterization. The patient has mild inferior hypokinesis on TTE.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Coronaries: The patient should not need ionotropic support, so weaning dobutamine and titrating up dopamine as needed. Hold BB until HD stable, high-dose statin, and lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. HbA1C is 5.7.

2. Pump: Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory, however, CVP is low, and RV function appeared normal on TTE yesterday. No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%. Bolus IV fluid for low urine output <30cc.

3. Rhythm: NSR at present. Increasingly tachycardic on evening of admission. Now improved. Monitor on tele, holding BB given hypotension.

4. Hypotension - Cardiogenic vs. septic vs. hypovolemic, on dopamine and dobutamine. Now less likely cardiogenic given preserved systolic function on TTE. Appears to be more distributive now. Pulsus 10 on exam"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited medical history who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI, subsequently undergoing RCA revascularization. He is currently in the ICU, dependent on dopamine and dobutamine, and has mild inferior hypokinesis on TTE. The patient's current vitals include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/46-78/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. He is also on midazolam and fentanyl infusions. The patient has received a total of 4 liters of fluid boluses and has had low CVPs with a MAP in the 50s. The patient's arterial blood gas shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient is already on dopamine and dobutamine, which suggests concern for sepsis, especially given his previous hypothermia and negative cultures. Further investigation into potential sources of infection,"

   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath.
   -TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid for low urine output < 30cc
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR at present. Increasingly tachycardic on evening of
   admission.  Now improved
   -monitor on tele
   - Holding BB given hypotension
   .
   # Hypotension - Cardiogenic vs. septic vs. hypovolemic, on dopamine and
   dobutamine.  Now less likely cardiogenic given preserved systolic
   function on TTE.  Appears to be more distributive now.  Pulsus 10 on
   exam. No evidence PTX on exam or CXR.  Concern for sepsis, since was
   hypothermic to 95 on admission, cultures thus far negative.  Does have
   cavitary lesion in R lung apex and lesion in liver, ? abscess or other
   infectious process.  Sedation and positive pressure ventilation may
   also be contributing.
   - Monitor culture results
   - IVF boluses for CVP goal >15
   - transfuse 2 units pRBCs
   - Cont. pressors, wean dobutamine and titrate up dopamine as needed for
   goal MAP >60
   - a-line
   - if persistently hypotensive may need PA catheter for improved
   monitoring, likely L SC approach.

   # ARF - Unclear baseline, cr 1.1 at OSH on admission, 1.4 here.  Cr
   imporved to 1.2 today after hydration.  Likely ARF in setting of
   hypovolemia given improving with IVF.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Respiratory failure - apparently intubated in setting of code at
   OSH.  No known h/o lung disease.  ABG here shows a mixed respiratory
   and metabolic acidosis.
   - wean sedation
   - Trial PS today
   - Currently not protecting airway given [**Month (only) 202**]. gag, will follow with
   weaning sedation
   - If MS improves will attempt extubation today vs tomorrow pending
   decision regarding possible lung biopsy

   # Lung/liver mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   - consult IP for possible transbronchial biopsy
   - ruling out for TB, [**1-11**] sputums sent

   As recorded
   Medical Decision Making
   Goals for today:
   1. Improve hypovolemic status and assess impact on hemodynamics. CVP
   low and HCT decreased to 24.7. Will get 2 units PRBCs and IV fluids. DC
   Dobutamine and hope ot wean off dopamine.
   2. Lighten sedation and move towards extubation unless pulmonary plans
   bronchoscopy
   3. Begin plan for diagnosis of cavitating lung mass. Pulmonary consult.
   Note concerrns given need for dual antiplatelet therapy for 30 days
   minimum.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of inferior STEMI, who underwent RCA revascularization. He is currently in the ICU due to cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
- Heart Rate: 74 bpm (with a range of 67-114 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 99/46 mmHg (with a range of 65/78-132/87 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 17 breaths per minute (with a range of 6-30 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on FiO2 of 40%
- Heart Rhythm: Sinus Rhythm

The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. 

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 9.3 K/uL
- Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.0 g/dL
- Sodium (Na+): 125 mg/dL
- Potassium (K+): 4.3 mEq/L
- Chloride (Cl-): 27.1%
- Creatinine (Cr): 1.2 mg/dL
- Tropin T: 0.66
- Glucose: 125 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and on dopamine and dobutamine. Initially, it was thought to be cardiogenic in nature, but now it appears to be more distributive. The patient has a pulsus paradox and no evidence of pulmonary edema or effusion on examination or chest X-ray. There is a concern for sepsis, especially given the patient's hypothermia on admission, negative cultures so far, and cavitary lesion in the right lung apex. The patient also has a lesion in the liver, which could be an abscess or another infectious process. Sedation and positive pressure ventilation may also contribute to the hypotension.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.1 mg/dL at OSH to 1.4 mg/dL here. The patient's ARF may be related to hypovolemia, as it improved with IV fluids. 
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to have respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia or other lung pathology. The ABG shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had metabolic acidosis, which resolved with fluids.
5. Hypothermia: The patient was hypothermic at admission with a temperature of"

   # Hypotension - Cardiogenic vs. septic vs. hypovolemic, currently on
   neosynephrine.  Now less likely cardiogenic given preserved systolic
   function on TTE.  Differential includes acute adrenal
   insufficiency.Appears to be more distributive now.  Pulsus 10 on exam.
   No evidence PTX on exam or CXR.  Concern for sepsis, since was
   hypothermic to 95 on admission, cultures thus far negative.  Does have
   cavitary lesion in R lung apex and lesion in liver, ? abscess or other
   infectious process.  Sedation and positive pressure ventilation may
   also be contributing.
   - Monitor culture results
   - cont IVF boluses, now s/p 3 units of pRBCs today
   - wean pressors today as tolerated
   - check free cortisol this AM, if low consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim to rule out
   adrenal insufficiency

   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease.  ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic
   acidosis.  Patient currently on FiO2 of 50% with assist control.
   Patient is not hypoventilated based on his ABG.
   - wean sedation this morning
   - attempt for SBP and possible extubation trial
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix
   -continue high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid for low urine output < 30cc
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR at present. Increasingly tachycardic on evening of
   admission.  Now improved
   -monitor on tele
   - Holding BB given hypotension
   .

   # ARF - Unclear baseline, cr 1.1 at OSH on admission, 1.4 here.  Cr
   imporved to 1.1 today after hydration.  Likely ARF in setting of
   hypovolemia given improving with IVF.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid nephrotoxins

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Events overnight reviewed. Continued hypotension with evidenc eof low
   volume and poor Hct response to 2 unit transfusion.  Episoded of
   hypoxia with tenacious secretions noted but otherwise did well on CPAP
   trial.
   Physical Examination
   As recorded. More awake and gross motor exam satisfactory and non
   localizing.
   CVP 5-9.
   Medical Decision Making
   Hypovolemia likely due to unrecognized bleeding source and probably
   secondary to cardiac cath. For now treatment is supportive with
   additional volume resuscitation and RBC transfusion to HCT >28.  Should
   be able to extubate and increase mobility, which ill assist in
   hypoxia/secretion control.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Ventilated, hemodynamci instability

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented to the emergency department with an inferior STEMI. He underwent RCA revascularization and was admitted to the CCU. The patient attempted to wean sedation yesterday but was unable to move his arms or legs. He was placed on CPAP and then back on assist control ventilation in the afternoon. Blood cultures are negative so far, and blood pressure has been labile all day. Dobutamine was discontinued and titrated up dopamine initially, but the patient's blood pressure would fluctuate between 200 systolic and 70s off. Norepinephrine is currently being used at a dose of 0.03 mcg/kg/min. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells after not responding to 2 units, and his central venous pressure (CVP) appears to have responded well to fluid repletion.

Infusions include norepinephrine, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. The patient also received heparin sodium prophylaxis. Other medications include aspirin, Plavix, and a high-dose statin. The patient's HbA1C level is 5.7.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension - The patient's hypotension is currently being treated with norepinephrine. The differential includes cardiogenic, septic, and hypovolemic causes. Given the"

   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   - Pt. should not need ionotropic support, therefore will wean
   dobutamine and titrate up dopamine prn
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix, hold BB until HD stable
   -High dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath.
   -TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid for low urine output < 30cc
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR at present. Increasingly tachycardic on evening of
   admission.  Now improved
   -monitor on tele
   - Holding BB given hypotension
   .
   # Hypotension - Cardiogenic vs. septic vs. hypovolemic, on dopamine and
   dobutamine.  Now less likely cardiogenic given preserved systolic
   function on TTE.  Appears to be more distributive now.  Pulsus 10 on
   exam. No evidence PTX on exam or CXR.  Concern for sepsis, since was
   hypothermic to 95 on admission, cultures thus far negative.  Does have
   cavitary lesion in R lung apex and lesion in liver, ? abscess or other
   infectious process.  Sedation and positive pressure ventilation may
   also be contributing.
   - Monitor culture results
   - IVF boluses for CVP goal >15
   - transfuse 2 units pRBCs
   - Cont. pressors, wean dobutamine and titrate up dopamine as needed for
   goal MAP >60
   - a-line
   - if persistently hypotensive may need PA catheter for improved
   monitoring, likely L SC approach.
   .
   # ARF - Unclear baseline, cr 1.1 at OSH on admission, 1.4 here.  Cr
   imporved to 1.2 today after hydration.  Likely ARF in setting of
   hypovolemia given improving with IVF.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Respiratory failure - apparently intubated in setting of code at
   OSH.  No known h/o lung disease.  ABG here shows a mixed respiratory
   and metabolic acidosis.
   - wean sedation
   - Trial PS today
   - Currently not protecting airway given [**Month (only) 202**]. gag, will follow with
   weaning sedation
   - If MS improves will attempt extubation today vs tomorrow pending
   decision regarding possible lung biopsy
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis, non AG. Resolved with fluids

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented from outside with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent RCA revascularization and is now in the ICU. The patient is dependent on dopamine and dobutamine for hemodynamic support, has mild inferior hypokinesis on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 45-50%. 

Potential Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Hypotension: The patient is on dopamine and dobutamine, suggesting hypotension. However, preserved systolic function on TTE makes cardiogenic hypotension less likely.
2. Sepsis: The patient was hypothermic to 95 degrees Fahrenheit on admission, cultures are negative so far, and there are cavitary lesions in the right lung apex and liver, raising concerns for an infectious process such as abscesses. Positive pressure ventilation and sedation may also contribute to hypotension.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure during a code at OSH. No known history of lung disease, and the ABG shows mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): Unclear baseline creatinine, with values of 1.1 at OSH and 1.4 here. Creatinine improved to 1.2 today after hydration"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   .
   # Hypotension - Cardiogenic vs. septic vs. hypovolemic, currently on
   neosynephrine.  Now less likely cardiogenic given preserved systolic
   function on TTE.  Differential includes acute adrenal
   insufficiency.Appears to be more distributive now.  Pulsus 10 on exam.
   No evidence PTX on exam or CXR.  Concern for sepsis, since was
   hypothermic to 95 on admission, cultures thus far negative.  Does have
   cavitary lesion in R lung apex and lesion in liver, ? abscess or other
   infectious process.  Sedation and positive pressure ventilation may
   also be contributing.
   - Monitor culture results
   - cont IVF boluses, now s/p 3 units of pRBCs today
   - wean pressors today as tolerated
   - check free cortisol this AM, if low consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim to rule out
   adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease.  ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic
   acidosis.  Patient currently on FiO2 of 50% with assist control.
   Patient is not hypoventilated based on his ABG.
   - wean sedation this morning
   - attempt for SBP and possible extubation trial
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix
   -continue high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid for low urine output < 30cc
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR at present. Increasingly tachycardic on evening of
   admission.  Now improved
   -monitor on tele
   - Holding BB given hypotension
   .
   .
   # ARF - Unclear baseline, cr 1.1 at OSH on admission, 1.4 here.  Cr
   imporved to 1.1 today after hydration.  Likely ARF in setting of
   hypovolemia given improving with IVF.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis, non AG. Resolved with fluids
   .
   # Hypothermia - Temp 94.7 on admission. Monitor culture data for
   sepsis, WBC curve and temperature curve.
   .
   # Lung/liver mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   Pulmonary not planning to bronch during this admission
   - ruling out for TB, [**2-11**] sputums sent
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm) appears
   - negative pressure room
   - OSH films loaded into PACS
   - discuss further PMH with family today when they arrive

","The patient is a 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented to the emergency department with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient has been in the ICU for ongoing stabilization and management of multiple medical complications.

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressure, requiring titration of dopamine and norepinephrine. There is a concern for cardiogenic, septic, or hypovolemic causes, but the preserved systolic function on TTE suggests less likely cardiogenic hypotension. Pulsus paradoxus is present, and there is concern for sepsis, given the negative cultures so far. Sedation and positive pressure ventilation may also be contributing factors.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated in the setting of a code and has no known history of lung disease. ABG shows mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The patient is currently on FiO2 of 50% with assist control and is not hypoventilated based on the ABG.
3. Coronaries: The patient had an IMI with total occlusion of RCA, which was treated with BMS placement. The patient is dependent on dopamine/dobutamine post catheterization and has mild inferior hypokinesis on TTE.

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   - Pt. should not need ionotropic support, therefore will wean
   dobutamine and titrate up dopamine prn
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix, hold BB until HD stable
   -High dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath.
   -TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid for low urine output < 30cc
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR at present. Increasingly tachycardic on evening of
   admission.  Now improved
   -monitor on tele
   - Holding BB given hypotension
   .
   # Hypotension - Cardiogenic vs. septic vs. hypovolemic, on dopamine and
   dobutamine.  Now less likely cardiogenic given preserved systolic
   function on TTE.  Appears to be more distributive now.  Pulsus 10 on
   exam. No evidence PTX on exam or CXR.  Concern for sepsis, since was
   hypothermic to 95 on admission, cultures thus far negative.  Does have
   cavitary lesion in R lung apex and lesion in liver, ? abscess or other
   infectious process.  Sedation and positive pressure ventilation may
   also be contributing.
   - Monitor culture results
   - IVF boluses for CVP goal >15
   - transfuse 2 units pRBCs
   - Cont. pressors, wean dobutamine and titrate up dopamine as needed for
   goal MAP >60
   - a-line
   - if persistently hypotensive may need PA catheter for improved
   monitoring, likely L SC approach.
   .
   # ARF - Unclear baseline, cr 1.1 at OSH on admission, 1.4 here.  Cr
   imporved to 1.2 today after hydration.  Likely ARF in setting of
   hypovolemia given improving with IVF.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Respiratory failure - apparently intubated in setting of code at
   OSH.  No known h/o lung disease.  ABG here shows a mixed respiratory
   and metabolic acidosis.
   - wean sedation
   - Trial PS today
   - Currently not protecting airway given [**Month (only) 202**]. gag, will follow with
   weaning sedation
   - If MS improves will attempt extubation today vs tomorrow pending
   decision regarding possible lung biopsy
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis, non AG. Resolved with fluids
   .
   # Hypothermia - Temp 94.7 on admission. Monitor culture data for
   sepsis, WBC curve and temperature curve.
   .
   # Lung/liver mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   - consult IP for possible transbronchial biopsy
   - ruling out for TB, [**1-11**] sputums sent
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm)
   - negative pressure room
   - OSH films loaded into PACS
   - discuss further PMH with family today when they arrive
   .
   #Psychosocial - pt found down, both he and his household decribed as
   unkept.  Unclear if safe alone at home
   -SW c/s
   -PT when able.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited past medical history who presented from OSH with an inferior STEMI, and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient is currently in the ICU and is dependent on dopamine and dobutamine for hemodynamic support post-catheterization. 

The patient's 24-hour events include attempts to wean sedation, opening eyes to voice but unable to move arms or legs, placement on CPAP and then back on AC in the afternoon, uptitrating dopamine as needed with excellent blood pressure control, negative urine and blood cultures, initiation of norepinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min due to labile blood pressure, administration of 3 units of packed red blood cells, and fluid resuscitation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/38 mmHg to 235/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus bradycardia. 

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, and liver function tests. However, the patient has an elevated troponin-T level and elevated lactate level.

The patient's assessment and plan include"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   .
   # Hypotension
 Pt s/p inferior STEMI, initially hypotensive requiring
   dopamine/dobutamine. Switched to levo.  Turned off yesterday am, pt
   extubated, later on became bradycardic and hypotensive. Was on levophed
   with labile BPs, now back on dopamine, and IVF for hypotensive.  Ddx
   for this new episode:  Less likely primarily cardiac as no evidence of
   ECG changes, increase in CEs, possibly in setting of vagal episode or
   aspiration.  Also on ddx is primary neurologic process, acute stroke,
   metastatic disease or anoxic brain injury.
   - Dopamine prn and IVF boluses for BP, needs new a-line today.
   - F/u cx, covering broadly with vanc/zosyn for asp pna, needs ID
   approval today, planned 8 day course.  Started evening of [**2-15**].
   - CT followed by MRI to eval above neuro issues, ? neuro c/s.
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease but CXR consistent with COPD and has clubbing one
   exam.  The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
   hypoventilating [**2-10**] his COPD and rib Fx from compressions. Also clearly
   tiring from respiratory effort. There does not seems to be a diffusion
   defect as he has oxygenated well throughout this hospitalization. Also
   a component of aspiration PNA is complicating and even etiologic to his
   presentation.
   - Extubated successfully on [**2166-2-15**].
   - ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis which had
   initially resolved but has returned now that he is extubated.
   - CXR consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL cavitary lesion
   which pre-dates his respiratory distress
   - Sputum Cx during intubation growing oropharyngeal flora consistent
   with aspiration PNA
   - Given above concerns for aspiration, started empirically on
   vanc+pip/tazo on the evening of [**2166-2-15**]
   - Patient currently on FiO2 of 50% with PEEP 5 and pressure support of
   10. He seems to be tolerating this well
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix, needs NGT vs PO trial today.
   -continue high dose statin on PO access available
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. This metabolic
   picture is consistent with poor nutrition and generally poor metabolic
   state
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: had episode of bradycardia last night resulting in code
   blue.  Does not appear to be a primary cardiac process.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   -w/u of respiratory issues as above.
   .
   # Lung mass

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Complex events overnight reviewed in detail with CCU team.
   Change in neuro exam post extubation
   Bradycardia arrest with evidence of high grade AV block with narrow
   compex QRS
   Probable aspiration pneumonia
   Physical Examination
   L sided neglect and flaccid weakness. Also ? R leg weakness. Unable to
   cooperate with sensory exam; No facial weaness.
   Awake and appears alert. He has speech but difficult to hear due to
   weak voice;
   Diffuse lung rhonchi;
   No change in cardiac exam;
   Medical Decision Making
   No evidenc eof recurrent ischemia or heart failure.
   Cause of change in neurologic exam and duration unclear. Of note he had
   similar bradycardia events prior to evidence of inferior STEMI.
   Ischemia not likley primary cause now and late for reperfusion
   arrhythmia.
   Primary respiratory event most likely althoughs ABGs reasonable before
   and after event- > acute aspiration or plugging.
   Primary neurlogic event also a possibility.
   Today airway and respiratory status seem stable on BiPap. Will
   reintubate if any change.
   For head CT today.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   >60 minutes face to face critical care overnight and today.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of inferior STEMI, who presented to the hospital with respiratory failure. He was intubated and treated for aspiration pneumonia, which was confirmed by sputum culture. The patient also had an episode of bradycardia resulting in a code blue, and his blood pressure has been labile. He has a history of COPD and clubbing, and his lungs show signs consistent with COPD and a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. He is currently on BiPAP and showing improvement in his respiratory status. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has flaccid limbs with depressed reflexes. He has metabolic acidosis, possibly due to aggressive IV fluids. The patient's coronary arteries show mild inferior hypokinesis, and there is a concern for lung mass and possible malignancy or TB. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for the aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive at times, requiring the use of vasopressors such as dopamine and dobutamine. This could indicate poor cardiac function or volume depletion.
2. Bradycardia: The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia leading to a code blue. The cause of this bradycardia is unclear, but it may be related to the aspiration pneumonia or a primary neurological event.
3. Respiratory failure:"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   .
   # Hypotension
 Pt s/p inferior STEMI, initially hypotensive requiring
   dopamine/dobutamine. Switched to levo.  Turned off yesterday am, pt
   extubated, later on became bradycardic and hypotensive. Was on levophed
   with labile BPs, now back on dopamine, and IVF for hypotensive.  Ddx
   for this new episode:  Less likely primarily cardiac as no evidence of
   ECG changes, increase in CEs, possibly in setting of vagal episode or
   aspiration.  Also on ddx is primary neurologic process, acute stroke,
   metastatic disease or anoxic brain injury.
   - Dopamine prn and IVF boluses for BP, needs new a-line today.
   - F/u cx, covering broadly with vanc/zosyn for asp pna, needs ID
   approval today, planned 8 day course.  Started evening of [**2-15**].
   - CT followed by MRI to eval above neuro issues, ? neuro c/s.
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease but CXR consistent with COPD and has clubbing one
   exam.  The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
   hypoventilating [**2-10**] his COPD and rib Fx from compressions. Also clearly
   tiring from respiratory effort. There does not seems to be a diffusion
   defect as he has oxygenated well throughout this hospitalization. Also
   a component of aspiration PNA is complicating and even etiologic to his
   presentation.
   - Extubated successfully on [**2166-2-15**].
   - ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis which had
   initially resolved but has returned now that he is extubated.
   - CXR consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL cavitary lesion
   which pre-dates his respiratory distress
   - Sputum Cx during intubation growing oropharyngeal flora consistent
   with aspiration PNA
   - Given above concerns for aspiration, started empirically on
   vanc+pip/tazo on the evening of [**2166-2-15**]
   - Patient currently on FiO2 of 50% with PEEP 5 and pressure support of
   10. He seems to be tolerating this well
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix, needs NGT vs PO trial today.
   -continue high dose statin on PO access available
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. This metabolic
   picture is consistent with poor nutrition and generally poor metabolic
   state
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: had episode of bradycardia last night resulting in code
   blue.  Does not appear to be a primary cardiac process.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   -w/u of respiratory issues as above.
   .
   # Lung mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   Pulmonary not planning to bronch during this admission.
   - ruling out for TB, [**3-11**] sputums sent
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm), read as negative
   - negative pressure room, until AFBs read.
   - IP [**Name (NI) 1850**], no role for bronch in the acute post MI setting.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt with ongoing poor orientation and not fully
   communicative. Improved post-extubation. Nevertheless, has ongoing
   flaccid limbs and depressed reflexes. Could be consistent with ICU
   neuropathy v anoxic brain injury or CVA.
   -CT/MRI as above.
   .
   # Acidosis, mixed respiratory and metabolic. Metabolic is
   hyperchloremic non-AG acidosis. No ARF or diarrhea, likely in setting
   of aggressive IVF with NS.
   -Substitute LR for IVF.
   .
   #Psychosocial - pt found down, both he and his household decribed as
   unkept.  Unclear if safe alone at home

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited known medical problems. He presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission.

1. Hypotension: The patient initially required dopamine and dobutamine for hypotension but is now back on dopamine due to recurrent hypotension. The differential diagnosis includes cardiac causes, neurologic causes, acute stroke, metastatic disease, or anoxic brain injury.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated during a code at OSH due to respiratory failure. There is no known history of lung disease, but the chest X-ray shows findings consistent with COPD and a rib fracture from chest compressions. The patient also has clubbing of the fingers. The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be due to hypoventilation of COPD, aspiration pneumonia, or a diffusion defect.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of oropharyngeal flora in sputum cultures and a cavitary lesion on chest X-ray. He was started empirically on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

4. Coronaries: The patient had an inferior myocardial infarction with total occlusion of the RCA, which was treated with a bare-metal stent (BMS)."

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   .
   # Shock/Hypotension - Cardiogenic vs. septic vs. hypovolemic, currently
   on dopamine.  Now less likely cardiogenic given preserved systolic
   function on TTE.  Differential includes acute adrenal insufficiency but
   cortisol level was WNL. .Appears to be more distributive now.  Pulsus
   10 on exam. No evidence PTX on exam or CXR.  Concern for sepsis, since
   was hypothermic to 95 on admission, cultures thus far negative, but CXR
   concerning for aspiration PNA.  Does have cavitary lesion in R lung
   apex.
   - Monitor culture results
   - cont IVF boluses
   - wean pressors today as tolerated
   - Continue BiPAP for now with minimal PEEP to prevent worsening
   hypotension from poor venous return
   - CODE BLUE on [**2166-2-15**]. Developed bradycardia and hypotension overnight.
   Seemed vagal ? [**2-10**] mucous plugging. Trending CEs for evidence of
   recurrent coronary event. Responded to atropine and pressors. Chest
   compressions were given. His recurrent LOCs could be due to these vagal
   events of unclear etiology
   - Currently on dopamine  for pressure support as BP was very labile on
   norepi after his CODE BLUE on [**2166-2-15**]
   - Concern for aspiration PNA and component of sepsis. Started
   empirically on vanco+pip/tazo on the evening of [**2166-2-15**].
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease but CXR consistent with COPD and has clubbing one
   exam.  The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
   hypoventilating [**2-10**] his COPD and rib Fx from compressions. Also clearly
   tiring from respiratory effort. There does not seems to be a diffusion
   defect as he has oxygenated well throughout this hospitalization. Also
   a component of aspiration PNA is complicating and even etiologic to his
   presentation.
   - Extubated successfully on [**2166-2-15**].
   - ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis which had
   initially resolved but has returned now that he is extubated.
   - CXR consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL cavitary lesion
   which pre-dates his respiratory distress
   - Sputum Cx during intubation growing oropharyngeal flora consistent
   with aspiration PNA
   - Given above concerns for aspiration, started empirically on
   vanc+pip/tazo on the evening of [**2166-2-15**]
   - Patient currently on FiO2 of 50% with PEEP 5 and pressure support of
   10. He seems to be tolerating this well
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix
   -continue high dose statin on PO access available
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. This metabolic
   picture is consistent with poor nutrition and generally poor metabolic
   state
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR at present. Increasingly tachycardic on evening of
   admission.  Now improved
   -monitor on tele
   - Holding BB given hypotension
   .
   # Lung mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   Pulmonary not planning to bronch during this admission
   - ruling out for TB, [**2-11**] sputums sent
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm) appears NL
   - negative pressure room
   - OSH films loaded into PACS
   - discuss further PMH with family today when they arrive
   - AFBs x 3 pending
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt with ongoing poor orientation and not fully
   communicative. Improved post-extubation. Nevertheless, has ongoing
   flaccid limbs and depressed reflexes. Could be consistent with ICU
   neuropathy v anoxic brain injury or CVA.
   .
   # ARF - Unclear baseline, cr 1.1 at OSH on admission, 1.4 here.  Cr
   imporved to 1.1 today after hydration.  Likely ARF in setting of
   hypovolemia given improving with IVF.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis, non AG. Resolved with fluids. Recurred with
   multiple boluses. Complicated by some degree of respiratory acidosis.
   .
   # Hypothermia - Temp 94.7 on admission. Monitor culture data for
   sepsis, WBC curve and temperature curve.
   .
   #Psychosocial - pt found down, both he and his household decribed as
   unkept.  Unclear if safe alone at home
   -SW c/s
   -PT when able.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented from the outside hospital (OSH) with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequently underwent right coronary artery (RCA) revascularization. The patient is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) with multiple medical complications.

1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with shock/hypotension, which is now less likely to be cardiogenic given preserved systolic function on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE). The differential diagnosis includes distributive shock (e.g., septic shock), hypovolemic shock, or acute adrenal insufficiency. However, the cortisol level was within normal limits, making acute adrenal insufficiency less likely. There is concern for sepsis, as the patient was hypothermic upon admission, cultures are pending, and the chest X-ray is concerning for aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient has also developed bradycardia and hypotension overnight, which responded to atropine and pressors. Chest compressions were given due to recurrent loss of consciousness (LOCs), which could be due to these vagal events of unclear etiology. The patient is currently on dopamine for pressure support as the blood pressure was very labile on norepinephrine after the code blue event on 02/15.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated"

   - Extubated with stable sats and tachypnea to 25-30 on shovel mask
   - CODE BLUE for bradycardia and hypotension. Chest compressions were
   delivered. Responded to atropine and norepi + IVF. Seems like may have
   been a vagal event
   - BPs labile to >200 on norepi so switched to dopamine with stable SBPs

   .
   # Shock/Hypotension - Cardiogenic vs. septic vs. hypovolemic, currently
   on dopamine.  Now less likely cardiogenic given preserved systolic
   function on TTE.  Differential includes acute adrenal insufficiency but
   cortisol level was WNL. .Appears to be more distributive now.  Pulsus
   10 on exam. No evidence PTX on exam or CXR.  Concern for sepsis, since
   was hypothermic to 95 on admission, cultures thus far negative, but CXR
   concerning for aspiration PNA.  Does have cavitary lesion in R lung
   apex.
   - Monitor culture results
   - cont IVF boluses
   - wean pressors today as tolerated
   - Continue BiPAP for now with minimal PEEP to prevent worsening
   hypotension from poor venous return
   - CODE BLUE on [**2166-2-15**]. Developed bradycardia and hypotension overnight.
   Seemed vagal ? [**2-10**] mucous plugging. Trending CEs for evidence of
   recurrent coronary event. Responded to atropine and pressors. Chest
   compressions were given. His recurrent LOCs could be due to these vagal
   events of unclear etiology
   - Currently on dopamine  for pressure support as BP was very labile on
   norepi after his CODE BLUE on [**2166-2-15**]
   - Concern for aspiration PNA and component of sepsis. Started
   empirically on vanco+pip/tazo on the evening of [**2166-2-15**].
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease but CXR consistent with COPD and has clubbing one
   exam.  The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
   hypoventilating [**2-10**] his COPD and rib Fx from compressions. Also clearly
   tiring from respiratory effort. There does not seems to be a diffusion
   defect as he has oxygenated well throughout this hospitalization. Also
   a component of aspiration PNA is complicating and even etiologic to his
   presentation.
   - Extubated successfully on [**2166-2-15**].
   - ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis which had
   initially resolved but has returned now that he is extubated.
   - CXR consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL cavitary lesion
   which pre-dates his respiratory distress
   - Sputum Cx during intubation growing oropharyngeal flora consistent
   with aspiration PNA
   - Given above concerns for aspiration, started empirically on
   vanc+pip/tazo on the evening of [**2166-2-15**]
   - Patient currently on FiO2 of 50% with PEEP 5 and pressure support of
   10. He seems to be tolerating this well
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix
   -continue high dose statin on PO access available
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. This metabolic
   picture is consistent with poor nutrition and generally poor metabolic
   state
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR at present. Increasingly tachycardic on evening of
   admission.  Now improved
   -monitor on tele
   - Holding BB given hypotension
   .
   # Lung mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   Pulmonary not planning to bronch during this admission
   - ruling out for TB, [**2-11**] sputums sent
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm) appears NL
   - negative pressure room
   - OSH films loaded into PACS
   - discuss further PMH with family today when they arrive
   - AFBs x 3 pending
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt with ongoing poor orientation and not fully
   communicative. Improved post-extubation. Nevertheless, has ongoing
   flaccid limbs and depressed reflexes. Could be consistent with ICU
   neuropathy v anoxic brain injury or CVA.
   .
   # ARF - Unclear baseline, cr 1.1 at OSH on admission, 1.4 here.  Cr
   imporved to 1.1 today after hydration.  Likely ARF in setting of
   hypovolemia given improving with IVF.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis, non AG. Resolved with fluids. Recurred with
   multiple boluses. Complicated by some degree of respiratory acidosis.
   .
   # Hypothermia - Temp 94.7 on admission. Monitor culture data for
   sepsis, WBC curve and temperature curve.
   .
   #Psychosocial - pt found down, both he and his household decribed as
   unkept.  Unclear if safe alone at home
   -SW c/s
   -PT when able.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented from outside with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and shock/hypotension. The patient has been intubated and extubated multiple times, with each episode showing a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-203 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right compared to the left, coarse breath sounds overall, and poor air movement. Neurological examination shows flaccid extremities, purposeful movements of the right upper extremity, and opening eyes with nodding on commands.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, sodium of 112 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, and a glucose level of 105 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.27, pCO2 of 52, pO2 of 76, HCO3 of 25, and base excess of -3.

The patient's current medications include dopamine, vancomycin, piperacillin-t"

   .
   # Hypotension
 Pt s/p inferior STEMI, initially hypotensive requiring
   dopamine/dobutamine. Switched to levo.  Turned off yesterday am, pt
   extubated, later on became bradycardic and hypotensive. Was on levophed
   with labile BPs, now back on dopamine, and IVF for hypotensive.  Ddx
   for this new episode:  Less likely primarily cardiac as no evidence of
   ECG changes, increase in CEs, possibly in setting of vagal episode or
   aspiration.  Also on ddx is primary neurologic process, acute stroke,
   metastatic disease or anoxic brain injury.
   - Dopamine prn and IVF boluses for BP, needs new a-line today.
   - F/u cx, covering broadly with vanc/zosyn for asp pna, needs ID
   approval today, planned 8 day course.  Started evening of [**2-15**].
   - CT followed by MRI to eval above neuro issues, ? neuro c/s.
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease but CXR consistent with COPD and has clubbing one
   exam.  The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
   hypoventilating [**2-10**] his COPD and rib Fx from compressions. Also clearly
   tiring from respiratory effort. There does not seems to be a diffusion
   defect as he has oxygenated well throughout this hospitalization. Also
   a component of aspiration PNA is complicating and even etiologic to his
   presentation.
   - Extubated successfully on [**2166-2-15**].
   - ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis which had
   initially resolved but has returned now that he is extubated.
   - CXR consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL cavitary lesion
   which pre-dates his respiratory distress
   - Sputum Cx during intubation growing oropharyngeal flora consistent
   with aspiration PNA
   - Given above concerns for aspiration, started empirically on
   vanc+pip/tazo on the evening of [**2166-2-15**]
   - Patient currently on FiO2 of 50% with PEEP 5 and pressure support of
   10. He seems to be tolerating this well
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix, needs NGT vs PO trial today.
   -continue high dose statin on PO access available
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. This metabolic
   picture is consistent with poor nutrition and generally poor metabolic
   state
   - HbA1C 5.7

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited medical history who presented from outside with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He has been in the ICU for several days, experiencing multiple complications. These include hypotension requiring vasopressors, respiratory failure requiring intubation and extubation, COPD with a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe, aspiration pneumonia, altered mental status, mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and potential coronary artery disease. The patient's condition remains unstable, and several potential medical complications may arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of STEMI and RCA revascularization indicates underlying coronary artery disease. His current dependence on vasopressors suggests possible cardiac dysfunction. There is a risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial ischemia.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has been intubated and extubated multiple times, indicating significant respiratory distress. He has COPD with a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe, which may be due to infection or malignancy. The risk of respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, aspiration pneumonia, or worsening lung lesions remains high.

3. Neurological Complications: The patient exhibits altered mental status and poor orientation, which could be attributed to ICU neuropathy, anoxic brain injury, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   # Hypotension
 Pt s/p inferior STEMI, initially hypotensive requiring
   dopamine/dobutamine. Had episode of hypotension/bradycardia [**2-15**] during
   which code was called, appeared to be in setting of either vagal
   episode or aspiration PNA.  Continues to have small pressor
   requirement.  Initially was fluid responsive.  Unclear if persistently
   hypotensive due to cardiogenic shock (unlikely given TTE) vs other
   potential etiologies.  ? if some central process is playing a role.
   - Dopamine prn and IVF boluses for BP.
   - F/u cx, covering broadly with vanc/zosyn for asp pna, planned 8 day
   course.  Started evening of [**2-15**].
   - CT without acute process.  Consider MRI
   -[**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test, check TSH.
   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease but CXR consistent with COPD and has clubbing one
   exam.  The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
   hypoventilating [**2-10**] his COPD and rib Fx from compressions. Also clearly
   tiring from respiratory effort. There does not seems to be a diffusion
   defect as he has oxygenated well throughout this hospitalization. Also
   a component of aspiration PNA is complicating and even etiologic to his
   presentation.
   - Extubated successfully on [**2166-2-15**], tolerating facemask.  Wean down 02
   as tolerated.
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - CXR  from [**2-15**] consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL
   cavitary lesion which pre-dates his respiratory distress.  Given above
   concerns for aspiration, started empirically on vanc+pip/tazo on the
   evening of [**2166-2-15**]
   - f/u final AFB, remove respiratory precautions once finalized as
   negative.
   -pulmonary toilet, reposition/sit up in bed today.
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.  Still with persistent pressor requirement.  Pt is I/O even
   since midnight.  Was initially fluid responsive.  Seems to be less so
   now, although not very positive last 24 hours.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -ASA, plavix
   -high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. This metabolic
   picture is consistent with poor nutrition and generally poor metabolic
   state
   - HbA1C 5.7
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: Pt with ongoing poor
   orientation and not fully communicative. Improved post-extubation.
   Nevertheless, has ongoing flaccid limbs and depressed reflexes.
   Distribution with b/l LE and LUE?RUE is not anatomic in terms of an
   identifiable neurologic lesion.  More likely a more diffuse process,
   possibly ICU myopathy
   -aggressive nutritional support
   -Check B12, folate, RPR, TSH (B12, folate TSH normal at OSH
   -thiamine repletion
   -hold off on MRI given difficulty with travel, lying flat.  Consider
   this with neuro c/s if doesn
t improve
   -mobilize as soon as possible.
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   -no BB, ACEI while on pressors
   # RHYTHM: had episode of bradycardia [**2-15**] resulting in code blue.  Did
   not appear to be a primary cardiac process.  ECG this morning with
   various p-wave morphologies, potentially in setting of respiratory
   compromise.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   -w/u of respiratory issues as above.
   # Lung mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   Pulmonary not planning to bronch during this admission.
   - ruling out for TB, [**3-11**] sputums sent, 3 prelim negative.
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm), read as negative
   - negative pressure room, until AFBs read
   - IP [**Name (NI) 1850**], no role for bronch in the acute post MI setting.
   FEN: Able to take pills, speech and swallow eval today, otherwise will
   need NGT. Maintenance IVF with boluses for volume. Replete lytes prn.
   ACCESS: LIJ removed, RIJ placed [**2-13**],
   PROPHYLAXIS:  Hep SC, bowel regimen, PPI IV, switch to PO when
   tolerating.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Respiratory status relatively stable based on ABGs and work of
   breathing.
   Heart rate occasionally slow with drop in systolic pressure responded
   to dopamine.
   Possible vasodilatory hypotension with or without unexplained increased
   vagal tone.
   Head CT negative for major bleed or mass effect.
   Continue current course and close CCU observation for hemodynamic and
   neuro signs.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited medical history who presented from outside with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He was initially hypotensive and required dopamine/dobutamine, and had an episode of hypotension/bradycardia during which a code was called. The patient continues to have small pressor requirements and is currently on dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. He has been extubated and tolerating facemask, but with some difficulty weaning off oxygen. The patient has clubbing on examination and a history of COPD, and his respiratory failure etiology is unclear. He has a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe consistent with aspiration pneumonia, for which he is being empirically covered with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's coronary arteries are diseased due to a total occlusion of the RCA, for which he underwent stenting. He has mild inferior hypokinesis on TTE and persistent pressor requirement. The patient's mental status is altered, with poor orientation and communication, but has improved post-extubation. He also exhibits flaccid limbs and depressed reflexes, which may be due to ICU myopathy. His lipid panel shows low LDL and HDL levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   .
   # Hypotension
 Pt s/p inferior STEMI, initially hypotensive requiring
   dopamine/dobutamine. Switched to levo.  Turned off yesterday am, pt
   extubated, later on became bradycardic and hypotensive. Was on levophed
   with labile BPs, now back on dopamine, and IVF for hypotensive.  Ddx
   for this new episode:  Less likely primarily cardiac as no evidence of
   ECG changes, increase in CEs, possibly in setting of vagal episode or
   aspiration.  Also on ddx is primary neurologic process, acute stroke,
   metastatic disease or anoxic brain injury.
   - Dopamine prn and IVF boluses for BP, needs new a-line today.
   - F/u cx, covering broadly with vanc/zosyn for asp pna, needs ID
   approval today, planned 8 day course.  Started evening of [**2-15**].
   - CT followed by MRI to eval above neuro issues, ? neuro c/s.
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease but CXR consistent with COPD and has clubbing one
   exam.  The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
   hypoventilating [**2-10**] his COPD and rib Fx from compressions. Also clearly
   tiring from respiratory effort. There does not seems to be a diffusion
   defect as he has oxygenated well throughout this hospitalization. Also
   a component of aspiration PNA is complicating and even etiologic to his
   presentation.
   - Extubated successfully on [**2166-2-15**].
   - ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis which had
   initially resolved but has returned now that he is extubated.
   - CXR consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL cavitary lesion
   which pre-dates his respiratory distress
   - Sputum Cx during intubation growing oropharyngeal flora consistent
   with aspiration PNA
   - Given above concerns for aspiration, started empirically on
   vanc+pip/tazo on the evening of [**2166-2-15**]
   - Patient currently on FiO2 of 50% with PEEP 5 and pressure support of
   10. He seems to be tolerating this well
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Wean pressors as tolerated, favoring aggressive IVF for preload
   augmentation.
   -ASA, plavix, needs NGT vs PO trial today.
   -continue high dose statin on PO access available
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. This metabolic
   picture is consistent with poor nutrition and generally poor metabolic
   state
   - HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: had episode of bradycardia last night resulting in code
   blue.  Does not appear to be a primary cardiac process.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   -w/u of respiratory issues as above.
   .
   # Lung mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   Pulmonary not planning to bronch during this admission.
   - ruling out for TB, [**3-11**] sputums sent
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm), read as negative
   - negative pressure room, until AFBs read.
   - IP [**Name (NI) 1850**], no role for bronch in the acute post MI setting.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt with ongoing poor orientation and not fully
   communicative. Improved post-extubation. Nevertheless, has ongoing
   flaccid limbs and depressed reflexes. Could be consistent with ICU
   neuropathy v anoxic brain injury or CVA.
   -CT/MRI as above.
   .
   # Acidosis, mixed respiratory and metabolic. Metabolic is
   hyperchloremic non-AG acidosis. No ARF or diarrhea, likely in setting
   of aggressive IVF with NS.
   -Substitute LR for IVF.
   .
   #Psychosocial - pt found down, both he and his household decribed as
   unkept.  Unclear if safe alone at home
   -SW c/s
   -PT when able.
   -family discussion
   .
   FEN: PO trial today, SLP ordered. NGT will need to be placed If fails.
   IVF prn, replete lytes prn.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of full code status and is currently on dopamine infusion at 4 mcg/kg/min. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/48 to 181/140 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological exam reveals movement in the right upper extremity, some movement in the left upper extremity, and limited lower extremity movement. The patient tolerated taking oral Plavix and was able to wear a facemask for 50%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within a relatively stable range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction. Given the ongoing chest pain and elevated cardiac markers, there is a risk of further complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary status is concerning, with a pulmonary nodule present on imaging. This could indicate pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory distress and sepsis.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, particularly in the lower extremities. If left untreated, DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism.

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   # Hypotension
 Pt s/p inferior STEMI, initially hypotensive requiring
   dopamine/dobutamine. Had episode of hypotension/bradycardia [**2-15**] during
   which code was called, appeared to be in setting of either vagal
   episode or aspiration PNA.  Continues to have small pressor
   requirement.  Initially was fluid responsive.  Unclear if persistently
   hypotensive due to cardiogenic shock (unlikely given TTE) vs other
   potential etiologies.  ? if some central process is playing a role.
   - Dopamine prn and IVF boluses for BP.
   - F/u cx, covering broadly with vanc/zosyn for asp pna, planned 8 day
   course.  Started evening of [**2-15**].
   - CT without acute process.  Consider MRI
   -[**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test, check TSH.
   # Respiratory failure - intubated in setting of code at OSH.  No known
   h/o lung disease but CXR consistent with COPD and has clubbing one
   exam.  The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
   hypoventilating [**2-10**] his COPD and rib Fx from compressions. Also clearly
   tiring from respiratory effort. There does not seems to be a diffusion
   defect as he has oxygenated well throughout this hospitalization. Also
   a component of aspiration PNA is complicating and even etiologic to his
   presentation.
   - Extubated successfully on [**2166-2-15**], tolerating facemask.  Wean down 02
   as tolerated.
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - CXR  from [**2-15**] consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL
   cavitary lesion which pre-dates his respiratory distress.  Given above
   concerns for aspiration, started empirically on vanc+pip/tazo on the
   evening of [**2166-2-15**]
   - f/u final AFB, remove respiratory precautions once finalized as
   negative.
   -pulmonary toilet, reposition/sit up in bed today.
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.  Still with persistent pressor requirement.  Pt is I/O even
   since midnight.  Was initially fluid responsive.  Seems to be less so
   now, although not very positive last 24 hours.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -ASA, plavix
   -high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. This metabolic
   picture is consistent with poor nutrition and generally poor metabolic
   state
   - HbA1C 5.7
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: Pt with ongoing poor
   orientation and not fully communicative. Improved post-extubation.
   Nevertheless, has ongoing flaccid limbs and depressed reflexes.
   Distribution with b/l LE and LUE?RUE is not anatomic in terms of an
   identifiable neurologic lesion.  More likely a more diffuse process,
   possibly ICU myopathy
   -aggressive nutritional support
   -Check B12, folate, RPR, TSH (B12, folate TSH normal at OSH
   -thiamine repletion
   -hold off on MRI given difficulty with travel, lying flat.  Consider
   this with neuro c/s if doesn
t improve
   -mobilize as soon as possible.
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   -no BB, ACEI while on pressors
   # RHYTHM: had episode of bradycardia [**2-15**] resulting in code blue.  Did
   not appear to be a primary cardiac process.  ECG this morning with
   various p-wave morphologies, potentially in setting of respiratory
   compromise.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   -w/u of respiratory issues as above.
   # Lung mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   Pulmonary not planning to bronch during this admission.
   - ruling out for TB, [**3-11**] sputums sent, 3 prelim negative.
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm), read as negative
   - negative pressure room, until AFBs read
   - IP [**Name (NI) 1850**], no role for bronch in the acute post MI setting.
   FEN: Able to take pills, speech and swallow eval today, otherwise will
   need NGT. Maintenance IVF with boluses for volume. Replete lytes prn.
   ACCESS: LIJ removed, RIJ placed [**2-13**],
   PROPHYLAXIS:  Hep SC, bowel regimen, PPI IV, switch to PO when
   tolerating.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man with limited past medical history who presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient initially required dopamine and dobutamine due to hypotension but experienced an episode of hypotension and bradycardia during which a code was called. The patient continues to have small pressor requirements and is uncertain whether cardiogenic shock is the cause or if there are other potential etiologies.

The patient has been intubated and extubated successfully, tolerating a facemask and weaning down on oxygen. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia (ASP PNA) due to the presence of a cavitary lesion on the right upper lobe (RUL) of the lung, which pre-dates his respiratory distress. Empirically, the patient was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

The patient's coronary arteries show total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and bare-metal stent (BMS) placement. The patient remains dependent on dopamine and dobutamine post-catheterization and still requires persistent pressor support. Inferior hypokinesis is noted on the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

The patient's altered mental status/neuro deficits include poor orientation and inability to fully communicate. The patient's limbs are flaccid, and"

   # Hypotension
 Pt s/p inferior STEMI, initially hypotensive requiring
   dopamine/dobutamine. Switched to levo.  Turned off yesterday am, pt
   extubated, later on became bradycardic and hypotensive. Was on levophed
   with labile BPs, now back on dopamine, and IVF for hypotensive.  Ddx
   for this new episode:  Less likely primarily cardiac as no evidence of
   ECG changes, increase in CEs, possibly in setting of vagal episode or
   aspiration.  Also on ddx is primary neurologic process, acute stroke,
   metastatic disease or anoxic brain injury.
   - Dopamine prn and IVF boluses for BP, needs new a-line today.
   - F/u cx, covering broadly with vanc/zosyn for asp pna, needs ID
   approval today, planned 8 day course.  Started evening of [**2-15**].
   - CT followed by MRI to eval above neuro issues, ? neuro c/s.

   - Extubated successfully on [**2166-2-15**].
   - ABG here shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis which had
   initially resolved but has returned now that he is extubated.
   - CXR consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL cavitary lesion
   which pre-dates his respiratory distress
   - Sputum Cx during intubation growing oropharyngeal flora consistent
   with aspiration PNA
   - Given above concerns for aspiration, started empirically on

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited medical history who presented from outside with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He was initially hypotensive, requiring dopamine/dobutamine, then switched to levo. The patient was extubated but later became bradycardic and hypotensive, so he is now back on dopamine and IV fluids for hypotension. The differential diagnosis for his new episode includes primarily cardiac issues, but there are no ECG changes or increase in cardiac enzymes, suggesting a possible vagal episode or aspiration. Other possible causes include primary neurological processes, acute stroke, metastatic disease, or anoxic brain injury. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is planned for an 8-day course, with ID approval today.

The patient also has respiratory failure, intubated during a code at outside hospital, with no known history of lung disease but consistent with COPD and clubbing on examination. The etiology of his respiratory failure is unclear, with a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis that initially resolved but has returned now that he is extubated. The patient has a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe of the lung, which predates his respiratory distress, and sputum cultures during intubation are growing oropharyngeal flora consistent with aspiration pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a full code status. The patient has been on dopamine infusion at 7/hr due to hemodynamic instability, but an attempt to wean it off resulted in a significant drop in heart rate. The patient's neurological exam showed some movement in the right upper extremity (RUE) and left upper extremity (LUE), but minimal movement in the lower extremities (LE). The patient tolerated oral intake and was able to take PO Plavix. The patient's vital signs were relatively stable with a blood pressure in the 130s/80s, heart rate in the 70s, respiratory rate in the 30s, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's CVP was low at 3 mmHg, and fluid balance showed an intake of 2,650 mL with an output of 1,390 mL. The patient's blood gases showed a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 26, and HCO3 of 21. The patient's labs showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 13.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 32.0%, and elevated troponin-T level at 0.35 ng/mL. The patient's electrolytes were within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level (K+). The patient's cardiac enzymes were elevated with a"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient experienced a vagal-like reaction with a drop in pulse and blood pressure. The reaction was managed with an increase in dopamine and did not require chest compressions.
2. The patient's sputum grew Acinetobacter baumannii, which is sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient was placed on contact precautions.
3. The patient was evaluated by an electrophysiologist (EP) regarding repeated vagal events. It was decided to hold off on a pacemaker for now.
4. A neurologist consulted about the patient's neurologic condition, specifically the development of flaccidity. The neurologist believed that the differential diagnosis includes watershed infarcts in the spine or brain and recommended an MRI of the brain and spine. However, the patient is not considered stable for an MRI at this time, so the recommendation will be readdressed actively.
5. The patient failed a [Last Name] stim test. As a result, the patient was started on hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6hrs per CORTICUS study. The hydrocortisone treatment will be continued for 5 days and then tapered starting on the evening of [2166-2-22].

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   # Hypotension
 Pt s/p inferior STEMI, initially hypotensive requiring
   dopamine/Dobutamine current on dopamine only. Had episode of
   hypotension/bradycardia [**2-15**] during which code was called, repeat
   bradycardia with code blue on [**2166-2-17**] appeared to be in setting of
   either vagal episode or aspiration PNA.  Episode of [**2166-2-17**] was in the
   setting of dropping NG tube down. Initially thought to be fluid
   responsive.  Unclear if persistently hypotensive due to cardiogenic
   shock (unlikely given TTE) vs other potential etiologies.  Differential
   diagnosis includes adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, or
   acute bleed. Patient with crit drop this morning in the setting of
   arterial line and repeat intubation, no obvious source of bleeding.  ?
   if some central process is playing a role.  In terms of evaluation for
   adrenal insufficiency initial random cortisol 21 which is normal,
   however in ICU patient on pressors and intubated would expect value to
   be higher so may represent relative adrenal insufficiency. TSH 0.87
   which is WNL.
   - Dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP<60.
   - F/u cx, covering broadly with vanc/zosyn for asp pna, planned 8 day
   course.  Started evening of [**2-15**]
 covers both blood culture as well as
   - CT without acute process.  Consider MRI and neurology consult
   - Goal CVP 8-10
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test this morning with no appropriate response. Started on
   steroids per CORTICUS trial. Will receive hydrocortisone 50mg IVq6hrs
   for 5 days from [**2166-2-18**] to [**2166-2-22**] and then taper dose.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] be complicated by ongoing moderate upper GI bleeding (see below)
   # Respiratory failure
 initially intubated in setting of code at OSH.
   No known h/o lung disease but CXR consistent with COPD and has clubbing
   on exam.  Likely aspiration during code on [**2-15**], on antibiotics.
   Patient was increasingly tachypneic after code yesterday and acidotic,
   requiring reintubation last evening.  The etiology of his respiratory
   failure is likely multifactorial. He is hypoventilating secondary his
   COPD and rib Fx from compressions.  Also a component of aspiration PNA.
   There does not seem to be a diffusion defect as he has oxygenated well
   throughout this hospitalization.
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - CXR  from [**2-15**] consistent with aspiration PNA with ongoing RUL
   cavitary lesion which pre-dates his respiratory distress.  Given above
   concerns for aspiration, started empirically on vanc+pip/tazo on the
   evening of [**2166-2-15**]
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   - Sputum Cx grew Acinetobacter baumannii sensitive to pip/tazo. Will
   continue with above ABx. Placed on contact precautions
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: On the afternoon of [**2166-2-18**] Pt was found to have
   frank blood in his gastric aspirate for residuals after tube feeds. He
   was Hemodynamically unchanged at the time and HCT was stable.
   - Received additional boldus of Protonix 40mg IV and started on a
   Protonix drip
   - GI aware of Pt and following closely. Will hold off on EGD for now
   given labile BP and pulse and since Pt is stable
   - Received additional unit of pRBC
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Type and screen up today
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - Consider restarting tube feeds today
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   Dopamine/dobutamine dependent post cath.  Has mild inferior hypokinesis
   on TTE.  Still with persistent pressor requirement.  Pt is I/O even
   since midnight.  Was initially fluid responsive.  Seems to be less so
   now, although not very positive last 24 hours.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -ASA, plavix
   -high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24. This metabolic
   picture is consistent with poor nutrition and generally poor metabolic
   state
   - HbA1C 5.7
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation and not fully communicative.  Toxic-metabolic workup
   thus far negative.  Also had ongoing flaccid limbs and depressed
   reflexes. Distribution with b/l LE and LUE?RUE is not anatomic in terms
   of an identifiable neurologic lesion.  More likely a more diffuse
   process, possibly ICU myopathy.  Now with recurrent autonomic
   instability with multiple vagal episodes leading to code blue.
   -aggressive nutritional support
   -Check B12, folate, RPR, TSH (B12, folate TSH normal at OSH), wnl here
   -thiamine repletion
   -Consider MRI to further evaluate
   - Neuro consult recommended brain and spinal MRI. Will consider doing
   this today if Pt can tolerate the procedure and staffing is available
   to monitor the Pt at MRI
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal om TTE yesterday.
   No elevated filling pressures on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   -no BB, ACEI while on pressors
   # RHYTHM: had episode of bradycardia [**2-15**] resulting in code blue.  Did
   not appear to be a primary cardiac process.  ECG with various p-wave
   morphologies, potentially in setting of respiratory compromise.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   -w/u of respiratory issues as above.
   # Lung mass
 Has RUL cavitary lesion on CT as well as lesion in
   liver.  Concerning for TB vs. malignancy, no known TB risk factors.
   Pulmonary not planning to bronch during this admission.
   - ruling out for TB, [**3-11**] sputums negative.
   - ppd placed on [**2-13**] (L forearm), read as negative
   - IP [**Name (NI) 1850**], no role for bronch in the acute post MI setting.
   FEN:patient had OG tube placed yesterday, confirm positioning with
   chest x-ray then initiate tube feeds. Replete lytes prn.
   ACCESS: LIJ removed, RIJ placed [**2-13**], arterial line placed [**2-17**]
   PROPHYLAXIS:  Hep SC, bowel regimen, PPI IV, switch to PO when
   tolerating.
   CODE: Full, discussed with family

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited known medical history who presented from the operating room (OSH) with an inferior STEMI, subsequently undergoing RCA revascularization. The patient experienced hypotension and bradycardia on two separate occasions, leading to code blues. The initial hypotension/bradycardia episode occurred during the code on 2-15 and the second episode happened during the arterial line placement on 2-17. Both episodes were associated with asphyxiation events. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring dopamine support and IV fluid boluses for MAP < 60. The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, necessitating reintubation due to tachypnea and acidosis. The chest x-ray revealed findings consistent with COPD and clubbing. The sputum culture grew Acinetobacter baumannii sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, prompting the initiation of contact precautions.

The patient also experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleed, with frank blood observed in gastric aspirates. Protonix was administered IV and started as a drip, along with the transfusion of additional packed red blood cells. The patient's coronary status is complicated by ongoing moderate upper GI bleeding, which is being closely monitored by the GI team.

Neurological deficits, including poor orientation, altered mental status, and flaccid limbs with depressed reflexes, have been present since extubation. A neurology"

   episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in hypotension, so
   may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin stimulation
   test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited known medical problems who presented to the emergency department with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient experienced hypotension that responded to dopamine and norepinephrine, suggesting cardiogenic shock initially. However, it was later determined to be multifactorial due to hypovolemia, bleeding, and autonomic dysfunction.

The patient also had profound vagal episodes with pauses resulting in hypotension, which may indicate some autonomic dysfunction. Additionally, the patient had an abnormal cosyntropin stimulation test, suggesting adrenal insufficiency.

In terms of respiratory failure, the patient had impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics due to recent chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease. Fluid overload is less likely given the absence of significant edema on x-rays.

The patient was treated with antibiotics for staph in blood culture and acinetobacter in sputum. The goal CVP was set at 8-10, and empiric corticosteroids were continued. Treatment for GI bleeding was provided as needed.

For coronary artery disease, the patient had a total occlusion of RCA and underwent BMS placement. Beta-blockers were held temporarily until off pressors. ASA and Plavix were continued, along with high-dose statin therapy.

Regarding altered mental status/neuro deficits, the patient had poor"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Overall status a little better.  Now on hydrocortisone after failed
   stimulatioin study. GI bleeding without hemodynamic changes or major
   drop in HCT.
   Appreciate neuro and GI recommendations.
   Physical Examination
   Unchanged.
   Medical Decision Making
   Major goals for today:
   Wean off dopamine; Continue antibiotic coverage for acinetobacter
   pneumonia; MR to exclude stroke as cause for neurologic abnormalities
   as noted (left arm and bilateral leg weakness, flaccidity);
   Continue ventilator until neurologic and respiratory status stable.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Critical care: Hemodynamic instability; Ventilator management.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited known medical problems who presented from outside with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and subsequently underwent right coronary artery (RCA) revascularization. The patient experienced several complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, altered mental status/neuro deficits, and recurrent vagal episodes.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial hypotension was thought to be cardiogenic due to an inferior MI. There is a possibility of cardiogenic shock developing if the heart function further deteriorates.

2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, which is a multi-drug resistant organism. Proper infection control measures need to be continued to prevent the spread of infection.

3. GI bleeding: Although the patient is currently stable, there is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current condition. Close monitoring and appropriate management of the GI bleeding is necessary.

4. Neurological deficits: The patient has altered mental status and neurologic deficits, which may be due to a stroke or other neurological causes. Further evaluation, including an MRI, is recommended to determine the underlying cause and guide treatment.

5. Autonomic dysfunction: The patient has experienced recurrent vagal episodes leading to hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Also possible hypovolemia, since volume responsive at times.  There was
   concern for bleeding given falling hematocrit and transiently improved
   pressor requirement after transfusions.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes
   - Dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP<60,wean as
   tolerated
   - d/c Vancomycin yesterday as staph epidermis in blood culture only
   from one bottle and likely contaminant
   - changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] (from Zosyn)  for pansensitive
   acinetobacter in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**], would complete 8 day course
   - Goal CVP 8-10, fluid bolus to maintain
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days
   - Treat GI bleeding as needed, crit has been stable
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease.
   Fluid overload less likely given absence of significant edema on
   x-rays.  Patient becoming more alkalotic on vent, primarily
   respiratory, will decrease PS to 12 today.
   - Treat pneumonia, plan for 8-day course of Unasyn for acinetobacter.
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: Gastroccult positive OG tube contents, perhaps
   related to insertion trauma however may be independent bleed. Currently
   stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD given Hct stable and no
   further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, changed PPi to [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for Hct <
   25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds will increase free water flushes
   - pm Hct today
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -ASA, plavix
   -high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24.
   - HbA1C 5.7
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped from 366 -> [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday which is greater than 50% drop.  Time course is consistent
   with possible HIT.  Heparin products d/c
d yesterday and HIT Ab sent.
   DIC labs negative.  PPI can cause thrombocytopenia, however favor
   continuing given recent GIB.  Held off starting argatroban given risk
   of bleeding and no evidence of thrombotic events at this time.
   - Holding heparin products
   - f/u HIT Ab
   - Start argatroban if develops thrombosis or HIT positive
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue.
   - Appreciate neurology input, Plan for MRI brain and spine today
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   -thiamine repletion, aggressive nutritional support
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling
   pressures not elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   -no BB, ACEI while on pressors
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out.  Per pulmonary, warrants outpatient
   evaluation after stabilization of acute issues.
   FEN: OG tube, restart tube feeding today. Inc. free water flushes for
   hypernatremia.  Replete lytes prn.

There are concerns about thrombocytopenia, possibly due to HIT, and altered mental status/neuro deficits with poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed reflexes. The patient's pump function is normal despite initial concerns for RV dysfunction. The rhythm is primarily bradycardia, possibly due to vagal episodes. Lung mass is being evaluated for tuberculosis. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications for his conditions, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and corticosteroids."

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   # Hypotension
 Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be cardiogenic
   [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.  Also possible
   hypovolemia, since volume responsive at times.  There was concern for
   bleeding given falling hematocrit and transiently improved pressor
   requirement after transfusions.  Lastly, having several prolonged vagal
   episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in hypotension, so
   may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin stimulation
   test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes
   - Dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP<60,wean as
   tolerated
   - Vancomycin for staph in blood culture, Zosyn for acinetobacter in
   sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**]
   - Goal CVP 8-10
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids
   - Treat GI bleeding as needed
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease.
   Fluid overload less likely given absence of significant oedema on
   x-rays.
   - Treat pneumonia, plan for 8-day course of Zosyn for acinetobacter.
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: Gastroccult positive OG tube contents, perhaps
   related to insertion trauma. Currently stable
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, PPI gtt, and transfuse for Hct < 30 or
   drop  more than 5 points
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - Consider restarting tube feeds today
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -ASA, plavix
   -high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24.
   - HbA1C 5.7
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue.
   - Appreciate neurology input, Plan for MRI brain and spine today
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   -thiamine repletion, aggressive nutritional support
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling
   pressures not elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   -no BB, ACEI while on pressors
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out.  Per pulmonary, warrants outpatient
   evaluation after stabilization of acute issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient experienced hypotension initially thought to be cardiogenic but later found to be multifactorial, possibly due to hypovolemia, bleeding, autonomic dysfunction, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is currently on dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP <60, weaning as tolerated. 

The patient also has respiratory failure due to impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics from recent chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease. Treatment includes weaning vent as tolerated, treating pneumonia, and monitoring for fluid overload.

Additionally, the patient has an upper GI bleeding that is stable and being monitored with serial hematocrits, PPI gtt, and transfusion for Hct <30 or drop of more than 5 points. The patient's coronary arteries show total occlusion of RCA with stent placement. 

The patient has altered mental status/neuro deficits with ongoing poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed reflexes. Toxic-metabolic workup is negative, and the patient awaits neurology input and MRI brain and spine.

Other findings include concern for RV dysfunction, normal RV function on TTE and right heart cath, EF 45-50%, low CVP, and lung mass suspected to be"

The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited medical history who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He has been experiencing hypotension, respiratory failure, upper GI bleeding, altered mental status, and neuro deficits. The patient's condition is multifactorial, with potential causes including cardiogenic shock, hypovolemia, autonomic dysfunction, and adrenal insufficiency. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to cardiogenic shock, hypovolemia, autonomic dysfunction, or adrenal insufficiency. The plan includes dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP < 60, weaning as tolerated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's impaired gas exchange is attributed to aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics from recent chest compressions, and possible underlying obstructive lung disease. Treatment includes antibiotics for pneumonia, weaning off the ventilator as tolerated, and monitoring for fluid overload.
3. Upper GI bleeding: The bleeding could be related to insertion trauma of the OG tube. The plan involves monitoring serial hematocrits, administering PPI gtt, and transfusing for Hct < 30 or a drop of more than 5 points.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has been stable most of the day but experienced bradycardia when trying to wean off dopamine. The patient's platelet count has been trending down since admission, raising the possibility of HIT (Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). All heparin products have been discontinued, and a HIT antibody test has been sent. Due to the high bleeding risk, Argatroban has been held off. The patient has also been switched to a high-dose PPI (proton pump inhibitor) and fungal markers have been sent.

The patient is receiving several infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, dopamine, and was previously receiving heparin sodium prophylaxis. The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned earlier. The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other parameters. The patient's temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as a low platelet count. The blood work also indicates elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer. The electrolyte levels, such as potassium, sodium"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Also possible hypovolemia, since volume responsive at times.  There was
   concern for bleeding given falling hematocrit and transiently improved
   pressor requirement after transfusions.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes
   - Dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP<60,wean as
   tolerated
   - d/c Vancomycin yesterday as staph epidermis in blood culture only
   from one bottle and likely contaminant
   - changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] (from Zosyn)  for pansensitive
   acinetobacter in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**], would complete 8 day course
   - Goal CVP 8-10, fluid bolus to maintain
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids
   - Treat GI bleeding as needed, crit has been stable
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease.
   Fluid overload less likely given absence of significant edema on
   x-rays.
   - Treat pneumonia, plan for 8-day course of Unasyn for acinetobacter.
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: Gastroccult positive OG tube contents, perhaps
   related to insertion trauma however may be independent bleed. Currently
   stable
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, changed PPi to [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for Hct <
   25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds will increase free water flushes
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -ASA, plavix
   -high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24.
   - HbA1C 5.7
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue.
   - Appreciate neurology input, Plan for MRI brain and spine today
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   -thiamine repletion, aggressive nutritional support
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling
   pressures not elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   -no BB, ACEI while on pressors
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out.  Per pulmonary, warrants outpatient
   evaluation after stabilization of acute issues.
   FEN: OG tube, start tube feeding after MRI today. Replete lytes prn.
   ACCESS: LIJ removed, RIJ placed [**2-13**], arterial line placed [**2-17**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited past medical history who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He has been in the ICU since admission and has developed several medical complications. These include hypotension, respiratory failure, upper GI bleeding, coronary artery disease, altered mental status/neuro deficits, and rhythm disturbances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, requiring the use of vasopressors such as dopamine and norepinephrine. There are multiple factors contributing to his hypotension, including cardiogenic shock from the inferior STEMI, hypovolemia, and autonomic dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to impaired gas exchange caused by aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics from recent chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease. He has been treated for pneumonia with a planned 8-day course of Unasyn for acinetobacter.

3. Upper GI Bleeding: The patient had a positive Gastrocult test indicating bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. It is unclear if the bleeding is related to trauma from the OG tube insertion or an independent source. He is currently stable, and his hematocrit levels are being monitored. Prophylactic measures include continued use of PPI, transfusion for Hct < 25 or drop of more than 5"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization
   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Also possible hypovolemia, since volume responsive at times.  There was
   concern for bleeding given falling hematocrit and transiently improved
   pressor requirement after transfusions.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes
   - Dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP<60,wean as
   tolerated
   - d/c Vancomycin yesterday as staph epidermis in blood culture only
   from one bottle and likely contaminant
   - changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] (from Zosyn)  for pansensitive
   acinetobacter in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**], would complete 8 day course
   - Goal CVP 8-10, fluid bolus to maintain
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days
   - Treat GI bleeding as needed, crit has been stable
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease.
   Fluid overload less likely given absence of significant edema on
   x-rays.  Patient becoming more alkalotic on vent, primarily
   respiratory, will decrease PS to 12 today.
   - Treat pneumonia, plan for 8-day course of Unasyn for acinetobacter.
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: Gastroccult positive OG tube contents, perhaps
   related to insertion trauma however may be independent bleed. Currently
   stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD given Hct stable and no
   further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, changed PPi to [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for Hct <
   25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds will increase free water flushes
   - pm Hct today
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB for now until off pressors
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -ASA, plavix
   -high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24.
   - HbA1C 5.7
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped from 366 -> [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday which is greater than 50% drop.  Time course is consistent
   with possible HIT.  Heparin products d/c
d yesterday and HIT Ab sent.
   DIC labs negative.  PPI can cause thrombocytopenia, however favor
   continuing given recent GIB.  Held off starting argatroban given risk
   of bleeding and no evidence of thrombotic events at this time.
   - Holding heparin products
   - f/u HIT Ab
   - Start argatroban if develops thrombosis or HIT positive
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue.
   - Appreciate neurology input, Plan for MRI brain and spine today
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   -thiamine repletion, aggressive nutritional support
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling
   pressures not elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP.
   -no BB, ACEI while on pressors
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out.  Per pulmonary, warrants outpatient
   evaluation after stabilization of acute issues.
   FEN: OG tube, restart tube feeding today. Inc. free water flushes for
   hypernatremia.  Replete lytes prn.
   ACCESS: LIJ removed, RIJ placed [**2-13**], arterial line placed [**2-17**]
   PROPHYLAXIS:  pneumoboots, bowel regimen, PPI IV

","The patient is a 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented to the emergency department with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has multiple medical complications.

1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive and required pressor support. The cause of hypotension is multifactorial, including cardiogenic shock due to inferior MI, hypovolemia, potential bleeding, and autonomic dysfunction. The patient also has an abnormal cosyntropin stimulation test suggesting adrenal insufficiency.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has impaired gas exchange due to aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics from recent chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease. There is no evidence of fluid overload on x-rays. The patient's condition is becoming more alkalotic on the ventilator, primarily respiratory, so the pressure support level will be decreased to 12 today.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has evidence of UGIB, which may be related to OG tube insertion trauma or an independent bleed. The patient's hematocrit is stable, and no further bleeding has been noted. Monitoring of serial hematocrits is recommended, and the patient should be transfused for a hematocrit less than 25 or a drop of more than 5 points. The patient will continue to have IV access x2 and keep a type & screen up to date"

   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes
   - Dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP<60,wean as
   tolerated
   - d/c Vancomycin yesterday as staph epidermis in blood culture only
   from one bottle and likely contaminant
   - changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] (from Zosyn)  for pansensitive
   acinetobacter in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**], would complete 8 day course
   - Goal CVP 8-10, fluid bolus to maintain
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 25
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, possibly underlying obstructive lung disease, and
   now bloody secretions.  Fluid overload less likely given absence of
   significant edema on x-rays.
   - Appreciate pulmonary recommendations, will obtain CTA chest for PE
   - Treat pneumonia, plan for 8-day course of Unasyn for acinetobacter.
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   .
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: Gastroccult positive OG tube contents, perhaps
   related to insertion trauma however may be independent bleed. Currently
   stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD given Hct stable and no
   further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, changed PPi to [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for Hct <
   25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds will increase free water flushes
   - pm Hct today
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -off all pressors
   -ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24, HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped from 366 -> [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday which is greater than 50% drop.  Time course is consistent
   with possible HIT.  Heparin products d/c
d yesterday and HIT Ab sent.
   DIC labs negative.  PPI can cause thrombocytopenia, however favor
   continuing given recent GIB.  Held off starting argatroban given risk
   of bleeding and no evidence of thrombotic events at this time. HIT
   antibody negative.
   - Appreciate Hematology recommendations
   - Holding heparin products
   - Start argatroban if develops thrombosis
   - Transfuse platelets <10 or critical bleeding
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue. MRI brain without obvious lesions,
   MRI c-spine with spinal stenosis.
   - f/u neurology recs
   - soft cervical collar
   - f/u final read of MRI, consider additional work-up as per neurology
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here

   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling
   pressures not elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP and CVP goal [**8-18**]
   -no BB, ACEI in the setting of recent hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Neurologic exam explained by critical cervical spine stenosis.
   Unlikely contribution to current picture but a risk for recovery
   prognosis and rehab.
   Thrombocytopenia a concern for HIT. Appreciate hematology input. Agree
   not to start DTI unless thrombotic complication.
   Monitor carefully for bleeding

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with limited known past medical history who presented to the hospital with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequently underwent right coronary artery (RCA) revascularization. The patient experienced hypotension, which was initially thought to be cardiogenic due to the inferior MI but later responded to dopamine and norepinephrine. It was also determined that some of the hypotension could be attributed to blood loss caused by thrombocytopenia and prolonged vagal episodes resulting in pauses and hypotension.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics due to recent chest compressions, possibly underlying obstructive lung disease, and now bloody secretions. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Additionally, the patient has an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which was identified through a positive Gastrocult test of the oral gastric (OG) tube contents. This bleeding may be related to insertion trauma or an independent bleed. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and no further bleeding has been observed.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a significant drop in platelet count since admission. This is consistent with possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin products have been discontinued, and HIT antibodies are pending. The"

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial and initially thought to be cardiogenic due to an inferior MI. However, it responded to dopamine/norepinephrine, suggesting possible hypovolemia as well. The patient also had transiently improved pressor requirement after transfusions and experienced prolonged vagal episodes with pauses resulting in hypotension. An abnormal cosyntropin stimulation test suggests a component of adrenal insufficiency.

Plan:
- Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes.
- Dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP<60, wean as tolerated.
- Discontinue Vancomycin due to suspected contaminant.
- Change to Unasyn for pansensitive acinetobacter in sputum.
- Goal CVP 8-10, fluid bolus to maintain.
- Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days.
- Treat GI bleeding as needed, crit has been stable.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics due to recent chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease. Fluid overload is less"

   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Also possible hypovolemia, since volume responsive at times.  There was
   concern for bleeding given falling hematocrit and transiently improved
   pressor requirement after transfusions.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes
   - Dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP<60,wean as
   tolerated
   - d/c Vancomycin yesterday as staph epidermis in blood culture only
   from one bottle and likely contaminant
   - changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] (from Zosyn)  for pansensitive
   acinetobacter in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**], would complete 8 day course
   - Goal CVP 8-10, fluid bolus to maintain
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days
   - Treat GI bleeding as needed, crit has been stable
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, and possibly underlying obstructive lung disease.
   Fluid overload less likely given absence of significant edema on
   x-rays.  Patient becoming more alkalotic on vent, primarily
   respiratory, will decrease PS to 12 today.
   - Treat pneumonia, plan for 8-day course of Unasyn for acinetobacter.
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   .
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: Gastroccult positive OG tube contents, perhaps
   related to insertion trauma however may be independent bleed. Currently
   stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD given Hct stable and no
   further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, changed PPi to [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for Hct <
   25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds will increase free water flushes
   - pm Hct today
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -off all pressors
   -ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24, HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped from 366 -> [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday which is greater than 50% drop.  Time course is consistent
   with possible HIT.  Heparin products d/c
d yesterday and HIT Ab sent.
   DIC labs negative.  PPI can cause thrombocytopenia, however favor
   continuing given recent GIB.  Held off starting argatroban given risk
   of bleeding and no evidence of thrombotic events at this time. HIT
   antibody negative.
   - Holding heparin products
   - Start argatroban if develops thrombosis
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue. MRI brain without obvious lesions,
   MRI c-spine with spinal stenosis. Lyme serology now positive, most
   likely this represents chronic previous infection. No CSF obtained to
   evaluate for neurologic lyme.
   - f/u neurology recs, consider spine consult
   - soft cervical collar
   - f/u final read of MRI, consider additional work-up as per neurology
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, CVP is low and RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling
   pressures not elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%
   - Bolus IV fluid as above for BP and CVP goal [**8-18**]
   -no BB, ACEI in the setting of recent hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry monitoring
   .
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out.  Per pulmonary, warrants outpatient
   evaluation after stabilization of acute issues.
   .
   FEN: OG tube, tube feeds. free water flushes for hypernatremia.
   Replete lytes prn.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited medical history who presented from the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization.
2. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is likely multifactorial. It initially responded to dopamine and norepinephrine but later improved with volume responsiveness and autonomic dysfunction.
3. The patient also has signs of profound vagal episodes with pauses resulting in hypotension.
4. A Cosyntropin stimulation test was abnormal, suggesting adrenal insufficiency.
5. The patient is being treated with dopamine for pressure support and IVF boluses for MAP < 60, to be weaned as tolerated.
6. Vancomycin was discontinued due to a likely contaminant in the blood culture, and the patient is now on Unasyn for pansensitive acinetobacter in sputum.
7. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics from recent chest compressions, and possible underlying obstructive lung disease.
8. The patient is being treated for pneumonia with an 8-day course of Unasyn and will have daily trials of breathing while on the ventilator.
9. The patient has an upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is currently stable. It may be related to insertion trauma or an independent bleed.
10. The patient has a history of inferior myocardial infarction with total occlusion of the RCA and has undergone BMS placement.
11. The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly since admission, which is consistent with possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin products have been discontinued, and HIT antibodies are negative.
12. The patient has altered mental status/neuro deficits, including poor orientation, flaccid limbs, and depressed reflexes. An MRI brain and c-spine have been performed, but there are no obvious lesions. Lyme serology is positive, most likely representing a chronic previous infection.
13. The patient's pump function appears normal on TTE, with an ejection fraction of 45-50%.
14. The patient has experienced repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
15. A lung mass has been identified, and tuberculosis is being ruled out.
16. The patient is receiving prophylaxis for pneumoboots, bowel regimen, and PPI IV.
17. The patient's current disposition is to remain in the CCU for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued hypotension and autonomic dysfunction.
2. Development of further respiratory failure or complications related to the lung mass.
3. Recurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Progression of neurologic deficits or development of new neurological issues.
5. Thrombocytopenia or further complications related to possible HIT.
6. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or worsening pump function.
7. Infection or sepsis due to immunocompromised state or indwelling lines.
8. Further evaluation and management of the identified lung mass.
9. Potential complications related to long-term ventilation and sedation.
10. Monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances and glycemic control.

 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited medical problems who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI. He underwent RCA revascularization and was initially thought to have cardiogenic hypotension due to the inferior MI. However, it was later determined that the hypotension was likely multifactorial, involving blood loss due to thrombocytopenia, autonomic dysfunction, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is currently receiving dopamine for pressure support and IV fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 60, with plans to wean as tolerated.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. It is believed to be caused by impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics following recent chest compressions, possible underlying obstructive lung disease, and now bloody secretions. The treatment plan includes obtaining a CTA chest for pulmonary embolism (PE), treating pneumonia with an 8-day course of Unasyn for Acinetobacter, and weaning the ventilator as tolerated with daily trials of breathing.

The patient has an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which is currently stable. A gastrocult test was positive for OG tube contents, and the bleed may be related to insertion trauma or independent. Monitoring of serial hematocrits is planned, along with changing PPI to Hospital1, transfusing for hematocrit below 25 or a drop of"

   meningitis. Neuro rec LP when possible
   - Given lymes serology and concern for cardiac and CNS lymes added CTX
   2gIV daily
   - Switched to cipro for Acinetobacter as Unasyn can cause
   thrombocytopenia
   - Received 1 U pRBC and had appropriate bump in Hb from 9.1 to 10.1
   - Pt underwent CTA this afternoon which showed no PE, parabronchial
   cavitary lesion concerning for sqamous ca, lytic lesion of T6, and
   parahilar and periarotic LAD as well as large bilat pulm effusions

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited medical history who presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He continues to be intubated with multiple complications including thrombocytopenia, difficult-to-control blood pressures, bradycardia, and paresis. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial and initially thought to be cardiogenic due to an inferior MI, but responded to dopamine/norepinephrine. Other factors contributing to hypotension include blood loss due to thrombocytopenia and autonomic dysfunction, as evidenced by abnormal cosyntropin stimulation test suggesting adrenal insufficiency. 

The patient also has respiratory failure with impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics, possible underlying obstructive lung disease, and bloody secretions. There is no evidence of fluid overload. Treatment includes ciprofloxacin for pneumonia, daily sputum for cytology, and bronchoscopy with BAL sent for cytology and culture due to concern for lung cancer. 

Thrombocytopenia is present with a significant drop in platelet count since admission, which is consistent with possible HIT. Heparin products have been discontinued, and HIT Ab sent. DIC labs are negative, and proton pump inhibitors can cause thrombocytopenia but have been discontinued due to recent gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is stable, with positive Gastrocult OG"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization. Continues to be intubated with multiple
   complications including thrombocytopenia, difficult to control BPs,
   bradycardia, and paresis.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes
   - Now off dopamine for pressure support.
   - Goal CVP 8-10. Stable now. Holding off on additional IVF boluses as
   very volume overloaded and UOP acceptable at about 30mL/hr
   - d/ced vancomycin as Staph epidermis in blood culture only from one
   bottle and likely contaminant
   - Changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] from Zosyn  for pansensitive acinetobacter
   in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**]
   - Changed again to cipro on [**2166-2-21**] as Pt developed thrombocytopenia
   which could be [**2-10**] Unasyn.
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days. Begin steroid taper
   overnight 2/14-15/09
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 25
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, possibly underlying obstructive lung disease, and
   now bloody secretions.  Fluid overload less likely given absence of
   significant edema on x-rays.  Desated this morning, FiO2 increased to
   100%.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2, maintain sats >92%
   - Appreciate pulmonary recommendations, CTA chest negative for PE
   - Treat pneumonia as above with cipro
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   - Per pulmonary will do daily sputum for cytology
   - Bronchoscopy [**2166-2-21**] showed some blood and extensive mucous plugging.
   BAL sent for cytology and culture. Concern for lung ca
   - CT-A [**2166-2-21**] showed no PE but large cavitary mass extending into
   bronchus concerning for squamous ca with possible met to T6 as well as
   hilar and carinal LAD
   - Consider diuresis if unable to wean vent and BP remains stable given
   b/l pleural effusions
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped precipitously
   from 366 -> 9 yesterday.  There was initial concern for  HIT.  Heparin

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Multiple complicated medical issues:
   1. Respiratory failure with worsening oxygenation - increased pleural
   effusions, bleeding, ? mucus plugging and R sided lung mass.
    Plan to optimize sedation, gentle diuresis (even though not volume
   overloaded by filling pressure, in the setting of low albumin and
   possible adverse renal handling of sodium and water, diuresis may
   improve urine output and decrease transudation of fluid into tissues.
   2. Thrombocytopenia. Agree most likely immune related and very unlikely
   HIT or destructive process. Steroids increased and holding potential
   offending agents as much as possible.
   3. Cord compression. Malignancy versus trauma/degenerative disease.
   4. Lung mass most definitely malignancy with probable metastasis to T6
   by CT.
   Have asked to discuss again with family that prognosis for recovery is
   poor and verify treatment goals.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Ventilator, hemodynamics

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with limited medical history who presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He is currently intubated and experiencing multiple complications including thrombocytopenia, difficult-to-control blood pressure, bradycardia, and paresis. The patient has also been diagnosed with pneumonia, a lung mass concerning for squamous cell carcinoma with possible metastasis to T6, and severe C5 spinal stenosis from osteophytes versus carcinomatous meningitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including impaired gas exchange due to aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics from recent chest compressions, underlying obstructive lung disease, and bloody secretions. The plan is to optimize sedation, attempt to wean FiO2, maintain saturation >92%, and perform daily sputum cytology.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly from 366 to 9. Initial concern for HIT was ruled out, and DIC labs were negative. The possible offending agents, including protonic, Unasyn, and heparin, have been discontinued. Steroids have been increased, and the patient is being monitored for further bleeding.

3. Upper GI Bleeding: The patient has a gastrocult positive OG tube content, which may be related to insertion trauma or an independent bleed."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had EEG today per neuro. Results pending
   - MRI showed severe C5 stenosis from osteophyte v carcinomatous
   meningitis. Neuro rec LP when possible
   - Given lymes serology and concern for cardiac and CNS lymes added CTX
   2gIV daily
   - Switched to cipro for Acinetobacter as Unasyn can cause
   thrombocytopenia
   - Received 1 U pRBC and had appropriate bump in Hb from 9.1 to 10.1
   - Pt underwent CTA this afternoon which showed no PE, parabronchial
   cavitary lesion concerning for sqamous ca, lytic lesion of T6, and
   parahilar and periarotic LAD as well as large bilat pulm effusions
   - Pt underwent bronchoscopy. Samples were sent for Cx and cytology
   - Plan for daily sputum for cytology
   - PLTs dropped to 9 in the PM. Transfused 2U pooled PLT and increased
   steriods from 50mg to 100mg hydrocort IV q6hrs. PLT holding at 15-18
   - Spine [**Doctor First Name **] rec rigid collar for spinal stenosis. However, we held off
   as this was pushing on central line and increasing bleeding in the
   context of thrombocytopenia
   - Temp dropped to 91 PO. Added bearhugger
   - Spoke to son [**Name (NI) 322**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] was told Mr. [**Known lastname 4078**] may die tonight and

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization. Continues to be intubated with multiple
   complications including thrombocytopenia, difficult to control BPs,
   bradycardia, and paresis.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes
   - Now off dopamine for pressure support.
   - Goal CVP 8-10. Stable now. Holding off on additional IVF boluses as
   very volume overloaded and UOP acceptable at about 30mL/hr
   - d/ced vancomycin as Staph epidermis in blood culture only from one
   bottle and likely contaminant
   - Changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] from Zosyn  for pansensitive acinetobacter
   in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**]
   - Changed again to cipro on [**2166-2-21**] as Pt developed thrombocytopenia
   which could be [**2-10**] Unasyn.
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days. Begin steroid taper
   overnight 2/14-15/09
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 25
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, possibly underlying obstructive lung disease, and
   now bloody secretions.  Fluid overload less likely given absence of
   significant edema on x-rays.  Desated this morning, FiO2 increased to
   100%.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2, maintain sats >92%
   - Appreciate pulmonary recommendations, CTA chest negative for PE
   - Treat pneumonia as above with cipro
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   - Per pulmonary will do daily sputum for cytology
   - Bronchoscopy [**2166-2-21**] showed some blood and extensive mucous plugging.
   BAL sent for cytology and culture. Concern for lung ca
   - CT-A [**2166-2-21**] showed no PE but large cavitary mass extending into
   bronchus concerning for squamous ca with possible met to T6 as well as
   hilar and carinal LAD
   - Consider diuresis if unable to wean vent and BP remains stable given
   b/l pleural effusions
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped precipitously
   from 366 -> 9 yesterday.  There was initial concern for  HIT.  Heparin
   products d/c
d HIT Ab sent and negative.  DIC labs negative.  PPI also
   d/c
d as well as unasyn given risk of thrombocytopenia. Held off
   starting argatroban given risk of bleeding and no evidence of
   thrombotic events at this time. Heme following, appreciate their recs.
   Hydrocort inc. for ? ITP.
   - Appreciate Hematology recommendations
   - Holding heparin products
   - Transfuse platelets <10 or critical bleeding
   - Discontinued possible offending drugs including protonic (now on
   sucralfate), unasyn (now on cipro), heparin.
   .
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: Gastroccult positive OG tube contents, perhaps
   related to insertion trauma however may be independent bleed. Currently
   stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD given Hct stable and no
   further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, changed PPi to [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for Hct <
   25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds
   - pm Hct
   - Attempt to keep PLT > 10
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -off all pressors
   -ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24, HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue. MRI brain without obvious lesions,
   MRI c-spine with spinal stenosis.
   - f/u neurology recs
   - Nsurg rec hard collar but was pressing on central line and causing
   bleeding given thrombocytopenia. Will hold off on hard collar for the
   moment
   - MRI with severe spinal stenosis at C5 [**2-10**] osteophytes v carcinomatous
   meningitis. Brain WNL
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   - Neuro recommends LP, however given severe thrombocytopenia will hold
   off.
   - f/u spine recs
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling pressures not
   elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%.  CVP now in normal
   range.
   - 20L positive this admission. CVP holding now. Will hold off on
   additional fluids and titrate to UOP > 30mL/hr
   -no BB, ACEI in the setting of recent hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of limited known pre-existing medical history. The patient presented to the emergency department with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He is currently intubated and has multiple complications including thrombocytopenia, difficult-to-control blood pressures, bradycardia, and paresis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently unstable, and there are several factors contributing to this, such as cardiogenic shock due to the inferior MI, blood loss due to thrombocytopenia, and autonomic dysfunction. Adrenal insufficiency has also been suggested by an abnormal cosyntropin stimulation test.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing impaired gas exchange due to aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics from recent chest compressions, possible underlying obstructive lung disease, and bloody secretions. The patient's FiO2 has been increased to 100%, and efforts will be made to wean FiO2 while maintaining sats above 92%. A CT-A has shown no evidence of PE but revealed a large cavitary mass extending into the bronchus concerning for squamous cell carcinoma with possible metastasis to T6 as well as hilar and carinal LAD.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped precipit"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization. Continues to be intubated with multiple
   complications including thrombocytopenia, labile BPs, bradycardia, and
   paresis.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Neurology and EP initially following for vagal episodes, not felt to
   be pacing candidate
   - Now off dopamine for pressure support.
   - Goal CVP 8-10. Stable now. Holding off on additional IVF boluses as
   very volume overloaded
   - d/ced vancomycin as Staph epidermis in blood culture only from one
   bottle and likely contaminant
   - Changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] from Zosyn  for pansensitive acinetobacter
   in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**]
   - Changed again to cipro on [**2166-2-21**] as Pt developed thrombocytopenia
   which could be [**2-10**] Unasyn, completes cipro today
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days, however also on steroids
   for thrombocytopenia so will continue.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 25
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, possibly underlying obstructive lung disease, and
   now bloody secretions.  Fluid overload less likely given absence of
   significant edema on x-rays.  Desated this morning, FiO2 increased to
   100%.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2, maintain sats >92%
   - Appreciate pulmonary recommendations, CTA chest negative for PE
   - Treat pneumonia as above with cipro, completes course today
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   - Per pulmonary will do daily sputum for cytology
   - Bronchoscopy [**2166-2-21**] showed some blood and extensive mucous plugging.
   BAL sent for cytology and culture. Concern for lung ca
   - CT-A [**2166-2-21**] showed no PE but large cavitary mass extending into
   bronchus concerning for squamous ca with possible met to T6 as well as
   hilar and carinal LAD
   - Continue diuresis given b/l pleural effusions
   - Discuss possible trach if unable to wean from vent
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped precipitously
   from 366 -> 9.  There was initial concern for  HIT.  Heparin products
   d/c
d HIT Ab sent and negative.  DIC labs negative.  PPI also d/c
d as
   well as unasyn given risk of thrombocytopenia. Held off starting
   argatroban given risk of bleeding and no evidence of thrombotic events
   at this time. Heme following, appreciate their recs.  Hydrocort inc.
   for ? ITP.
   - Appreciate Hematology recommendations
   - Holding heparin products
   - Transfuse platelets <10 or critical bleeding
   - Discontinued possible offending drugs including protonix (now on
   sucralfate), unasyn (now on cipro), heparin.
   .
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: Gastroccult positive OG tube contents, perhaps
   related to insertion trauma however may be independent bleed. Currently
   stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD given Hct stable and no
   further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, changed PPi to [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for Hct <
   25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds
   - pm Hct
   - Attempt to keep PLT > 10
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -off all pressors
   -ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24, HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue. MRI brain without obvious lesions,
   MRI c-spine with spinal stenosis.
   - f/u neurology recs
   - Nsurg rec hard collar but was pressing on central line and causing
   bleeding given thrombocytopenia. Will hold off on hard collar for the
   moment
   - MRI with severe spinal stenosis at C5 [**2-10**] osteophytes v carcinomatous
   meningitis. Brain WNL
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   - Neuro recommends LP, however given severe thrombocytopenia will hold
   off.
   - f/u spine recs
   - Cont soft collar
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling pressures not
   elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%.  CVP now in normal
   range.
   - 20L positive this admission. CVP holding now. Will hold off on
   additional fluids and titrate to UOP > 30mL/hr
   -no BB, ACEI in the setting of recent hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry monitoring
   .
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out, fungal studies pending.  Appreciate
   pulmonary evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited medical history, who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He is currently intubated and has multiple complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status/neuro deficits, and a lung mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, with episodes of hypotension. This may be due to cardiogenic shock secondary to the inferior MI, blood loss due to thrombocytopenia, or autonomic dysfunction. An abnormal cosyntropin stimulation test suggests adrenal insufficiency as a contributing factor.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics, possible underlying obstructive lung disease, and bloody secretions. There is also a concern for pneumonia and lung cancer.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly since admission. Initial concern for HIT was ruled out with negative HIT antibodies. DIC labs were also negative. Possible offending drugs such as heparin, protonix, and Unasyn were discontinued. Hydrocortisone was initiated for possible ITP.
4. Altered Mental Status/Neuro Deficits: The patient has poor orientation, difficulty with communication, flaccid limbs, and depressed reflexes. Toxic-met"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization. Continues to be intubated with multiple
   complications including thrombocytopenia, difficult to control BPs,
   bradycardia, and paresis.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Appreciate Neurology and EP input regarding profound vagal episodes
   - Now off dopamine for pressure support.
   - Goal CVP 8-10. Stable now. Holding off on additional IVF boluses as
   very volume overloaded and UOP acceptable at about 30mL/hr
   - d/ced vancomycin as Staph epidermis in blood culture only from one
   bottle and likely contaminant
   - Changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] from Zosyn  for pansensitive acinetobacter
   in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**]
   - Changed again to cipro on [**2166-2-21**] as Pt developed thrombocytopenia
   which could be [**2-10**] Unasyn.
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days. Begin steroid taper
   overnight 2/14-15/09
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 25
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, possibly underlying obstructive lung disease, and
   now bloody secretions.  Fluid overload less likely given absence of
   significant edema on x-rays.  Desated this morning, FiO2 increased to
   100%.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2, maintain sats >92%
   - Appreciate pulmonary recommendations, CTA chest negative for PE
   - Treat pneumonia as above with cipro
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   - Per pulmonary will do daily sputum for cytology
   - Bronchoscopy [**2166-2-21**] showed some blood and extensive mucous plugging.
   BAL sent for cytology and culture. Concern for lung ca
   - CT-A [**2166-2-21**] showed no PE but large cavitary mass extending into
   bronchus concerning for squamous ca with possible met to T6 as well as
   hilar and carinal LAD
   - Consider diuresis if unable to wean vent and BP remains stable given
   b/l pleural effusions
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped precipitously
   from 366 -> 9 yesterday.  There was initial concern for  HIT.  Heparin
   products d/c
d HIT Ab sent and negative.  DIC labs negative.  PPI also
   d/c
d as well as unasyn given risk of thrombocytopenia. Held off
   starting argatroban given risk of bleeding and no evidence of
   thrombotic events at this time. Heme following, appreciate their recs.
   Hydrocort inc. for ? ITP.
   - Appreciate Hematology recommendations
   - Holding heparin products
   - Transfuse platelets <10 or critical bleeding
   - Discontinued possible offending drugs including protonic (now on
   sucralfate), unasyn (now on cipro), heparin.
   .
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING: Gastroccult positive OG tube contents, perhaps
   related to insertion trauma however may be independent bleed. Currently
   stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD given Hct stable and no
   further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, changed PPi to [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for Hct <
   25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds
   - pm Hct
   - Attempt to keep PLT > 10
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -off all pressors
   -ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24, HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue. MRI brain without obvious lesions,
   MRI c-spine with spinal stenosis.
   - f/u neurology recs
   - Nsurg rec hard collar but was pressing on central line and causing
   bleeding given thrombocytopenia. Will hold off on hard collar for the
   moment
   - MRI with severe spinal stenosis at C5 [**2-10**] osteophytes v carcinomatous
   meningitis. Brain WNL
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   - Neuro recommends LP, however given severe thrombocytopenia will hold
   off.
   - f/u spine recs
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling pressures not
   elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%.  CVP now in normal
   range.
   - 20L positive this admission. CVP holding now. Will hold off on
   additional fluids and titrate to UOP > 30mL/hr
   -no BB, ACEI in the setting of recent hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry monitoring
   - Repeat EKG this am
   .
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out, fungal studies pending.  Appreciate
   pulmonary evaluation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is likely multifactorial in origin. It may be due to cardiogenic shock from the inferior STEMI, blood loss due to thrombocytopenia, or autonomic dysfunction.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which is multifactorial as well. It may be caused by impaired gas exchange from aspiration or lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics due to recent chest compressions, underlying obstructive lung disease, and bloody secretions.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a significant drop in platelet count from 366 to 9. There was initial concern for HIT, but further testing ruled out this condition. DIC labs were also negative. Possible causes of thrombocytopenia include PPI, Unasyn, and heparin.

4. Upper GI bleeding: The patient has evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by a positive gastrocult test on OG tube contents. This may be related to insertion trauma or an independent bleed.

5. Coronary artery disease: The patient had an inferior STEMI with total occlusion of the RCA and subsequent BMS placement. There are ongoing concerns regarding coronary artery disease management.

6. Altered mental status/neuro deficits: The patient has poor orientation, flaccid limbs, and depressed"

   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Has made some progress with improved respiratory status and more stable
   hemodynamics.
   Will begin ventilator weaning efforts; Attempt diuresis today for
   mobilization of 3rd space volume.
   Completing course of antibiotics for pneumonia;
   Neuro status unchanged.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health
   care proxy.
   Additional comments:
   Detailed discussion with sons yesterday. They understand and have
   expressed wishes to continue full efforts including CPR if needed.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2166-2-23**] 11:23 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with limited medical history who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient continues to have multiple complications including thrombocytopenia, labile blood pressures, bradycardia, and paresis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is likely multifactorial. It has responded to dopamine/norepinephrine and may be due to blood loss, autonomic dysfunction, or adrenal insufficiency.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics, underlying obstructive lung disease, and bloody secretions. The patient's FiO2 has been increased to 100% and will attempt to wean FiO2 while maintaining sats >92%. Daily trials of breathing will be done, and a tracheostomy may be considered if unable to wean from the ventilator.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly since admission, which initially raised concerns for HIT. Heparin products were discontinued, and other potential offending drugs were also stopped. The patient will be monitored for further bleeding, and platelet transfusion will be given if the platelet count is <10 or in case of critical bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited medical history who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI and subsequently underwent RCA revascularization. He is currently intubated and experiencing multiple complications, including hypotension, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status/neuro deficits, and a lung mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is multifactorial and includes cardiogenic shock from inferior MI, blood loss due to thrombocytopenia, vagal episodes leading to hypotension, and possible autonomic dysfunction. The patient's blood pressure has responded to dopamine/norepinephrine, and efforts are being made to maintain a goal CVP of 8-10.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial as well, caused by impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics due to recent chest compressions, possible underlying obstructive lung disease, and bloody secretions. The patient is being weaned off FiO2 and ventilator support as tolerated.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly since admission, initially raising concerns for HIT. Heparin products were discontinued, and the patient has tested negative for HIT antibodies. Other potential causes of thrombocytopenia, such as DIC and PPI, have also been ruled out."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of recent myocardial infarction (heart attack).
- The patient's platelet count is low, indicating thrombocytopenia.
- The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hemodynamic instability.
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin.
- The patient's vital signs show bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), and decreased oxygen saturation.
- The patient's respiratory status is being supported by mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- The patient's fluid balance shows an ongoing loss of fluids through various routes.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of troponin T, CK-MB, and LDH, suggesting ongoing myocardial injury and hemolysis.
- The patient's nutrition status is concerning due to impaired physical mobility and altered nutrition.
- The patient has a pulmonary nodule that requires further evaluation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Thromboembolic events: The patient's low platelet count and immobilization due to mechanical ventilation increase the risk of thromboembolic events"

   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several

   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited medical background who was admitted to the ICU for inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient continues to experience multiple complications including thrombocytopenia, labile blood pressures, bradycardia, and paresis.

The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, initially thought to be cardiogenic due to an inferior MI, but responded to dopamine/norepinephrine. It is also attributed to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia and autonomic dysfunction. The patient has an abnormal cosyntropin stimulation test, suggesting a component of adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial as well, caused by impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics following recent chest compressions, underlying obstructive lung disease, and bloody secretions. A bronchoscopy showed blood and extensive mucous plugging. BAL sent for cytology and culture. The patient has a large cavitary mass extending into the bronchus concerning for squamous cancer with possible metastasis to T6, as well as hilar and carinal lymphadenopathy. The patient is desaturated this morning, with FiO2 increased to 100%.

The patient has thrombocytopenia with platelet counts dropping precipitously from 366 to 9. There was initial concern for HIT, but it is now"

   Chief Complaint: rca infarct
   24 Hour Events:
   - heme/onc follow up stated think low probability that HIT given degree
   of thrombocytopenia, ask to check daily hemolysis labs including LDH,
   haptoglobin, bili, retic count
   - consider 1 mg/kg/daily of prednisone instead of hydrocortisone to see
   if plts respond (have to weigh risk with infection), [**Hospital1 **] platelets
   - PICC consult placed, will be unable to try today, put in for
   survellience cxrs for hopefully PICC tomorrow (will need plts prior to
   PICC for goal plts > 30)
   - PM crit stable at 26, platelets improve to 15
   - no new spine recs
   - PICC nurse came by, apparently thinks that will need IR guided PICC
   placed for access, did not place any peripheral IVs
   - got 20 IV lasix x2 put out to it each time, CVP dropped afterwards to
   [**2-12**].

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Worsening hypoxia on pressure support. Unlikely to have successful
   wean. Will continue diuresis. To complete course of treatment for
   acinetobacter pneumonia today. Platelet count remains dramatically low
   without [**Last Name (un) 4133**] bleeding.  No platelet transfusion today.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of limited medical background who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI. He underwent RCA revascularization and continues to be intubated due to multiple complications including thrombocytopenia, labile blood pressures, bradycardia, and paresis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension initially thought to be cardiogenic due to an inferior MI, but it responded to dopamine/norepinephrine. It is likely multifactorial, with blood loss due to thrombocytopenia and autonomic dysfunction contributing factors. An abnormal cosyntropin stimulation test suggests a component of adrenal insufficiency.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure due to impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent chest compressions, underlying obstructive lung disease, and now bloody secretions. A bronchoscopy showed blood and extensive mucous plugging, and a CT angiogram showed a large cavitary mass extending into the bronchus concerning for squamous cell carcinoma with possible metastasis to T6 as well as hilar and carinal lymphadenopathy. The patient is currently on 100% FiO2 and attempts will be made to wean FiO2 while maintaining sats >92%. 

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

   Chief Complaint: rca infarct
   24 Hour Events:
   - heme/onc follow up stated think low probability that HIT given degree
   of thrombocytopenia, ask to check daily hemolysis labs including LDH,
   haptoglobin, bili, retic count
   - consider 1 mg/kg/daily of prednisone instead of hydrocortisone to see
   if plts respond (have to weigh risk with infection), [**Hospital1 **] platelets
   - PICC consult placed, will be unable to try today, put in for
   survellience cxrs for hopefully PICC tomorrow (will need plts prior to
   PICC for goal plts > 30)
   - PM crit stable at 26, platelets improve to 15
   - no new spine recs
   - PICC nurse came by, apparently thinks that will need IR guided PICC

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization. Continues to be intubated with multiple
   complications including thrombocytopenia, labile BPs, bradycardia, and
   paresis.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was
   abnormal suggesting component of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Neurology and EP initially following for vagal episodes, not felt to
   be pacing candidate
   - Now off dopamine for pressure support.
   - Goal CVP 8-10. Stable now. Holding off on additional IVF boluses as
   very volume overloaded
   - d/ced vancomycin as Staph epidermis in blood culture only from one
   bottle and likely contaminant
   - Changed to Unasyn [**2166-2-19**] from Zosyn  for pansensitive acinetobacter
   in sputum, day 1=[**2166-2-15**]
   - Changed again to cipro on [**2166-2-21**] as Pt developed thrombocytopenia
   which could be [**2-10**] Unasyn, completes cipro today
   - Continue empiric corticosteroids x 5 days, however also on steroids
   for thrombocytopenia so will continue.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 25
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, possibly underlying obstructive lung disease, and
   now bloody secretions.  Fluid overload less likely given absence of
   significant edema on x-rays.  Desated this morning, FiO2 increased to
   100%.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2, maintain sats >92%
   - Appreciate pulmonary recommendations, CTA chest negative for PE
   - Treat pneumonia as above with cipro, completes course today
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - f/u AFB neg. x3, now off precautions.
   - Per pulmonary will do daily sputum for cytology
   - Bronchoscopy [**2166-2-21**] showed some blood and extensive mucous plugging.
   BAL sent for cytology and culture. Concern for lung ca
   - CT-A [**2166-2-21**] showed no PE but large cavitary mass extending into
   bronchus concerning for squamous ca with possible met to T6 as well as
   hilar and carinal LAD
   - Continue diuresis given b/l pleural effusions
   - Discuss possible trach if unable to wean from vent
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped precipitously
   from 366 -> 9.  There was initial concern for  HIT although suspect
   less likely given severity of thrombocytopenia.  Heparin products d/c
   HIT Ab sent and negativex1.  DIC labs negative.  PPI also d/c
d as well
   as unasyn given risk of thrombocytopenia. Held off starting argatroban
   given risk of bleeding and no evidence of thrombotic events at this
   time. Heme following, appreciate their reccomendation.  Patient on
   hydrocortisone for possible ITP. Yesterday heme recommending possibly
   switching to prednisone from hydrocort to see if there is any
   improvement in platelet count, held off in the setting of possible
   infection and will discuss this AM.
   - f/u heme recs
   - Holding heparin products
   - Transfuse platelets <10 or critical bleeding, will also need to
   transfuse prior to procedures
   - Discontinued possible offending drugs including protonix (now on
   sucralfate), unasyn (now on cipro), heparin.
   .
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING
 now resolved: Gastroccult positive OG tube
   contents, perhaps related to insertion trauma however may be
   independent bleed. Currently stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD
   given Hct stable and no further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, Hct < 25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - holding PPi in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia as above
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds
   - Attempt to keep PLT > 10
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
   -Bolus prn for BP and UOP.
   -off all pressors
   -ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24, HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue. MRI brain without obvious lesions,
   MRI c-spine with spinal stenosis.
   - f/u neurology recs
   - Nsurg rec hard collar but was pressing on central line and causing
   bleeding given thrombocytopenia. Will hold off on hard collar for the
   moment
   - MRI with severe spinal stenosis at C5 [**2-10**] osteophytes v carcinomatous
   meningitis. Brain WNL
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   - Neuro recommends LP, however given severe thrombocytopenia will hold
   off.
   - spine recommended follow up for possible surgical intervention if
   patient mental stasis improves, no new recs left yesterday
   - Cont soft collar
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling pressures not
   elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%.  CVP now in normal
   range.
   - 20L positive this admission. CVP holding now. Will hold off on
   additional fluids and titrate to UOP > 30mL/hr
   -no BB, ACEI in the setting of recent hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry monitoring
   .
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out, fungal studies pending most likely etiology
   is malignant especially given lytic lesions seen on CT.  Pulmonary
   following.
   - CT-A ready [**2166-2-21**] concerning for squamous lung ca with mets to T5
   and LNs
   - cytology is not pending on [**Last Name (LF) 4122**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to discuss with pulmonary
   that definitely sent sample for eval from bronchoscopy

   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization. Continues to be intubated with multiple
   complications including thrombocytopenia, labile BPs, bradycardia, and
   paresis.
   .
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Remains tachypneic with respiratory alkalosis.
   Desatted but able to be weaned back down to FiO2 of 50%. CT was neg for
   PE. Appreciate pulmonary input. Possibly related to underlying pulm
   process, such as suspected malignancy.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2, maintain sats >92%
   - Appreciate pulmonary recommendations, CTA chest negative for PE
   - Completed Abx course for PNA
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - Continue diuresis given b/l pleural effusions, start lasix gtt with
   excellent diuresis
   - Goal I/O -1L
   - Discuss trach with pulmonary and family given unable to wean from
   vent
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped precipitously
   from 366 -> 9.  There was initial concern for  HIT although suspect
   less likely given severity of thrombocytopenia.  Heparin products d/c
   HIT Ab sent and negativex1 with a repeat pending.  DIC labs negative.
   PPI also d/c
d as well as unasyn given risk of thrombocytopenia. Held
   off starting argatroban given risk of bleeding and no evidence of
   thrombotic events at this time. Heme following, appreciate their
   recommendation.  Patient initially on hydrocortisone for possible ITP.
   Heme recommended switching to prednisone or equivalent
   - Swithed to solumedrol 80mg IV daily with stabilization of PLTs
   - f/u heme recs
   - Holding heparin products
   - Transfuse platelets <10 or critical bleeding, will also need to
   transfuse prior to procedures
   - Discontinued possible offending drugs including protonix (now on
   sucralfate), unasyn (now on cipro), heparin.
   - Resending HIT (anti PF4 antibodies) per heme
   .
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING
 now resolved: Gastroccult positive OG tube
   contents, perhaps related to insertion trauma however may be
   independent bleed. Currently stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD
   given Hct stable and no further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, Hct < 25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - holding PPI in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia as above
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds
   - Attempt to keep PLT > 10
   - Continue sucralfate
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
   -Holding additional boluses as 20L+
   -off all pressors, can restart PRN
   -Continue ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24, HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # AMS / CANAL STENOSIS: Overall, picture is concerning for anatomic
   spinal lesion, appreciate neurology following. After extubation Pt had
   ongoing poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs,
   depressed reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue. MRI brain without obvious lesions,
   MRI c-spine with spinal stenosis.
   -  Urgent Head Scan this am to assess for ICH.
   - Nsurg rec hard collar but was pressing on central line and causing
   bleeding given thrombocytopenia. Will hold off on hard collar for the
   moment
   - MRI with severe spinal stenosis at C5 [**2-10**] osteophytes v carcinomatous
   meningitis. Brain WNL
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   - Neuro recommends LP, however given severe thrombocytopenia will hold
   off.
   - spine recommended follow up for possible surgical intervention if
   patient mental stasis improves, no new recs left yesterday
   - Cont hard collar
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling pressures not
   elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%.  CVP now in normal
   range.
   - 20L positive this admission. CVP holding now. Will hold off on
   additional fluids and titrate to UOP > 30mL/hr
   -no BB, ACEI in the setting of recent hypotension
   - lasix gtt ongoing with good diuresis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry monitoring
   .
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out, fungal studies pending most likely etiology
   is malignant especially given lytic lesions seen on CT.  Pulmonary
   following.
   - CT-A ready [**2166-2-21**] concerning for squamous lung ca with mets to T5
   and LNs
   - cytology preliminary read from BAL with atypical squamous cells
   concerning for malignancy
   - Continue daily sputum cytology for now until definitive diagnosis
   # Hypotension
 Improved. Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to
   be cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was abnormal in that rise was <9. suggesting component
   of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Neurology and EP initially following for vagal episodes, not felt to
   be pacing candidate
   - Now off dopamine for pressure support.
   - Goal CVP 8-10. Stable now. Holding off on additional IVF boluses as
   very volume overloaded
   - d/ced vancomycin as Staph epidermis in blood culture only from one
   bottle and likely contaminant
   - Completed abx for acinetobacter PNA
   - Continue stress-dose steroids, completed 5 days, however continued
   for thrombocytopenia.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 25
   .
   FEN: OG tube, tube feeds started, patient with decreased residuals,
   Replete lytes prn.
            Will increase free water boluses given Hypernatremia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with limited past medical history who presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. The patient continues to have multiple complications including respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, labile blood pressures, bradycardia, and paralysis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains tachypneic with respiratory alkalosis and desaturation. There is a concern for underlying pulmonary process such as suspected malignancy. The patient may require further respiratory support and weaning off the ventilator.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly from 366 to 9. There is concern for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), but further investigation is needed. DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) labs are negative, and the patient is currently on steroids for possible ITP (immune thrombocytopenia). Monitoring of platelet count and consideration of transfusion is recommended.

3. Upper GI Bleeding: The patient had an upper GI bleed, which is now resolved. There may be a need for endoscopy to evaluate the source of bleeding. Close monitoring of hematocrit and Hct levels is necessary.

4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had an inferior MI with total occlusion of the RCA and underwent BMS"

   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization. Continues to be intubated with multiple
   complications including thrombocytopenia, labile BPs, bradycardia, and
   paresis.
   .
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Remains tachypneic with respiratory alkalosis.
   Desatted but able to be weaned back down to FiO2 of 50%. CT was neg for
   PE. Appreciate pulmonary input. Possibly related to underlying pulm
   process, such as suspected malignancy.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2, maintain sats >92%
   - Appreciate pulmonary recommendations, CTA chest negative for PE
   - Completed Abx course for PNA
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - Continue diuresis given b/l pleural effusions, start lasix gtt with
   excellent diuresis
   - Goal I/O -1L
   - Discuss trach with pulmonary and family given unable to wean from
   vent
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped precipitously
   from 366 -> 9.  There was initial concern for  HIT although suspect
   less likely given severity of thrombocytopenia.  Heparin products d/c
   HIT Ab sent and negativex1 with a repeat pending.  DIC labs negative.
   PPI also d/c
d as well as unasyn given risk of thrombocytopenia. Held
   off starting argatroban given risk of bleeding and no evidence of
   thrombotic events at this time. Heme following, appreciate their
   recommendation.  Patient initially on hydrocortisone for possible ITP.
   Heme recommended switching to prednisone or equivalent
   - Swithed to solumedrol 80mg IV daily with stabilization of PLTs
   - f/u heme recs
   - Holding heparin products
   - Transfuse platelets <10 or critical bleeding, will also need to
   transfuse prior to procedures
   - Discontinued possible offending drugs including protonix (now on
   sucralfate), unasyn (now on cipro), heparin.
   - Resending HIT (anti PF4 antibodies) per heme
   .
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING
 now resolved: Gastroccult positive OG tube
   contents, perhaps related to insertion trauma however may be
   independent bleed. Currently stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD
   given Hct stable and no further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, Hct < 25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - holding PPI in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia as above
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds
   - Attempt to keep PLT > 10
   - Continue sucralfate
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
   -Holding additional boluses as 20L+
   -off all pressors, can restart PRN
   -Continue ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24, HbA1C 5.7
   .
   # AMS / CANAL STENOSIS: Overall, picture is concerning for anatomic
   spinal lesion, appreciate neurology following. After extubation Pt had
   ongoing poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs,
   depressed reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue. MRI brain without obvious lesions,
   MRI c-spine with spinal stenosis.
   -  Urgent Head Scan this am to assess for ICH.
   - Nsurg rec hard collar but was pressing on central line and causing
   bleeding given thrombocytopenia. Will hold off on hard collar for the
   moment
   - MRI with severe spinal stenosis at C5 [**2-10**] osteophytes v carcinomatous
   meningitis. Brain WNL
   - B12, folate, RPR, TSH, wnl here
   - Neuro recommends LP, however given severe thrombocytopenia will hold
   off.
   - spine recommended follow up for possible surgical intervention if
   patient mental stasis improves, no new recs left yesterday
   - Cont hard collar
   .
   # PUMP:  Initial concern for RV dysfunction given ischemic territory,
   however, RV function appeared normal on TTE and filling pressures not
   elevated on right heart cath. TTE shows EF 45-50%.  CVP now in normal
   range.
   - 20L positive this admission. CVP holding now. Will hold off on
   additional fluids and titrate to UOP > 30mL/hr
   -no BB, ACEI in the setting of recent hypotension
   - lasix gtt ongoing with good diuresis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Repeated vagal episodes resulting in loss of pulse.
   Appreciate EP and Neurology input regarding same.
   - Holding BB given hypotension, bradycardia.
   -telemetry monitoring
   .
   # Lung mass
 TB rule-out, fungal studies pending most likely etiology
   is malignant especially given lytic lesions seen on CT.  Pulmonary
   following.
   - CT-A ready [**2166-2-21**] concerning for squamous lung ca with mets to T5
   and LNs
   - cytology preliminary read from BAL with atypical squamous cells
   concerning for malignancy
   - Continue daily sputum cytology for now until definitive diagnosis
   # Hypotension
 Improved. Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to
   be cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was abnormal in that rise was <9. suggesting component
   of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Neurology and EP initially following for vagal episodes, not felt to
   be pacing candidate
   - Now off dopamine for pressure support.
   - Goal CVP 8-10. Stable now. Holding off on additional IVF boluses as
   very volume overloaded
   - d/ced vancomycin as Staph epidermis in blood culture only from one
   bottle and likely contaminant
   - Completed abx for acinetobacter PNA
   - Continue stress-dose steroids, completed 5 days, however continued
   for thrombocytopenia.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 25
   .
   FEN: OG tube, tube feeds started, patient with decreased residuals,
   Replete lytes prn.
            Will increase free water boluses given Hypernatremia.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains tachypneic with respiratory alkalosis and has difficulty weaning off the ventilator. This could indicate ongoing respiratory distress or underlying lung pathology such as suspected malignancy.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly from 366 to 9. This could be due to various causes including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Further evaluation and management are required to address this issue.

3. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding: The patient experienced an upper GI bleed, which has now resolved. However, there is a concern for potential recurrence, especially with the use of medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Monitoring of serial hematocrits and close observation for signs of bleeding are recommended.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient had an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) with total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). There is a need for ongoing management of this condition, including antiplatelet therapy and statins.

5. Autonomic instability and vagal episodes: The patient has experienced recurrent autonomic instability and vagal episodes, which can lead to bradycardia and even"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with limited known PMH presented from OSH with inferior STEMI, s/p
   RCA revascularization. Continues to be intubated with multiple
   complications including thrombocytopenia, labile BPs, bradycardia, and
   paresis.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Likely Multifactorial.  Initially thought to be
   cardiogenic [**2-10**] inferior MI, responded to dopamine/norepinephrine.
   Some due to blood loss due to thrombocytopenia.  Lastly, having several
   prolonged vagal episodes with vagal stimuli with pauses resulting in
   hypotension, so may have some autonomic dysfunction.  Also, Cosyntropin
   stimulation test was abnormal suggesting component of adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - Neurology and EP initially following for vagal episodes, not felt to
   be pacing candidate
   - Now off dopamine for pressure support.
   - Goal CVP 8-10. Stable now. Holding off on additional IVF boluses as
   very volume overloaded
   - d/ced vancomycin as Staph epidermis in blood culture only from one
   bottle and likely contaminant
   - Completed abx for acinetobacter PNA
   - Continue stress-dose steroids, completed 5 days, however continued
   for thrombocytopenia.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 25
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Multifactorial due to impaired gas exchange
   from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics given recent
   chest compressions, possibly underlying obstructive lung disease, and
   now bloody secretions.  Fluid overload less likely given absence of
   significant edema on x-rays. Bronchoscopy [**2166-2-21**] showed some blood and
   extensive mucous plugging. BAL sent for cytology and culture. Concern
   for lung ca.  CTA [**2166-2-21**] showed no PE but large cavitary mass
   extending into bronchus concerning for squamous ca with possible met to
   T6 as well as hilar and carinal LAD.  Desated this morning, FiO2
   increased to 100%.
   - Attempt to wean FiO2, maintain sats >92%
   - Appreciate pulmonary recommendations, CTA chest negative for PE
   - Completed Abx course for PNA
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily trials of breathing
   - Per pulmonary will do daily sputum for cytology
   - Continue diuresis given b/l pleural effusions, start lasix gtt with
   excellent diuresis
   - Goal I/O -1L
   - Discuss trach with pulmonary and family given unable to wean from
   vent
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt since admission have dropped precipitously
   from 366 -> 9.  There was initial concern for  HIT although suspect
   less likely given severity of thrombocytopenia.  Heparin products d/c
   HIT Ab sent and negativex1.  DIC labs negative.  PPI also d/c
d as well
   as unasyn given risk of thrombocytopenia. Held off starting argatroban
   given risk of bleeding and no evidence of thrombotic events at this
   time. Heme following, appreciate their reccomendation.  Patient
   initially on hydrocortisone for possible ITP. Heme recommended
   switching to prednisone or equivalent
   - Swithed to solumedrol 80mg IV daily with stabilization of PLTs
   - f/u heme recs
   - Holding heparin products
   - Transfuse platelets <10 or critical bleeding, will also need to
   transfuse prior to procedures
   - Discontinued possible offending drugs including protonix (now on
   sucralfate), unasyn (now on cipro), heparin.
   - Resending HIT (anti PF4 antibodies) per heme
   .
   # UPPER GI BLEEDING
 now resolved: Gastroccult positive OG tube
   contents, perhaps related to insertion trauma however may be
   independent bleed. Currently stable.  Evaluated by GI who deferred EGD
   given Hct stable and no further bleeding noted.
   - Monitor serial hematocrits, Hct < 25 or drop  more than 5 points
   - holding PPI in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia as above
   - Continue to have IV access x2
   - Keep type & screen up to date
   - Continue ASA and Plavix as needed to maintain stents
   - restarted tube feeds
   - Attempt to keep PLT > 10
   - Continue sucralfate
   .
   # CORONARIES:  s/p IMI, with total occlusion of RCA, s/p BMS.
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
   -Holding additional boluses as 20L+
   -off all pressors, can restart PRN
   -Continue ASA, Plavix, high dose statin
   -Lipid panel shows LDL below goal (39), HDL only 24, HbA1C 5.7

   # Altered Mental Status/neuro deficits: After extubation Pt had ongoing
   poor orientation, not fully communicative, flaccid limbs, depressed
   reflexes.  Distribution with b/l LE and LUE>RUE without clear
   suggestions of anatomic lesion.  Toxic-metabolic workup thus far
   negative.  Also with recurrent autonomic instability with multiple
   vagal episodes leading to code blue. MRI brain without obvious lesions,
   MRI c-spine with spinal stenosis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who was admitted with an inferior STEMI and underwent RCA revascularization. He is currently intubated and has multiple complications including thrombocytopenia, labile blood pressures, bradycardia, and paresis. The patient's condition is multifactorial and involves respiratory failure due to impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics, possible underlying obstructive lung disease, and bloody secretions. There is also concern for lung cancer with a large cavitary mass extending into the bronchus. The patient has hypotension, which may be multifactorial including cardiogenic causes, blood loss due to thrombocytopenia, and autonomic dysfunction. The patient also has altered mental status/neuro deficits with poor orientation and flaccid limbs, and a toxic-metabolic workup has been negative. There are recurrent autonomic instability with multiple vagal episodes leading to code blue, and an MRI brain showed no obvious lesions. The patient has a history of upper GI bleeding, coronary artery disease with total occlusion of RCA, and a stent placement. The patient's labs show atypical squamous cells concerning for malignancy from sputum cytology, and there is a concern for lung cancer with lytic lesions seen on CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to impaired gas exchange from aspiration/lung mass, impaired chest wall mechanics,"
