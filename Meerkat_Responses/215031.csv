","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleed, presented with acute renal failure and a hemoglobin level of 17.5 likely due to the lower GI bleed. She is moderately hypotensive from baseline with systolic pressures in the 80s-100s. The patient is oxygenating well on room air. She has had a recent fall with bruising on her back and may have lost some blood into hematomas. She also experienced nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. Grossly, she is extravascularly fluid overloaded with severe lower extremity edema.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia, although it could be multifactorial with beta-blockage in the setting of renal failure. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Pressors may be considered if MAP consistently remains below 60, and diuretics may be held for now.

2. GI Bleed: The patient likely has a GI bleed due to known telangiectasias seen on prior colonoscopy. She had negative gastric lavage and upper endoscopy in the past, so she will not be scoped tonight. Her hemoglobin level is significantly low at 17."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She presented today from an outpatient appointment with acute renal failure (ARF) and a hematocrit (Hct) level of 17.5, likely due to lower GI bleed. She is moderately hypotensive from baseline, with systolic blood pressures in the 80s-100s. Oxygenation is good on room air.

The patient has several medical complications:
1. Blood loss/anemia: Likely GI bleed with melena and Hct of 17.5, although her baseline is around 22. She also has a large left lower extremity (LLE) hematoma.
2. Hypotension: Likely due to hypovolemia, although could be multifactorial with beta-blocker usage in the setting of renal failure. The patient has had nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. She is grossly extravascularly fluid overloaded with severe lower extremity edema.
3. GI bleed: Likely due to known telangiectasias seen on prior colonoscopy. She had negative gastric lavage and negative upper endoscopy in [Month] 1088, so she will not be scoped tonight.

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleed. She presents today from an outpatient appointment with acute renal failure and a hematocrit of 17.5 likely due to the lower GI bleed. She is moderately hypotensive from baseline, with systolic blood pressures in the 80s-100s. Oxygenation is good on room air. 

Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She presents today from an outpatient appointment with acute renal failure (ARF) and a hematocrit (Hct) level of 17.5 likely due to the lower GI bleed. The patient is moderately hypotensive from baseline, with systolic blood pressures ranging from the 80s to 100s. She is oxygenating well on room air.

The patient has a history of severe diastolic CHF and requires aggressive diuretics. However, due to her hypotension, diuretics have been held. She also has a history of ulcerative colitis but does not seem to be in a flare. The patient recently experienced a fall, resulting in bruising on her back and a swollen and warm knee with a hematoma. This may have contributed to her anemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), a heart rate of 109 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 94/58 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. She is in atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Physical examination reveals generalized ed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe right-sided and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation (afib), and ulcerative colitis. The patient presented with acute renal failure (ARF) and anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) of 17.5. The patient also has melenotic, guiac positive stools indicating gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Anemia/Blood loss: The patient has a history of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and ulcerative colitis with recent hospitalization for lower GI bleeding. The presence of melenotic, guiac positive stools suggests ongoing GI bleeding. This could lead to further blood loss and worsening anemia.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is between 1.5-2.0, but it has increased to 2.8, indicating acute renal failure. The elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function, which may be due to pre-renal causes such as GI bleed or intrinsic renal damage.

3. Right-sided heart failure: The patient has a history of severe right-sided heart failure, and the recent echocardiogram shows markedly dilated right ventricle with mild global hypokinesis. This indicates compromised cardiac function, which can lead"

   fall. Plain films show no evidence of fracture and Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
   CT shows no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or other bleed.
   Baseline Hct 22. Hct stable at 23.1
   - Continue Q8h hematocrit checks

   - F/u serial lactates
   - Wean off pressors
   - Arterial line placed
   #) Diastolic, right-sided CHF with pulmonary hypertension. Echo report
   shows no major changes compared to prior studies. Elevated CVP likely
   owing to underlying severe right-heart failure. Patient is total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly dry.
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Consideration of diuretics during transfusion based on CVP readings
   and respiratory status.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider PA catheter
   #) Acute renal failure
acute on chronic with Creatinine of 2.4 although
   baseline is 1.5-2.0. FeNA is 0.1. Likely pre-renal in the setting of GI
   bleed, but urine was positive for eosinophils. Mesalamine known to
   cause long-term or acute on chronic interstitial nephritis is 1% of
   cases; if this is relevant to her, then the improvement in her renal
   function may also be due to withholding the drug in the setting of
   being NPO.
   - Continue to support volume status as above
   - Will touch base with renal and GI re: mesalamine
   - Goal urine output: 40cc's hour
   #) S/p Fall with R knee hematoma. Plain films without fracture. CT
   prelim read shows large hematoma.
   - Continue to monitor left knee
   - F/u final CT read
   - Social Work consulted; patient feels safe at home and reportedly
   husband has moved out.
   - Pain control: tylenol and lidocaine patch for now; avoid morphine
   when BP is tenuous.
   #) Ulcerative colitis
stable; no diarrhea or abdominal pain
   - Holding mesalamine for now, will check with GI and renal if okay to
   continue (?possible cause of AIN)
   - Per GI, while patient is not having bowel movements conduct serial
   abdominal exams and in indicated serial KUBs
   #) Atrial fibrillation: slow, ventricular response

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe right-sided and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), and ulcerative colitis.
- She presented with acute renal failure (ARF) and melenaotic, guiac positive stools.
- The patient has two sources of blood loss: lower gastrointestinal bleeding (multiple bleeding angioectasias noted on previous colonoscopy) or a hematoma from a fall.
- Her baseline hematocrit (Hct) is 22, and it has stabilized at 23.1.
- The patient's diastolic and right-sided CHF with pulmonary hypertension is ongoing, with an echo report showing no major changes compared to prior studies.
- She is volume overloaded but intravascularly dry, and consideration of a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter is being made.
- The patient has acute renal failure, acute on chronic, with a creatinine level of 2.4 (baseline is 1.5-2.0). FeNa is 0.1, indicating pre-renal azotemia due to GI bleed.
- However, urine was positive for eosinophils, suggesting possible interstitial nephritis caused by mesalamine, which the patient has been taking for ulcerative colitis.
- The patient also has a right knee hematoma from a fall, with plain films showing no fracture and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe right-sided and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), and ulcerative colitis. The patient presented with acute renal failure (ARF) and melena, which indicates gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Anemia/Blood loss: The patient has two potential sources of blood loss, lower GI bleeding due to multiple bleeding angioectasias and a hematoma from a fall. There are no fractures evident on plain films, and no retroperitoneal hematoma or other bleeding is seen on CT.
- Diastolic, right-sided CHF with pulmonary hypertension: The patient's echocardiogram shows no major changes compared to prior studies. Elevated central venous pressure (CVP) is likely due to underlying severe right-heart failure. The patient is volume overloaded but intravascularly dry.
- Acute renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.4 (baseline 1.5-2.0). FeNa is 0.1, indicating pre-renal azotemia. However, urine eosinophils are positive, suggesting an allergic interstitial nephritis, possibly related to mesalamine use.
- Fall with R knee hematoma: Plain films show no fracture, but a CT scan"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and ulcerative colitis. She presented with acute renal failure and melena, which indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. Imaging shows no evidence of fracture or retroperitoneal hematoma but does show extensive subcutaneous edema and bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/60 to 111/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She is alert and oriented, with an irregular rhythm and a systolic murmur at the right lower sternal border. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, and bowel sounds are present.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 161 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 23.1%, platelet count of 99 K/uL, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 32 mEq/L, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 3.4 mEq/L, chloride of 105 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 32 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL, calcium of 8.9 mg/dL, and phosphorus of 5.8 mg/dL.

Imaging reveals no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or fractures but does show extensive subcutaneous edema and bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's plan includes continuing hematocrit checks, weaning off pressors, monitoring respiratory status, starting spironolactone, and considering diuretics during transfusion based on central venous pressure readings and respiratory status. Acute renal failure is suspected, possibly due to pre-renal causes related to GI bleeding. The patient's urine was positive for eosinophils, suggesting interstitial nephritis as a potential cause. Mesalamine use may be relevant to her renal function, and its discontinuation is being considered."
