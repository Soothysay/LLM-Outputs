   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with apparent Trileptal toxicity resulting in hyponatremia and bradycardia. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. His condition is described as critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to severe neurological complications such as seizures, altered mental status, or even coma if not corrected promptly.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is abnormally slow, which may compromise cardiac output and result in hypoperfusion of vital organs. This can lead to symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, or even cardiac arrest if not addressed.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential dehydration or inadequate fluid resuscitation. This can contribute to hypotension and organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory support: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has normal oxygen saturation. However, the ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis, suggesting inadequate ventilation or respiratory muscle weakness. Close monitoring of respiratory status is essential.
5. Trileptal toxicity: The patient's symptoms of hyponatremia and bradycardia are likely due to Trileptal toxicity. Continued monitoring for any new symptoms or complications related to medication toxicity is necessary.
6. Infection risk: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and trigeminal neuralgia, who recently started taking oxcarbazapine (trileptal). The patient presented with unresponsiveness and was found to be resolving hyponatremia.

The patient's sodium levels have been consistently monitored, with readings of 118 at 10:30 pm, 121 at 3:30 am, and 121 this morning. The healthcare team discussed these values with the renal team.

The patient is currently on dopamine at a rate of 4.5 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/57 mmHg to 141/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, and normal heart sounds with bradycardia. The patient's extremities show absent pulses in both the right and left radial arteries. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count of 341 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 102/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on dopamine infusion at a rate of 4 mcg/kg/min.

The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia in the afternoon after attempting to wean off dopamine. Hyponatremia has plateaued, and hypertonic saline 3% at 25cc/hr was restarted.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted 24-hour events. The patient's recent laboratory results show low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient has multiple lines including an arterial line and multi-lumen central line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections due to being in the ICU and having multiple lines.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, which may indicate ongoing fluid loss or inadequate fluid"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and trigeminal neuralgia. He was recently started on oxcarbazapine (trileptal) and presented with unresponsiveness, resolving hyponatremia, and bradycardia.

The patient's sodium levels have plateaued, and hypertonic saline at 25cc/hr was restarted. He is currently on dopamine at 4 mcg/kg/min due to an episode of bradycardia into the 30s. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 77/49 mmHg to 102/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's physical examination revealed tiredness, an elderly male in no acute distress, supple neck, no jugular venous distention, bradycardia, no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds, clear lung fields, scrotal enlargement with an inguinal hernia, and normal neurologic examination with intact strength, sensation, and downgoing toes.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin levels ranging from 24.6% to 25.8%, platelet count of 306 thousand/mm3, creatinine levels ranging from 1.0 to 1.1 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 67 to 110 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range except for sodium which is 121 meq/L. Other lab values such as albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are also within normal range.

The patient's assessment includes hyponatremia secondary to trileptal, bradycardia possibly due to trileptal or hyponatremia, and new-onset diarrhea. The plan includes continuing fluid restriction, serial neurologic examinations, weaning dopamine as tolerated, sending a C. Diff test, and holding diuretics in the setting of hyponatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hyponatremia, further episodes of bradycardia, development of Clostridium difficile infection, and potential complications related to the patient's underlying conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus."

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old male with a PMH HTN and trigeminal neuralgia recently
   started on oxcarbazapine (trileptal), p/w unresponsiveness and found to
   be resolving hyponatremia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 Likely secondary to trileptal. Sodium 103 on
   admission, corrected to 121 over 24 hours, then plateaued. Hypertonic
   saline restarted overnight and Na came up to 123 this am.
   -- Renal following closely, appreciate recs
   -- Continue Fluid Restriction
   -- Restart 3% NaCl at 50cc/hr w/ q4 hr Na checks
   -- Serial Neuro-exams to assess for neurologic changes (CPM)
   .
   # Bradycardia: Cardiology suggests secondary to trileptal vs
   hyponatremia. However, there are not many cases of bradycardia
   assocated with either in the literature. Also possible that bradycardia
   was pre-existing and exacerbated by one of the above. Attempts were
   made to wean Dopamine drip yesterday and overnight, but pt had
   bradycardia trending into 30s and Dopamine was restarted.  Will hope
   that able to wean off of dopamine as pt becomes euvolemic and
   normo-natremic..
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated with MAP goals >65
   - If pt still Dopamine dependent once Na has normalized, consider
   cardiology consult
   - Check records to determine if bradycardia was pre-existing.
   .
   # Diarrhea: Pt continues to have loose, green, malodorous, stool
   without frank blood or melena. Has been C-diff negative x2.
   - Repeat C. Diff for 3^rd time
   - Consider sending broader stool studies w/ ova and parasites.
   # UCx positive for Group B strep: uncommon cause of UTI. Other
   possibilites would be an endocarditis that was seeding the urine and
   contributing to a bradycardia. However, pt has normal PR interval, and
   is responsive to dopamine, both of which would likely no be the cause
   in bradycardia [**2-20**] to endocarditis.
   - no need to treat currently, will follow clinically, resend UCx if
   develops symptoms

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and trigeminal neuralgia. He recently started taking oxcarbazapine (trileptal) and presented with unresponsiveness, which was later found to be resolving hyponatremia.

2. The patient's sodium level on admission was 103, which corrected to 121 over 24 hours. However, it then plateaued. Hypertonic saline was restarted, and the patient's sodium level increased to 123 this morning.

3. The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia with a heart rate in the 30s. This may be secondary to trileptal or hyponatremia, although there are limited cases of bradycardia associated with these conditions in literature. It is also possible that the bradycardia was pre-existing and exacerbated by one of the above factors.

4. The patient's dopamine drip was attempted to be weaned yesterday and overnight, but bradycardia occurred, so the dopamine was restarted. The plan is to wean dopamine as tolerated, with MAP goals >65. If the patient remains dopamine-dependent once sodium normalization occurs, a cardiology consult will be considered.

5. The patient continues to have loose, green, malodorous stool without frank blood or melena. He has been C"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient received hypertonic saline at 45cc/hour but it was stopped prior to completing 500cc due to an increase in sodium levels from 123 to 126, then to 129. The patient's sodium levels remained between 123 and 129. The IV fluid was changed to normal saline at 150 per hour x 1 liter. Dopamine was discontinued since 9 am and the patient's heart rate has been stable at around 60 beats per minute. Timolol eye drops were added. The patient's renal function remains unchanged, with continued hypertonic saline but normal saline should suffice. No known drug allergies exist. The patient received heparin sodium prophylaxis at 02:00 PM on [**2179-10-24**]. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 C (98.4 F), heart rate of 57 bpm with sinus bradycardia, blood pressure ranging from 112/59 to 141/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old male with a PMH HTN and trigeminal neuralgia recently
   started on oxcarbazapine (trileptal), p/w unresponsiveness and found to
   be resolving hyponatremia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 Likely secondary to trileptal. Sodium 103 on
   admission, corrected to 121 over 24 hours, then plateaued. Hypertonic
   saline restarted overnight and Na came up to 123 this am.
   -- Renal following closely, appreciate recs
   -- Continue Fluid Restriction
   -- Restart 3% NaCl at 50cc/hr w/ q4 hr Na checks
   -- Serial Neuro-exams to assess for neurologic changes (CPM)
   .
   # Bradycardia: Cardiology suggests secondary to trileptal vs
   hyponatremia. However, there are not many cases of bradycardia
   assocated with either in the literature. Also possible that bradycardia
   was pre-existing and exacerbated by one of the above. Attempts were
   made to wean Dopamine drip yesterday and overnight, but pt had
   bradycardia trending into 30s and Dopamine was restarted.  Will hope
   that able to wean off of dopamine as pt becomes euvolemic and
   normo-natremic..
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated with MAP goals >65
   - If pt still Dopamine dependent once Na has normalized, consider
   cardiology consult
   - Check records to determine if bradycardia was pre-existing.
   .
   # Diarrhea: Pt continues to have loose, green, malodorous, stool
   without frank blood or melena. Has been C-diff negative x2.
   - Repeat C. Diff for 3^rd time
   - Consider sending broader stool studies w/ ova and parasites.
   # UCx positive for Group B strep: uncommon cause of UTI. Other
   possibilites would be an endocarditis that was seeding the urine and
   contributing to a bradycardia. However, pt has normal PR interval, and
   is responsive to dopamine, both of which would likely no be the cause
   in bradycardia [**2-20**] to endocarditis.
   - no need to treat currently, will follow clinically, resend UCx if
   develops symptoms

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old man with apparent Trileptal toxicity resulting in
   hyponatremia and bradycardia.
   1. Hyponatremia : stable. No further 3%saline. Continue NS at 100 cc/hr
   and free water restrict
   2. Bradycardia : Appreciate EPs help.  Stable off dopamine. Monitor on
   telemetry
   3. Pain : off trileptal and without sig pain this AM- manage as needed
   with po Tylenol or low dose narcti if needed.
   4. Suspect low-concentration GBS in urine represents contaminant -
   repeat
   Other issues as per ICU team note
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: free water restrict

   Disposition :Transfer to floor
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with apparent Trileptal toxicity resulting in hyponatremia and bradycardia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/83 to 109/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is awake and alert, able to sit up in a chair, eat soup, and has clear output. Physical examination reveals no edema or neurologic deficits. Lab results show hyponatremia, low potassium, and normal glucose levels. The patient has been placed on free water restriction and is off dopamine, with plans for further management of hyponatremia and bradycardia. The patient's pain is being managed as needed, and there is suspicion of a contaminant in the urine sample. Other issues are noted in the ICU team's note. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding, and glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention and stress ulcer protection. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is planned for transfer to the floor."
