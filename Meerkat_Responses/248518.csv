","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who had a failed renal transplant and is still on immunosuppression. She presented with hypotension and fevers. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a mixed venous O2 saturation of 86%. The patient's physical examination reveals trace lower extremity edema and an obese abdomen with a mass in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. The assessment and plan include addressing hypotension, ESRD management, CMV viremia, diabetes mellitus type II, lupus, anemia, nutritional needs, and prophylaxis against pressure ulcers and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. This could be related to her immunosuppressed state or urinary tract infection due to the presence of an indwelling catheter.
2. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's abdominal examination findings indicate a mass in the right lower quadrant, which may represent an inflammatory process or tumor. Further evaluation with imaging studies is necessary.
3. Fluid overload: The negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours suggests the possibility of fluid overload. This could lead to pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Cardiac ischemia: Although the patient's hyp"

   HPI:
   52yoF with ESRD on HD, SLE, HTN, hypothyroidism, s/p failed transplant
   still on immunosuppresions, sent from rehab with hypotension and
   fevers.  She had recent cdiff colitis in [**8-6**], but restarted prior to
   admission empirically.  Also history of CMV viremia on gancylovir.
   She was admitted overnight with HoTN unresponsive to 4L fluid and
   required CVL placement and required levophed with evidence of sepsis.
   Her mental status was at baseline, lactate normal, and she is anuric at
   baseline.
   24 Hour Events:
   She was admitted to the ICU, complained of mild abdominal pain.  Denied
   cough/dyspnea/pain.
   She was weaned off levophed overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a previous failed transplant. She is currently on immunosuppressive medications. The patient was admitted overnight with hypotension unresponsive to 4 liters of fluid and required central venous pressure monitoring (CVL) placement and levophed support with evidence of sepsis. Her mental status was at baseline, lactate levels were normal, and she is anuric at baseline.

The patient complained of mild abdominal pain but denied cough, dyspnea, or pain. She was weaned off levophed overnight. The patient's allergies include Bactrim DS, Cellcept, and an exfoliative rash. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin at 09:50 PM on 11/6/2149.

The patient is receiving various medications including Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), neprhocaps, ASA 325mg, Hydrocortisone 100mg q8h, Insulin sliding scale, Tacrolimus, and others.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for mild abdominal pain. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure"

   suggestive of sepsis.
   1.  Hypotension: no evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion with normal
   mental status, no elevation in lactate; she is anuric at baseline.
   Given bandemia, fevers, leukocytosis, HoTN, suspect infectious
   etiology, though unclear source of infection but concern for her recent
   abdominal pain with possible occult abdominal abscess.
   - Empiric antibiotics for sepsis
   - straight cath to evaluate urine
   - Abd CT today
   - stress dose steroids
   2.  Sepsis:
   - vancomycin, zosyn, PO vancomycin, gancyclovir
   - ID consult
   - await cultures, cdiff, CMV

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a failed renal transplant and is still on immunosuppression. She presents with hypotension and fevers.

The patient has shown significant improvement in her hypotension, and she is no longer on levophed. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. CMV Viremia: The patient likely has a recurrence of CMV viremia as she was not on suppressive valgancyclovir. This requires further evaluation and management, including following up on CMV viral load and resistance genotype.

2. Diverticulitis: The CT abdomen/pelvis shows early diverticulitis. Clinical correlation is needed, and the patient should be monitored for any worsening symptoms or signs of infection.

3. Pancreatic Duct Dilatation: The CT also shows a dilated main pancreatic duct, which may indicate a possible segmental intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). The patient should be evaluated further by the pancreas center for this potential condition.

4. Transplanted Kidney: The transplanted kidney shows slightly more perinephric stranding, but there is no evidence of acute abscess or infection. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored.

5. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which is evident"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a failed renal transplant. She is currently experiencing hypotension and fevers while still on immunosuppression.

The note mentions that the patient's hypotension has significantly improved and she is no longer on levophed. There are suspicions of diverticulitis on CT abdomen/pelvis, which may explain some of the hypotension. C. difficile test results are negative, and other cultures are pending.

The patient is likely experiencing a recurrence of CMV viremia, as she should have been on suppressive valgancyclovir but was not. The CMV viral load is going up before starting gancyclovir, indicating that it is unlikely to be resistant.

The patient's assessment and plan include several points:
- Follow-up CMV viral load and resistance genotype.
- Continue IV vancomycin, IV piperacillin/tazobactam, and IV gancyclovir. Can likely stop PO vancomycin given the negative C. difficile test.
- Stress dose steroids.
- Blood cultures.
- Follow-up ID recommendations.
- Follow-up NESH CX.

For ESRD, the patient's electrolytes are non-urgent, and a discussion with the renal team is needed regarding the risks and benefits of continued immunosuppression. HD dose medications and tacrolimus"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a previous failed transplant on immunosuppression. She was admitted with recurrent fevers and hypotension suggestive of sepsis. The patient also has a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, CMV viremia treated with gancyclovir, and a recent episode of diverticulitis. She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and being treated with multiple antibiotics for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fevers, bandemia, leukocytosis, and anuria raise concerns for an infectious etiology, possibly related to her recent abdominal pain and potential occult abdominal abscess.
2. Diverticulitis: The patient's recent CT scan shows early signs of diverticulitis, which could lead to complications such as abscess formation or perforation.
3. C. diff colitis: Although the patient's recent C. diff test was negative, her history of previous C. diff infection increases her risk for recurrence.
4. CMV viremia: The patient's previous episode of CMV viremia, treated with gancyclovir, indicates a potential risk for relapse.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a history of failed kidney transplant. She was admitted with recurrent fevers and hypotension suggestive of sepsis. The source of sepsis is still unclear. The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile (c. diff) colitis, which is currently negative. She also has a history of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and is on ganciclovir treatment.

24-hour events include a CT scan showing early diverticulitis, no fluid taken off during HD, negative c. diff toxin, flu swab negative, and oliguria. The patient was on levophed overnight with HD and now off, but blood pressures in the 80s. Cultures are still unrevealing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a failed kidney transplant. She was admitted to the ICU from rehabilitation with hypotension and fevers. The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis, CMV viremia, and is currently on immunosuppressive therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fevers suggest a possible infection as the source of sepsis is still unclear. Immediate management should focus on identifying the source of infection and initiating appropriate antibiotics.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently below normal levels, indicating hypotension. This could be due to volume depletion or septic shock. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may be exacerbated by her current condition. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as adjusting dialysis frequency, may be required.

4. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient's history of Clostridium difficile colitis should be considered, especially if her symptoms worsen or she develops diarrhea. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive measures should be initiated if necessary.

5. CMV Viremia: The patient's history of CMV vire"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a failed kidney transplant on immunosuppression. She was admitted with hypotension and fevers, suggesting sepsis. The patient also has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis, CMV viremia treated with ganciclovir, and recent abdominal pain with possible occult abdominal abscess.

24-hour events include a CT scan of the abdomen showing early diverticulitis, no fluid removed during dialysis, negative c. diff, flu swab, and urine culture. The patient required levophed overnight and is back on hemodialysis.

The patient has allergies to Bactrim, Cellcept, and an exfoliative rash. She received multiple antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and ganciclovir.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is suspected to have sepsis with an unclear source of infection. She is hypotensive but without signs of end-organ hypoperfusion. There is concern for possible occult abdominal abscess due to recent abdominal pain. Empiric antibiotics for sepsis have been started, along with a straight catheter to evaluate urine output, abdominal CT, stress dose steroids, and ID consult. She is currently on hem"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a failed kidney transplant. She was admitted with recurrent fevers and hypotension, which are suggestive of sepsis. The source of sepsis remains unclear.

The patient's recent medical history includes c.diff colitis, CMV viremia, and a negative response to antibiotics. She also has allergies to Bactrim, Cellcept, and a rash reaction to antibiotics.

On examination, the patient is alert and oriented, with stable vital signs. She has a central line, and her blood cultures are negative. A CT scan shows early signs of diverticulitis but no abscess or fluid collection. Her blood work indicates leukocytosis, an elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to sepsis, considering her bandemia, fevers, and leukocytosis. She was on levophed overnight with hemodialysis but is now off pressors. However, her blood pressure remains in the 80s. Cultures have not revealed any pathogens, and she has a history of c.diff but negative toxin levels. The CT scan suggests early diverticulitis.

- The patient will receive a small fluid"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a renal transplant. She is currently experiencing hypotension and fevers, and her condition is complicated by CMV viremia. 

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure (98/49 mmHg) and a slightly elevated heart rate (63 bpm). Her respiratory rate is within normal range (19 breaths per minute), and she has a normal oxygen saturation level (SpO2: 98%). 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (5.2), potassium (5.1 K/uL), and slightly low levels of hemoglobin (9.0 g/dL). Her white blood cell count is within normal range (12.9), but her platelet count is slightly low (142). Her blood glucose level is well controlled (99 mg/dL).

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, lupus, and anemia. She is currently on immunosuppression due to the renal transplant.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's CMV viremia needs to be closely monitored, and further investigations such as resistance genotype and follow-up viral load should be conducted. The patient may require adjustments to her immunosuppression therapy. Additionally, the patient's ESRD requires ongoing management, including consideration of continued immunosuppression and discussions about the risks and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone a failed renal transplant and is still on immunosuppression. She presented with hypotension and fevers. The patient has been treated for potential infections, including CMV viremia and C. diff negative. She is currently off pressors, and her hypotension has resolved. Her electrolytes are non-urgent, with hemodialysis scheduled for Monday. The patient's CMV viremia has resolved, but she will continue IV gancyclovir. She also requires ID recommendations.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has since resolved. It is crucial to monitor her blood pressure closely to prevent any recurrence.
2. Infection: The patient's presentation included fevers, indicating a possible infection. The treatment for potential infections, such as CMV viremia and C. diff negative, suggests that she may be at risk for opportunistic infections due to her immunosuppressed state. Regular monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are essential.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are non-urgent, but it is important to monitor them closely, especially considering her ESRD and ongoing hemodialysis treatment.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, likely due to chronic renal failure. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin and hemat"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a failed transplant still on immunosuppression. She was sent from rehabilitation with hypotension and fevers. The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, which was treated empirically prior to admission. She also had cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, which is being treated with ganciclovir. The source of sepsis remains unclear.

The patient has received various antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and most recently, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). She has also been given pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include changes to her medical and family history.

Review of Systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: Flowsheet Data as of 11/9/2149 shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and more. The patient's blood pressure is in the 60s, heart rate is 65 bpm, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocyt"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a failed transplant on immunosuppression. She was admitted with recurrent fevers and hypotension, suggestive of sepsis. The patient has a background of diverticulitis, CMV viremia, and Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) in the past. Physical examination reveals sinus rhythm, normal oxygen saturation, and low blood pressure. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and negative CMV PCR. Imaging shows early diverticulitis. The patient's condition has been managed with IV antibiotics, gancyclovir, stress-dose steroids, and fluid resuscitation. The plan includes continuing IV vancomycin, zosyn, gancyclovir, discontinuing oral vancomycin, and following up with ID recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of recurrent fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggests sepsis. It is essential to continue aggressive management with IV antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and monitoring for any signs of organ dysfunction.
2. Diverticulitis: The CT scan indicates early diverticulitis. The patient should be kept on a low-residue diet to reduce further complications related to"
