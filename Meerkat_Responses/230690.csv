   artery and
   bronchi extending into this lingular region. Correlation with prior
   imaging
   recommended.
   5. Diffuse abnormality of the colon with enhancement of the mucosa and
   with
   submucosal thickening and pericolonic stranding which is diffuse. These
   findings are nonspecific and could represent an infectious colitis.
   Findings
   atypical for ischemic colitis due to sparing of small bowel. Trace free
   fluid
   tracking along left paracolic gutter into the pelvis.

   10. Gallbladder and spleen not well evaluated
   Assessment and Plan
   67yoF with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non small cell
   lung cancer who was intubated at an OSH for respiratory distress and
   transferred for further management of respirator failure.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: in the setting of known NSCLC. She had
   leukocytosis there w/bandemia. Otherwise, CXR revealed mass and left
   sided effusion, but no other acute changes. Exam is w/o evidence of
   COPD flare and CXR does not reveal evidence of PNA. Respiratory
   distress may have been secondary to primary metabolic acidosis.
   - does not appear to have high tumor burden causing respiratory failure
   - ABG here 7.14/55/405, changing vent settings to resolve resp
   acidosis, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - CT to further evaluate mass and r/o PE
   - correct metabolic acidosis
   - combivent MDIs as needed
   - continue advair
   - consider extubation once acidosis resolved
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis  - nongap at time of presentation to OSH ED; pt
   did have diarrhea; No h/o fevers and pt has been afebrile but
   w/leukocytosis to 33.7 and impressive bandemia and lactate of 3.2.
   - serial ABGs
   - monitor lytes
   - IV fluid boluses
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics for now
   - send blood, urine, and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - send c. diff
   .
   # NSCLC - had XRT to brain and per report had scheduled chemo
   - onc c/s
   - touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia - appears hypvolemic, but at risk for SIADH
   - IVF boluses
   - check urine lytes
   .
   # CAD -  no evidence of EKG changes, continue ASA, statin, hold
   antihypertensives for now
   .
   # H/O breast CA: stable w/o recurrence

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. She was intubated at an outside facility for respiratory distress and transferred for further management of respiratory failure. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, non-small cell lung cancer, hyponatremia, and coronary artery disease. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) due to the indwelling port and arterial line. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, correct metabolic acidosis, manage her lung cancer treatment, address hyponatremia, and manage her coronary artery disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   67yoF with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non small cell
   lung cancer who was intubated at an OSH for respiratory distress and
   transferred for further management of respirator failure.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: in the setting of known NSCLC. She had
   leukocytosis there w/bandemia. Otherwise, CXR revealed mass and left
   sided effusion, but no other acute changes. Exam is w/o evidence of
   COPD flare and CXR does not reveal evidence of PNA. Respiratory
   distress may have been secondary to primary metabolic acidosis.
   - does not appear to have high tumor burden causing respiratory failure
   - ABG here 7.14/55/405, changing vent settings to resolve resp
   acidosis, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - CT to further evaluate mass and r/o PE
   - correct metabolic acidosis
   - combivent MDIs as needed
   - continue advair
   - consider extubation once acidosis resolved
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis  - nongap at time of presentation to OSH ED; pt
   did have diarrhea; No h/o fevers and pt has been afebrile but
   w/leukocytosis to 33.7 and impressive bandemia and lactate of 3.2.
   - serial ABGs
   - monitor lytes
   - IV fluid boluses
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics for now
   - send blood, urine, and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - send c. diff
   .
   # NSCLC - had XRT to brain and per report had scheduled chemo
   - onc c/s
   - touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia - appears hypvolemic, but at risk for SIADH
   - IVF boluses
   - check urine lytes
   .
   # CAD -  no evidence of EKG changes, continue ASA, statin, hold
   antihypertensives for now
   .
   # H/O breast CA: stable w/o recurrence

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. She was intubated at an outside hospital for respiratory distress and transferred for further management of respiratory failure. The patient has leukocytosis with bandemia, a left-sided pleural effusion, but no other acute changes on chest X-ray. There is no evidence of COPD flare or pneumonia. The respiratory distress may have been secondary to primary metabolic acidosis.

The plan includes changing ventilator settings to resolve respiratory acidosis, decreasing FiO2 as tolerated, conducting a CT scan to further evaluate the mass and rule out pulmonary embolism, correcting metabolic acidosis, using Combivent MDIs as needed, continuing with Advair, and considering extubation once acidosis is resolved.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis with nongap at presentation, leukocytosis with bandemia, impressive lactate levels, and no fever. Serial ABGs, monitoring of electrolytes, IV fluid boluses, blood, urine, and sputum cultures, trending WBC count fever curve, and sending C. diff should be done. The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer and received XRT to the brain with scheduled chemotherapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and a history of colon cancer. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing tachycardia unresponsive to IV fluids. The patient also has a history of NG tube placement, and there is concern for possible C. difficile infection. The patient's CT scan shows multiple likely metastases to the bone, no pulmonary embolism, hydropneumothorax, stranding and thickening around the colon and rectum consistent with colitis, and diffuse atherosclerotic disease. The patient's labs show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's altered mental status, tachycardia unresponsive to IV fluids, leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and concern for possible C. difficile infection, there is a high risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and altered mental status may predispose him to pneumonia. Additionally, the presence of a hydropneumothorax on the CT scan could"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. She is currently intubated due to respiratory failure of unclear etiology but likely secondary to acid-base status. The patient's condition includes acute respiratory failure, underlying metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and a history of breast cancer with no evidence of recurrence. She also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diffuse atherosclerotic disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma from high airway pressures.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an underlying metabolic acidosis that needs to be managed carefully with appropriate fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are slightly improved but still low. Close monitoring and cautious fluid management are necessary to avoid complications associated with hyponatremia, such as seizures or neurological dysfunction.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI): The patient's recent antibiotic use increases the risk of CDI. Monitoring for symptoms and testing for C. difficile toxin are important to prevent and manage this potential complication.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for D"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who is intubated and experiencing respiratory failure. The cause of her respiratory failure is unclear but is likely multifactorial, secondary to acid-base status. The patient is currently being treated for acute respiratory failure, underlying metabolic acidosis, and potential infections such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and Enterobacter urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 129 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her fluid balance shows a total intake of 6,526 mL and a total output of 1,197 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, total parenteral nutrition (TF), and medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and others.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.4 thousand/mm3. Other lab values include a hematocrit of 30.5%, platelet count of 543 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin T level of less than 0.01 ng/mL, lactate level of 3.0 mmol/L, and blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, COPD, diarrhea, metabolic acidosis, and anemia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing tachypnea on pressure support ventilation (PSV) throughout the night with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of over 100. She has been started on Cipro for a positive urine culture. Despite tube feeds being initiated, her diarrhea persists. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation or if her underlying COPD condition deteriorates further.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Diarrhea: The persistent diarrhea can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which need to be addressed to prevent further complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may contribute to her overall poor condition and may require treatment to improve her oxygen carrying capacity.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to pain, sepsis, or other underlying conditions. Proper pain management and addressing potential infections are crucial in managing this complication.
6. Metastatic Lung Cancer: The patient's history of metastatic lung cancer"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status, respiratory failure, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set VT of 500 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 18, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 119. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and the skin examination is also not performed. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits, except for slightly elevated LDH and low albumin levels. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications, including codeine, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, vancomycin, fentanyl, famotidine, midazolam, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to the use of immunosuppressive medications and prolonged ICU stay, making him susceptible to infections. The elevated WBC count could indicate an ongoing infection.

2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is not within normal limits, with a total fluid intake of 5"

   67yoF with a hx of Breast CA and metastatic NSCLC remains intubated
   with respiratory failure of unclear etiology but likely multifactorial
   secondary to acid-base status.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure:  Originally thought to be secondary to
   inability to compensate. Appears more comfortable on exam this AM. Pt
   now mildly alkalemic, now on PS 10/5 at 40% with gas of 7.41/30/173
   with a Bicarb of 19.  [**Month (only) 51**] be [**12-20**] to pain, anxiety vs sepsis (C. Diff vs
   Enterobacter UTI.). Leukocytosis improved from 28 to 16.9.  Matching
   PEEP with potential autopeep.
   - Increasing pain control to see if this improves resp alkalosis
   - Following ABGs
   - Treat underlying infections as below.
   - Nebs PRN
   - Fentanyl and Midaz
   - Continue advair

   # Underlying Metabolic Acidosis: Lactate now 1.7. Gap and Non-Gap with
   improved Gap.  Pt with C. Diff, appears dry clinically and has
   enterobacter UTI previously untreated. Pt was +5L overnight.
   - IV fluid boluses PRN.
   - Cont Cipro for UTI
   - Cont IV Flagyl, PO Vanc for C. Diff
   - f/u blood, urine, and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve

   # NSCLC
 No current treatments. Per Lung CA, ULE no movement at
   baseline.
   - Followed closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 Slightly improved at 131 from 135. Most likely
   secondary to giving LR boluses (130 of Na) overnight.
   - Will discuss with team potentially holding IVF now that the pt
   appears more clinically euvolemic.
   .
   # HTN -  BP elevates with agitation. Stable overnight.

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. She remains intubated with respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated respiratory rate. Her oxygen saturation is within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She also received IV morphine for agitation and has been sedated with midazolam.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.7 thousand/mm3, slightly improved from the previous day. Her blood glucose level is within normal limits, but her lactic acid level is elevated at 2.1 mmol/L, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. Her electrolytes are mildly abnormal with hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Her renal function tests show an elevated creatinine level.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals tenderness and distention. Her neurologic examination shows gross movement on the left side, but no movement on the right upper extremity.

The patient's CT head shows no interval change from the previous day, ruling out any acute intracranial processes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. She is intubated and currently experiencing respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 66/58 to 66/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen, and a temperature of 35.7°C. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 5,756 mL and output of 965 mL. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, analgesics, sedatives, and heparin for prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to compensate for respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, secondary to acid-base status. It is important to monitor her ABGs and adjust ventilator settings accordingly. Increasing pain control may improve respiratory alkalosis.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a lactate level of 2.0, indicating a possible underlying metabolic acidosis. Treatment should focus on managing infections, particularly C. diff and enterobacter UTI, through appropriate antibiotic therapy and IV fluid boluses.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is slightly improved at 135 from 133. Fluid resuscitation with IVF boluses and following up with urine electrolytes"

   Assessment and Plan
   67yoF with a hx of Breast CA and metastatic NSCLC remains intubated
   with respiratory failure of unclear etiology but likely multifactorial
   secondary to acid-base status.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure:  Originally thought to be secondary to
   inability to compensate. Appears more comfortable on exam this AM. Pt
   now mildly alkalemic, now on PS 10/5 at 40% with gas of 7.41/30/173
   with a Bicarb of 19.  [**Month (only) 51**] be [**12-20**] to pain, anxiety vs sepsis (C. Diff vs
   Enterobacter UTI.). Leukocytosis improved from 28 to 16.9.  Matching
   PEEP with potential autopeep.
   - Increasing pain control to see if this improves resp alkalosis
   - Following ABGs
   - Treat underlying infections as below.
   - Nebs PRN
   - Fentanyl and Midaz
   - Continue advair
   - Will discuss with team regarding parameters for which to consider
   extubation given that patient continues to have high Auto-Peep.
   .
   # Underlying Metabolic Acidosis: Lactate now 1.7. Gap and Non-Gap with
   improved Gap.  Pt with C. Diff, appears dry clinically and has
   enterobacter UTI previously untreated. Pt was +5L overnight.
   - IV fluid boluses PRN.
   - Cont Cipro for UTI
   - Cont IV Flagyl, PO Vanc for C. Diff
   - f/u blood, urine, and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # NSCLC
 No current treatments. Per Lung CA, ULE no movement at
   baseline.
   - Followed closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**]
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 Slightly improved at 131 from 135. Most likely
   secondary to giving LR boluses (130 of Na) overnight.
   - Will discuss with team potentially holding IVF now that the pt
   appears more clinically euvolemic.
   .
   # HTN -  BP elevates with agitation. Stable overnight.
   - Hydral PRN
   .
   # H/O breast CA: stable w/o recurrence

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She remains intubated with respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 66/58 mmHg to 66/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient has received multiple treatments for various conditions, including antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Enterobacter species and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She has also received pain management medications and sedatives.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.7 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, elevated lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 131 mEq/L.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The assessment and plan include managing acute respiratory failure, underlying metabolic acidosis, NSCLC, hyponatremia, hypertension, and previous breast cancer. The team is considering parameters for extubation and closely monitoring the patient's condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further complications related to C. diff infection and UTI."

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, COPD, altered mental status, anemia, metastatic lung cancer, and C. difficile infection. The patient has been given additional narcotics for pain and dyspnea and is more alert in the morning. Tachycardia persists, and the patient remains on mechanical ventilation with a pressure support ventilation (PSV) level of 10.

The patient's white blood cell count has improved, and hematocrit levels remain stable. The patient has received various antibiotics and other medications, including narcotics for pain management. Allergies include codeine, with an unknown allergy.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 139 beats per minute, hypertension with a blood pressure of 183/103 mmHg, and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 98% on the ventilator. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows an input of 5,756 mL and output of 1,253 mL, resulting in a balance of 4,791 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 460 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She remains intubated with respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 150 bpm, blood pressure of 90/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 45 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, sedatives, and analgesics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to an inability to compensate, possibly due to acid-base status. It is important to monitor ABGs and treat underlying infections. Increasing pain control and discussing parameters for extubation should be considered.
2. Underlying Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a lactate level of 1.7, indicating metabolic acidosis. IV fluid boluses, continued treatment for UTI and C. Diff, and following up with blood, urine, and sputum cultures are necessary.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is slightly improved at 131 from 135, likely due to giving LR boluses overnight. Discussing with the team about potentially holding IVF now that the patient appears more clinically euvolemic is recommended.
4. HTN: The patient's blood pressure elevates with agitation but was"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. She remains intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0°F, heart rate of 150 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73-90/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 45 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been experiencing episodes of tachypnea and hypotension, requiring interventions such as bagging, increased sedation, and use of neosynephrine. The patient's blood culture and urine culture have been sent, and she has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection and an enterobacter urinary tract infection. She is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The patient also has hyponatremia, likely secondary to intravenous fluid administration, and her sodium level is being closely monitored. She has a history of hypertension but is currently stable on hydralazine as needed. The patient's respiratory status has improved with the adjustment of ventilator settings, and she is now on pressure support at 40% with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 7.41/30/173. The patient's pain and anxiety levels are being addressed with increased pain control and medication adjustments. The team is"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She remains intubated with respiratory failure of unclear etiology but likely multifactorial secondary to acid-base status. The patient experienced an episode of tachypnea and hypotension at around 10 pm, which responded to fluid resuscitation. She was subsequently placed back on full pressure support and sedated, with subsequent improvement in her vital signs.
