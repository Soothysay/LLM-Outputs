","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with dyspnea and fatigue. She had evidence of anemia on admission, which is secondary to blood loss. She also has a history of gastric and duodenal ulcers. The patient has significant edema and fluid overload, as indicated by physical examination findings and imaging results.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, with a blood pressure of 118/53 mmHg and a heart rate of 69 bpm. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and she has an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. She is in atrial fibrillation.

Her laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL and a hematocrit of 27.6%. Her platelet count is slightly low at 333 K/uL, and her total white blood cell count is within normal range at 10.4. Her creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.4, and her glucose level is within normal limits at 117 mg/dL.

Imaging studies reveal bilateral peri-hilar infiltrates on chest X-ray and dilated right atrium with echogenic liver suggesting volume overload on CT scan.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8815**] is a 79 yo F with PMH CAD (LAD/RCA stents), gastric and
   duodenal ulcers, recently treated H pylori presenting with anemia (HCT
   29->20) likely due to upper GI bleed, no evidence of active bleeding at
   this time.
   .
   #Anemia - most likely due to recurrent UGI bleeding from known gastric
   and duodenal ulcers.  Other possiblility is AVM.  No evidence of active
   GI bleeding at this time as NG lavage in the ED stable. HCT down to 20
   from 29 one month priro. Hemodynamically stable.  She did have recent
   colonoscopy that showed diverticulosis but she has not had any blood
   per rectum so this is unlikely cause.
   -transfuse for goal HCT ~30 given CHF on admission likely [**3-16**] cardiac
   dysfunction in the setting of severe ischemia
   -INR elevated theraputic at 2.5, will not reverse as no evidence of
   active bleeding, hold coumadin for now
   -seen by GI in the ED, no plan for emergent scope given no evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -f/u GI reccs
   -two large bore IV's for access
   -protonix 40 IV BID
   -per GI capsule endoscopy as an outpatient
   .
   #Acute diastolic heart failure - with right sided volume overload on
   recent CT scan as evidenced by RA dilation/hepatic congestion and
   abdominal fluid.  Most likely [**3-16**] cardiac dysfunction in the setting of
   severe anemia in setting of known CAD.  No evidence of active
   myocaridal infarction, first set of CE's negative.  Other consideration
   is that she has had an recent myocardial infarction with worsened heart
   function resulting in new development of chf and right sided volume
   overload.
   -transfuse to goal of HCT 30 as above
   - met goal of negative 1.5 liters
   -ecg in the am
   .
   #Acute renal failure - most likely [**3-16**] decreased renal perfusion in the
   setting of severe anemia and acute diastolic heart failure resulting in
   prerenal state.  Would expect improvement with transfusion.  No
   evidence of UTI on UA.
   -transfuse as above
   -check urine lytes
   -trend creatinine
   -renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #CAD - h/o LAD and RCA stents several years ago, not on plavix.  No
   evidence of active ischemia.  EKG without evidence of acute ischemia
   and first set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   -hold ASA for now given concern for UGIB
   -continue statin
   -holding BB overnight
   -
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation - currently well rate controlled, she reports
   taking her dilt sr already today.  Will hold BB for now given anemia
   and possible acute GI bleed
   -holding metoprolol, consider resuming in the AM if HCT stable and no
   evidence of active bleeding.
   -conrtinued dilt
   -INR currently theraputic
   -hold coumadin given recent GI bleed pending GI evaluation and possible
   scope
   .
   #hyperlipidemia - continue home dose atorvastatin
   .
   #Hypertension -
   -holding BB and HCTZ
   -holding dilt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), gastric and duodenal ulcers, and recently treated H. pylori. She presented with anemia likely due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from known gastric and duodenal ulcers. There is no evidence of active bleeding at this time. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 29 to 20 over the past month. She also has a history of diverticulosis but no blood per rectum.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has been admitted to the ICU for further management. She has been transfused with blood products to reach a target hematocrit (Hct) of 30. Her INR is elevated at 2.5, which is therapeutic but will not be reversed as there is no evidence of active bleeding. Coumadin has been held pending GI evaluation and possible scope. The patient's atrial fibrillation is well rate-controlled, and she has been taking her diltiazem regularly.

The patient's recent colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, but this is unlikely to be the cause of her anemia. The most likely cause of her anemia is recurrent UGIB from known gastric and duodenal ulcers. Other possibilities include an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). No evidence of active GI bleeding is observed, and the patient's NG lavage in"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8815**] is a 79 yo F with PMH CAD (LAD/RCA stents), gastric and
   duodenal ulcers, recently treated H pylori presenting with anemia (HCT
   29->20) likely due to upper GI bleed, no evidence of active bleeding at
   this time.
   .
   #Anemia - most likely due to recurrent UGI bleeding from known gastric
   and duodenal ulcers.  Other possiblility is AVM.  No evidence of active
   GI bleeding at this time as NG lavage in the ED stable. HCT down to 20
   from 29 one month priro. Hemodynamically stable.  She did have recent
   colonoscopy that showed diverticulosis but she has not had any blood
   per rectum so this is unlikely cause.
   -transfuse for goal HCT ~30 given CHF on admission likely [**3-16**] cardiac
   dysfunction in the setting of severe ischemia
   -INR elevated theraputic at 2.5, will not reverse as no evidence of
   active bleeding, hold coumadin for now
   -seen by GI in the ED, no plan for emergent scope given no evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -f/u GI reccs
   -two large bore IV's for access
   -protonix 40 IV BID
   -per GI capsule endoscopy as an outpatient
   .
   #Acute diastolic heart failure - with right sided volume overload on
   recent CT scan as evidenced by RA dilation/hepatic congestion and
   abdominal fluid.  Most likely [**3-16**] cardiac dysfunction in the setting of
   severe anemia in setting of known CAD.  No evidence of active
   myocaridal infarction, first set of CE's negative.  Other consideration
   is that she has had an recent myocardial infarction with worsened heart
   function resulting in new development of chf and right sided volume
   overload.
   -transfuse to goal of HCT 30 as above
   - met goal of negative 1.5 liters
   -ecg in the am
   .
   #Acute renal failure - most likely [**3-16**] decreased renal perfusion in the
   setting of severe anemia and acute diastolic heart failure resulting in
   prerenal state.  Would expect improvement with transfusion.  No
   evidence of UTI on UA.
   -transfuse as above
   -check urine lytes
   -trend creatinine
   -renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #CAD - h/o LAD and RCA stents several years ago, not on plavix.  No
   evidence of active ischemia.  EKG without evidence of acute ischemia
   and first set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   -hold ASA for now given concern for UGIB
   -continue statin
   -holding BB overnight
   -
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation - currently well rate controlled, she reports
   taking her dilt sr already today.  Will hold BB for now given anemia
   and possible acute GI bleed
   -holding metoprolol, consider resuming in the AM if HCT stable and no
   evidence of active bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), gastric and duodenal ulcers, and recently treated Helicobacter pylori infection. She presented with anemia likely due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from known gastric and duodenal ulcers. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with several ongoing medical issues.

Assessment and plan:
1. Anemia - The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has decreased from 29 to 20 over the past month, indicating ongoing blood loss. The most likely cause of anemia is recurrent UGIB from the gastric and duodenal ulcers. Other possibilities include arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The patient is being transfused to a target HCT of around 30.
2. Acute diastolic heart failure - The patient has evidence of right-sided volume overload on a recent CT scan, including RA dilation and hepatic congestion. This could be due to cardiac dysfunction in the setting of severe anemia or a recent myocardial infarction with worsened heart function.
3. Acute renal failure - The patient has a decreased renal perfusion in the setting of severe anemia and acute diastolic heart failure. This may result in a pre-renal state. The patient's renal function is expected to improve with transfusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), gastric and duodenal ulcers, and recent treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. She presented with anemia likely due to an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical conditions and plans.

1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has improved from 29 to 20 and is now stable at 30.3. This suggests that the bleeding has stopped. The plan is to transfuse blood to achieve a goal Hct of 27-28 due to congestive heart failure (CHF) on admission, likely secondary to severe ischemia.

2. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of right-sided volume overload on a recent CT scan, indicating RA dilation and hepatic congestion. This is likely due to cardiac dysfunction in the setting of severe anemia and known CAD. The plan is to transfuse to a goal Hct of 30 as previously mentioned.

3. Acute Renal Failure: This condition has resolved, likely due to decreased renal perfusion in the setting of severe anemia and acute diastolic heart failure. The creatinine level has improved to 1.1.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo female admit with GIB, no evidence of current bleeding and has
   actually tolerated diuresis to date.  Concern if for ulcer source of
   bleeding and follow up EGD is planned.
   1)Anemia Secondary to Blood Loss-
   -HCT to [**Hospital1 **]
   -Consider transfusion for significant decline to <21
   2)Altered LFT's--This is in the setting of regular EtOH use and we have
   seen an ultrasound of the RUQ without obstruction or GB involvement.
   No further increase seen in enzyme levels
   -Follow trend
   3)GIB-
   -GI for endoscopy on Monday
   4)CHF-
   -Conintued negative fluid balance with GIB controlled

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old female admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The note states that there is no evidence of current bleeding and the patient has tolerated diuresis well. The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1) Anemia Secondary to Blood Loss - The patient's hematocrit (HCT) level is mentioned as 27.6%. If this continues to decline significantly, transfusion may be considered when the HCT falls below 21%.

2) Altered Liver Function Tests (LFTs) - The patient has altered LFTs, likely due to regular ethanol use. However, no further increase in enzyme levels has been observed, and the trend should be monitored.

3) Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB) - An upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is planned on Monday to identify the source of bleeding and provide appropriate treatment.

4) Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Chronic - The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure, and efforts will continue to be made to manage fluid balance and control GIB.

Other conditions mentioned in the note include altered neurologic status and altered respiratory status, but no specific assessments or plans are mentioned for these conditions in the given note.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the mentioned conditions include:

- Continued blood loss leading to severe anemia and potential shock.
- Progression of heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath,"
