   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 88 year old male with history of CAD s/p stent to LCx
   (06), moderate to severe AS and diastolic dysfunction who was
   transferred from [**Hospital3 519**] for cath.  Catheterization was
   complicated by acute LAD occlusion during attempt to pass pressure wire
   and resultant VF arrest.  Spontaneous circulation returned after
   multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine and amiodarone.
   .
   #. CAD: Known history of CAD s/p stent to LCx.  Cath today notable for
   stenosis distal to LCx stent.  During evaluation of anatomy patient
   developed TO of LAD which is known to supply collaterals to occluded
   RCA as well.  This resulted in VF arrest requiring multiple shocks,
   amiodarone, lidocaine.  A BMS was able to be placed to the LAD with
   resultant good flow.  Arrest is due to ischemia as clearly evidenced on
   catheterization TO of LAD so patient should improve now that coronary
   is reopened.
   - Continue IABP and follow MAPs on pump.  Continue dopamine as needed
   to maintain MAPs.  .
   - Continue to cycle enzymes.
   - Heparin gtt once arterial sheath is pulled.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix
   - High dose statin
   - Consider repeat catheterization once acute issues resolved to
   intervene on LCx.
   - Check echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   # s/p intubation: In setting of VF arrest no acute hypoxic or
   hypercarbic event.
   - Confirm tube placement with CXR.
   - Continue on mechanical ventilation overnight
   - Place Aline to follow ABGs.
   .
   #. Pump: Diastolic heart failure, aortic stenosis.  Initially with PCWP
   of 15, however after arrest PCWP elevated to 35.
   - Follow volume status with swan.  Diurese as able.
   - Once patient is no longer hypotensive consider restarting beta
   blocker and ACE inhibitor.
   - Check echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   #. Rhythm: Currently in sinus rhythm s/p VF arrest.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Given arrhythmia was most likely due to acute ischemia will hold on
   continuing Amiodarone gtt for now
   - Holding beta blocker [**12-31**] bradycardia and hypotension
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Creatinine 1.6 post arrest.
   - Trend creatinine.
   - Renally dose all meds.
   .
   # Hypertension: On pressors.
   - Hold imdur, beta blocker.
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - Continue statin
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Continue insulin as per home regimen
   - FS QID
   - Check A1c

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previously treated with a stent to the left circumflex artery (LCx). He also has moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and diastolic dysfunction. The patient was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization. During the procedure, there was an acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), leading to ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient's spontaneous circulation returned after multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine, and amiodarone.

The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS) to the LAD, resulting in good flow. The arrest is attributed to ischemia due to the total occlusion (TO) of the LAD, which should improve now that the coronary artery has been reopened.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is currently on pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAPs). This indicates that the patient may be at risk of hypotension, especially if the pressors are tapered off or discontinued.

2. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia, for which amiodarone was held. Monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is essential to prevent further episodes of bradycardia.

   .
   # CARDIAC ARREST/SHOCK: Pt is waking up, remains intubated. Remains
   with assistance of IABP, though has good pressures to suggest that we
   will be able to wean this today, along with the dopamine. Our plan will
   be to go to 1:2 right now and if tolerated, will try a rapid wean q2h.
   Will wean dopamine as tolerated. Remain on anticoagulation given IABP.
   After IABP able to be removed, will seek extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous stent placement in the left circumflex artery, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and diastolic dysfunction. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing an acute occlusion in the left anterior descending artery during catheterization, which resulted in ventricular fibrillation and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient received multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine, and amiodarone, and spontaneous circulation returned. He remains intubated and is supported by an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The plan is to wean off dopamine and IABP if tolerated and consider extubation after IABP removal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's recent cardiac arrest indicates a high risk for recurrent arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or worsening ischemia.
3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's moderate to severe aortic stenosis may lead to symptoms such as syncope, angina, or heart failure exacerbation.
4. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's diastolic dysfunction can contribute to heart failure symptoms and may worsen with ongoing ischemia or stress.
5. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest possible renal insufficiency"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 88 year old male with history of CAD s/p stent to LCx
   (06), moderate to severe AS and diastolic dysfunction who was
   transferred from [**Hospital3 519**] for cath.  Catheterization was
   complicated by acute LAD occlusion during attempt to pass pressure wire
   and resultant VF arrest.  Spontaneous circulation returned after
   multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine and amiodarone.
   .
   # CARDIAC ARREST/SHOCK: Pt is waking up, remains intubated. Remains
   with assistance of IABP, though has good pressures to suggest that we
   will be able to wean this today, along with the dopamine. Our plan will
   be to go to 1:2 right now and if tolerated, will try a rapid wean q2h.
   Will wean dopamine as tolerated. Remain on anticoagulation given IABP.
   After IABP able to be removed, will seek extubation.
   #. CAD: Known history of CAD s/p stent to LCx.  [**Month (only) 8**] need to

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after experiencing an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac arrest. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which resulted in acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and subsequent ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. Spontaneous circulation returned after multiple defibrillation shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine, and amiodarone administration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's condition indicates cardiogenic shock due to the acute MI and cardiac arrest. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The rising creatinine levels post-cardiac arrest suggest renal insufficiency. AKI may occur due to decreased renal perfusion during cardiogenic shock.
3. Ventricular Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of VF arrest, there is a risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring and antiarrhythmic therapy may be required.
4. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Diabetic Complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which can be exacerbated by stress, critical illness, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 88 year old male with history of CAD s/p stent to LCx
   (06), moderate to severe AS and diastolic dysfunction who was
   transferred from [**Hospital3 519**] for cath.  Catheterization was
   complicated by acute LAD occlusion during attempt to pass pressure wire
   and resultant VF arrest.  Spontaneous circulation returned after
   multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine and amiodarone.
   .
   #. CAD: Known history of CAD s/p stent to LCx.  Cath today notable for
   stenosis distal to LCx stent.  During evaluation of anatomy patient
   developed TO of LAD which is known to supply collaterals to occluded
   RCA as well.  This resulted in VF arrest requiring multiple shocks,
   amiodarone, lidocaine.  A BMS was able to be placed to the LAD with
   resultant good flow.  Arrest is due to ischemia as clearly evidenced on
   catheterization TO of LAD so patient should improve now that coronary
   is reopened.
   - Continue IABP and follow MAPs on pump.  Continue dopamine as needed
   to maintain MAPs.  .
   - Continue to cycle enzymes.
   - Heparin gtt once arterial sheath is pulled.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix
   - High dose statin
   - Consider repeat catheterization once acute issues resolved to
   intervene on LCx.
   - Check echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   # s/p intubation: In setting of VF arrest no acute hypoxic or
   hypercarbic event.
   - Confirm tube placement with CXR.
   - Continue on mechanical ventilation overnight
   - Place Aline to follow ABGs.
   .
   #. Pump: Diastolic heart failure, aortic stenosis.  Initially with PCWP
   of 15, however after arrest PCWP elevated to 35.
   - Follow volume status with swan.  Diurese as able.
   - Once patient is no longer hypotensive consider restarting beta
   blocker and ACE inhibitor.
   - Check echocardiogram in the AM.
   .
   #. Rhythm: Currently in sinus rhythm s/p VF arrest.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Given arrhythmia was most likely due to acute ischemia will hold on
   continuing Amiodarone gtt for now
   - Holding beta blocker [**12-31**] bradycardia and hypotension
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Creatinine 1.6 post arrest.
   - Trend creatinine.
   - Renally dose all meds.
   .
   # Hypertension: On pressors.
   - Hold imdur, beta blocker.
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - Continue statin
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Continue insulin as per home regimen
   - FS QID
   - Check A1c
   .
   #. FEN:
   - OG tube in place
   - Follow lytes and replete PRN
   .
   #. Access:

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent cardiac catheterization due to moderate to severe aortic stenosis and diastolic dysfunction. During the procedure, there was an acute occlusion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) resulting in ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient's spontaneous circulation returned after multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine, and amiodarone. A bare metal stent (BMS) was placed in the LAD with good flow. The arrest was caused by ischemia due to the occlusion of the LAD.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. CAD: Known history of CAD with a previous stent placement in the left circumflex artery (LCx). The recent catheterization showed stenosis distal to the LCx stent.
2. VF arrest: The patient developed VF arrest during the evaluation of anatomy, which required multiple shocks, amiodarone, and lidocaine for resuscitation.
3. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG): The patient has undergone CABG surgery in the past.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 1.6 post-arrest.
5. Diabetic mellitus: The patient has diabetes and is on insulin therapy.
6. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive and requires pressors.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and diastolic dysfunction. He was transferred to the ICU for cardiac catheterization but experienced an acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery during the procedure, leading to ventricular fibrillation arrest. Spontaneous circulation returned after multiple shocks and administration of epinephrine, lidocaine, and amiodarone.

The patient remains intubated and requires the assistance of intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP). His blood pressure is being supported with dopamine. The plan is to wean off dopamine and IABP gradually if tolerated. The patient will be monitored closely for any changes in renal function, as his creatinine levels are rising post-arrest. Medications will be adjusted based on renal function.

The patient has a known history of coronary artery disease and requires revascularization of the left circumflex artery. He also has aortic stenosis and chronic diastolic congestive heart failure. His current rhythm is sinus, but he will continue to be monitored on telemetry. Other medical issues include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency.

The patient is currently receiving appropriate nutrition and glycemic control. He has multiple lines in place, including a pulmonary artery catheter, arterial line, and peripheral IV line. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent a stent placement in the left circumflex artery. He also has moderate to severe aortic stenosis and diastolic dysfunction. The patient was transferred to the ICU for cardiac catheterization, which was complicated by an acute occlusion in the left anterior descending artery, resulting in ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Spontaneous circulation returned after multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine, and amiodarone.

The patient experienced cardiogenic shock, which has since resolved. The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was weaned off and removed. The patient is now extubated and off dopamine and other pressors. His mean systemic arterial pressure (MSAP) has improved.

The patient has a known history of coronary artery disease and needs revascularization of the left circumflex artery. He is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. Metoprolol has been started at 2.5 mg IV every 6 hours, with a plan to transition to oral administration if tolerated.

The patient's rhythm is currently sinus, following the ventricular fibrillation arrest. Telemetry monitoring will be continued, and further amiodarone is not required at this time.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with rising creatinine levels post-arrest, likely due to poor forward"

   Patient is an 88 year old male with history of CAD s/p stent to LCx
   (06), moderate to severe AS and diastolic dysfunction who was
   transferred from [**Hospital3 519**] for cath.  Catheterization was
   complicated by acute LAD occlusion during attempt to pass pressure wire
   and resultant VF arrest.  Spontaneous circulation returned after
   multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine and amiodarone.

   # CARDIAC ARREST/SHOCK: Pt with VF secondary to acute LAD occlussion
   s/p PCI. Cardiogenic shock resolved. IABP weaned off and removed last
   pm.  Off pressors. MS improved and now extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous stent placement in the left circumflex artery, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and diastolic dysfunction. He was transferred to the ICU for cardiac catheterization. During the procedure, he experienced an acute occlusion in the left anterior descending artery, leading to ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, including multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine, and amiodarone. Spontaneous circulation returned after treatment. The patient developed cardiogenic shock, which has since resolved. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support was provided and eventually removed. The patient was extubated this morning. His current medications include aspirin, Plavix, and a statin. He also requires ongoing management for renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and fluid electrolyte balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's initial presentation of VF arrest and subsequent cardiogenic shock indicates a significant cardiac event. Continued monitoring and management of cardiac function are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest renal insufficiency, which may progress to AKI if not properly managed. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate fluid and medication management are crucial.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent stenting for a blocked left circumflex artery (LCx) in 2006. He also has moderate to severe aortic stenosis and diastolic dysfunction. The patient was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for cardiac catheterization. During the procedure, there was an acute occlusion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and subsequent ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient's spontaneous circulation returned after multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine, and amiodarone.

The patient remains intubated and is currently on assistance with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). His blood pressure is stable, but his creatinine levels are rising post-arrest. The plan is to wean off the IABP and dopamine if tolerated. The patient will be monitored closely for any potential complications such as cardiac arrest, rhythm disturbances, renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and access site complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: Given the patient's history of VF arrest and ongoing cardiac issues, there is a risk of recurrent cardiac arrest.
2. Rhythm disturbances: The patient may develop arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, due to underlying heart disease and previous VF arrest.
3. Renal insufficiency: The rising creatinine levels indicate declining renal function, which may require dose adjustments of medications and careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance.
4. Access site complications: The patient has arterial lines and a PA catheter in place, which pose a risk of bleeding or infection at the access sites.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent or manage DKA or hyperglycemia.
6. Infection: Prolonged intubation and ICU stay increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional details from other sources may be necessary for a more comprehensive assessment."

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization, which was complicated by acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) during the procedure. This resulted in ventricular fibrillation arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. The patient then received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-LAD with bare metal stent (BMS) placement and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal.

The patient's chest pain has persisted overnight, with worsening ST depression infero-laterally. His vital signs are stable, with blood pressure within normal range and heart rate within expected limits. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% with the use of a nasal cannula. The patient is extubated and breathing spontaneously. Fluid balance shows a net intake of 49 mL and output of 1,357 mL, with a urine output of 505 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg and pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 55/20 mmHg.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent cardiac catheterization. During the procedure, there was an acute occlusion in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, resulting in ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. After multiple shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine, and amiodarone were administered, spontaneous circulation returned. The patient experienced cardiogenic shock but has since recovered and was extubated.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute LAD occlusion during catheterization leading to VF arrest.
2. Cardiogenic shock resolved.
3. Renal insufficiency with rising creatinine levels post-arrest.
4. Hypertension.
5. Hyperlipidemia.
6. Diabetes mellitus.
7. Fever.
8. Potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9. Stress ulcer.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.
11. Potential risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial infarction.
2. Heart failure.
3. Arrhythmias.
4. Stroke.
5. Pulmonary embolism.
6. Infection.
7. Kidney injury.
8. Liver dysfunction.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which was complicated by acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) during the procedure. This resulted in ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. The patient received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-LAD with placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS) and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal.

The patient's current condition includes chest pain overnight with worsening of ST depression infero-laterally. He has a known tight lesion of the left circumflex artery (LCx) and a recent LAD lesion. Repeat catheterization is planned today. The patient is also diagnosed with aortic stenosis and chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to ongoing chest pain and dynamic ECG changes.
2. Cardiogenic shock due to poor cardiac output and hypotension.
3. Arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or VF, due to ischemic heart disease.
4. Kidney injury or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to renal hypoperfusion and rising creatinine levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of sharp left arm pain after repositioning in bed. The pain was initially rated at 7-7 but decreased to 4-6 during the time of an EKG. The pain then resolved with no intervention. The patient also experienced chest pain rated at 6-6 with a feeling of left arm and shoulder pain. An EKG showed deeper ST depression in inf leads, which resolved on its own. The patient responded to 1st dose of sublingual nitro and cycled enzymes. Urine electrolytes were sent, and the swan was de-ced. The patient was changed from IV to PO lopressor.

Medical Complications:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's symptoms of chest pain, EKG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest a possible ACS. This is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned in the progress note, the patient's elevated blood glucose levels may indicate poor glycemic control, which can lead to DKA.
4. Heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, which may be exacerbated by acute events such as ACS.

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which was complicated by acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) during the procedure. This resulted in ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, but the patient was successfully resuscitated and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the mid-LAD. The patient also had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) inserted.

The patient's current medical conditions include aortic stenosis, chronic diastolic heart failure, renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and fever. The patient is being managed with multiple medications including antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, statins, and medications for glycemic control.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/51 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and temperature of 37.1°C. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits, and the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) is slightly elevated at 20 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated tropon"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent catheterization, which resulted in acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) during the procedure. The patient experienced ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient is currently extubated and in sinus rhythm post-VF arrest and emergent revascularization. He has ongoing chest pain with worsening ST depression infero-laterally. The patient has multiple medical conditions including aortic stenosis, chronic diastolic heart failure, renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and fever. He is being managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) with various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's presentation with NSTEMI and subsequent VF arrest indicates ongoing ischemia and potential for further ACS events.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of CAD, aortic stenosis, and diastolic dysfunction puts him at risk for cardiogenic shock, especially considering the recent acute LAD occlusion and VF arrest.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic diastolic heart"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), specifically a previous left circumflex artery (LCx) occlusion and moderate to severe aortic stenosis. The patient presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization, which was complicated by acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) during the procedure. This resulted in a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which was successfully resuscitated and the patient received a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the mid-LAD and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient is now experiencing chest pain with dynamic ECG changes and has worsening ST depression infero-laterally.

Assessment and Plan:
1. CAD: Known history of CAD with previous LCx occlusion, now s/p PCI.
   - Continue ASA and Plavix.
   - Start heparin gtt and integrillin due to pain with dynamic ECG changes.
   - Repeat catheterization today.
   - Continue metoprolol and statin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). During catheterization, there was an acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), leading to ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was resuscitated. He has been experiencing left shoulder pain, which resolved with Dilaudid. The patient denies any new ECG changes and has refused further coronary angiography. His ribs feel sore, especially during coughing, but he denies shortness of breath or palpitations. The patient's allergies include codeine, and he has a known allergy to an unknown medication. He has been receiving infusions of heparin sodium and dilaudid. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/50-143/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,102 mL and output of 2,090 mL, resulting in a balance of 12 mL. 

Physical examination reveals jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 10 cm, regular rate and rhythm (RRR) with 2/6 S3 gallop auscultated at the right upper sternal border (RUSB), clear lungs, soft non-tender abdomen, and 1+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 23.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.4 g/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 122 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 2.4 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.8 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 3.39 ng/mL. Other labs are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has a history of CAD, previous left circumflex artery (LCx) stenting, moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS), and diastolic dysfunction. He presented with NSTEMI and experienced VF arrest due to acute LAD occlusion during catheterization. The patient has undergone PCI and removal of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The plan includes continuing aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel (Plavix), starting heparin and integrin due to chest pain and dynamic ECG changes, repeat catheterization, and continuation of metoprolol and statin therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications may include:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's presentation with NSTEMI and VF arrest indicates ongoing myocardial ischemia. Continued chest pain with dynamic ECG changes suggests the possibility of ongoing ischemia or progression of ACS.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and AS, along with the acute occlusion of LAD, increases the risk of cardiogenic shock. The patient's blood pressure fluctuations and reduced forward flow may indicate inadequate cardiac output.
3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's rising creatinine levels post-arrest suggest acute kidney injury (AKI), likely related to poor renal perfusion. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient's recent VF arrest increases the risk of recurrent arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential to detect any rhythm disturbances.
5. Infection: Prolonged catheterization and hospitalization increase the risk of infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
6. Thromboembolism: The patient's immobil"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which was complicated by acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) during the procedure. This resulted in a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, and the patient received immediate revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal.

The patient has a known history of CAD with previous lesion in the left circumflex artery (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA), which is now occluded. The patient continues to experience chest pain overnight with worsening of ST depression infero-laterally. The plan for repeat catheterization has been made today.

The patient also has aortic stenosis and chronic diastolic heart failure. His intravenous (IV) fluid goal is to hold further diuresis pending repeat catheterization. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm after experiencing VF arrest and emergent revascularization. He is being monitored on telemetry.

Additionally, the patient has renal insufficiency with rising creatinine post-arrest, likely related to poor forward flow. The patient's medications are being dosed based on renal function. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He is on a cardiac diet and receives nutrition and glycemic control as per ICU care.

The patient has multiple lines, including a peripheral IV line and an arterial line. Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to continue in the critical care unit (CCU)."

","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of left shoulder pain, which later resolved with dilaudid. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, chronic diastolic heart failure, impaired skin integrity, and acute coronary syndrome. 

Vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 36.8 to 98.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 74-84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/48 to 143/61 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium through an IV line, as well as hydromorphone (dilaudid) for pain management. Other medications include prophylactic heparin. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the shoulder pain. 

Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable vital signs with no significant changes. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,102 mL and output of 2,090 mL, resulting in a balance of 12 mL. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab values, including cardiac enzymes, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, are either within normal range or slightly elevated.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which was complicated by acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and resulted in ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient is currently extubated and in sinus rhythm post VF arrest and emergent revascularization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient has a history of CAD and presented with NSTEMI. There is a possibility of recurrent chest pain and dynamic ST depression infero-laterally.
2. Cardiac arrest/shock: The patient experienced VF secondary to acute LAD occlusion. There is a risk of further cardiac events.
3. Aortic stenosis and chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient has moderate to severe aortic stenosis and diastolic dysfunction, which can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath and fluid retention.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are rising post-arrest, likely related to poor forward flow. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, although it is currently an inactive issue.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). During catheterization, he experienced acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-LAD and had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removed. He is currently extubated and in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent chest pain with dynamic ST depression infero-laterally: This indicates ongoing ischemia and potential progression of coronary artery disease. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications may be required.
2. Renal insufficiency: The rising creatinine levels post-arrest suggest poor forward flow, likely contributing to renal dysfunction. Frequent monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains relatively low, indicating a need for ongoing hemodynamic monitoring and appropriate management.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of VF arrest and is currently on telemetry. Continuous cardiac monitoring is necessary to detect any rhythm abnormalities promptly.
5. Diabetic control: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and close glycemic control is crucial for his overall well-being and to prevent complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), including a previous myocardial infarction (MI) and moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS). He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. The procedure was complicated by acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), resulting in ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. The patient received a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with implantation of a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the mid-LAD and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal.

The patient's current condition includes recurrent chest pain with dynamic ST depression infero-laterally. He is on dual antiplatelet therapy (ASA and Plavix), heparin infusion, metoprolol, and statin therapy. The plan is to continue these medications and schedule a repeat cardiac catheterization to address the known tight lesion in the left circumflex artery (LCx). 

The patient also has a history of renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 130/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, troponin-T, CK-MB, and cardiac enzymes, along with elevated blood glucose levels. Other labs reveal renal dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, AS, recent VF arrest, and ongoing chest pain with dynamic ECG changes, there is a risk of recurrent cardiac events such as arrhythmias, further MI, or cardiac shock.
2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, which may be related to poor forward flow following the cardiac arrest. This could potentially lead to acute kidney injury or require renal replacement therapy.
3. Infection: Prolonged use of invasive lines and devices, such as the IABP, increases the risk of bloodstream infections.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy with heparin, which poses a risk for bleeding complications.
5. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and poor glycemic control may increase the risk of infections and other complications.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's sore ribs and cough could predispose him to respiratory infections or compromise his respiratory status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent catheterization, which was complicated by acute occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery during the procedure, resulting in ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient received immediate revascularization and is now extubated. The patient has a known history of moderate to severe aortic stenosis and diastolic dysfunction. He is currently in sinus rhythm post-VF arrest and emergent revascularization. The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by rising creatinine levels post-arrest. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's impaired renal function and rising creatinine levels indicate a potential risk of developing AKI. This could be due to poor forward flow during the VF arrest or other underlying renal issues.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of CAD and recent VF arrest, there is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias. Monitoring on telemetry will help detect any abnormal heart rhythms promptly.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and it is essential to maintain strict glycemic control to prevent complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
4. Infection: Prolonged hospital stay and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which was complicated by acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) during the procedure, leading to ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient received immediate revascularization and is now extubated and in sinus rhythm.

The patient's current medical conditions include aortic stenosis, chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF), renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and fever. The patient is currently on various medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, metoprolol, statin, and sliding scale insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include recurrent chest pain, dynamic ST depression infero-laterally, worsening renal function, worsening heart failure, and potential for further cardiac events.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable at the moment, but close monitoring and management are required due to the presence of multiple comorbidities and recent cardiac events."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous left circumflex artery (LCx) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and diastolic dysfunction. He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and had a complication during catheterization with acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) resulting in ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient underwent revascularization and is now extubated.

The patient has recurrent chest pain with dynamic ST depression infero-laterally. He continues on aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel (Plavix), and heparin drip due to ongoing pain and dynamic ECG changes. A plan for repeat catheterization to treat the LCx lesion has been made. The patient will receive pre-cath hydration and mucomyst. Other medications include metoprolol, statin, and nitroglycerin.

The patient's medical complications include cardiac arrest/shock due to VF secondary to acute LAD occlusion, aortic stenosis with chronic diastolic heart failure, rhythm instability currently in sinus rhythm, renal insufficiency with rising creatinine post-arrest, hypertension (inactive issue), hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and femoral nerve palsy. The patient's access lines include a peripheral intravenous line (PIV)"
