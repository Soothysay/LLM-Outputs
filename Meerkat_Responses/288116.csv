 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   88 yo M with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock
   shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder CA.
   #. Resp Failure: Pt has ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory
   response from either sepsis or a systemic rxn to BCG as below.
   Curently Vt at 8cc/kg, will transition to 7cc/kg; continue PEEP at 10
   as this improved his prolonged expiratory phase.  ecrease FiO2 to 0.5
   from 0.6 given last ABG.  No plan to wean currently given his high
   pressor dependence and tenous clinical status.
   .
   #. Septic Shock/ Urosepsis/ BCG rxn: Pt
s hx of repeat septic
   physiology after BCG treatment x 2 is suggestive of either repeat
   seeding from a urinary source or repeat BCG reaction.  Biliary source
   unlikely as below. Previously, he was treated for presumed urosepsis
   given that enterococcus was growing in his urine during the [**2196-3-20**]
   hospitalization.  Prolonged systemic inflammatory  respponse To BCG has
   been described and fit with pt
s presentation: increased severity of
   second episode would be c/w sensitization during first dose.
   -- Given his possible hx of enterococcal urosepsis, will continue
   ampicillin/sulbactam (d1=[**6-4**]) and levoflox (d1=[**6-4**]) for double  GN
   coverage; urosepsis still most likely cause
   -- Levoflox has added benefit of also treating  m.bovis which sometimes
   acts as a pathogen s/p intravesicular BCG
   -- Vancomycin for Gram + covg given multiple line placed at OSH and
   foreign body insetion during cystoscopy
   -- continue aggressive volume repletion with <D5W+3AMP BICARB> despite
   normal CVP, Hct still suggests hemoconcentration and third spacing
   -- consult ID regarding mgt of possible BCG role in his presentation
   and specifically whether there would be a role for targeted Abx therapy
   against m.bovis, activated APC, and indications/contraindications for
   steroids
   -- echo as voltages on EKG progressively low and heart sounds distatnt,
   need to r/o effusion
   .
   # Renal Failure:  Secondary to septis. GFR continues to fall, UOP
   minimal overnight
   -- Dosing Vanco / levo renally, with vanco trough to be checked on [**6-6**]
   -- urine lytes pending
   -- attempt to increase UOP with fluids
   --consult renal as he may require CVVH soon
   .
   #. Transaminitis, elevated Bili: Seen by ERCP b/c initial concern at
   OSH over LFTs. Transaminitis on the lower end of what would be expected
   for shock liver. Dbili>Indirect suggestive of cholestasis, but
   margianlly elevated AlkP and lack of stones or biliary dilation on US,
   argue strongly that source if not biliary.  Liver failure likely [**2-22**]
   shock.
   n        ERCP will not be pursued, monitor LFTs and bili
   n        Coagulopathy and low fibrinogen likely secondary to liver
   failure and not necessarily indicative of DIC, nevertheless, wil
   monitor DIC  labs
   .
   #. Transient Neutropenia at OSH: fits with severe sepsis.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Dr [**Known lastname 5999**] is still pressor depedent although FiO2/ PEEP needs have not
   worsened. He remains well sedated on the ventilator with minimal urine
   output. He has developed worsening jaundice. His belly is soft but
   there is ecchymosis around the ankles.
   Exam notable for Tm of 99.8 BP 137/55 HR 74 RR with sats of 97% on 50%/
   10 PEEP. PPV is less than 10
   Labs notable for WBC  20.2K, HCT 39 , K+ 4.9 , C 3.4r , lactate of 5.1.
   LFTS have shown decreasing transaminitis but rising bilirubin. CXR with
   bilateral effusions and cardiomegaly , EKG is low voltage but with no
   ischemic change .
   The concern regarding severe SIRS from BCG or disseminated
   mycobacterial infection ( live attenuated strain) with multiorgan
   failure persist. He is starting to develop a coagulopathy from sepsis/
   liver failure. His USG does not reveal a dilated GB and I doubt ERCP
   would have much to benefit him.
   Agree with plan to continue aggresive hemodynamic suppport with fluids
   ( HCO3 containing) and wean pressors. Wil d/w ID regarding steroids for
   hemodynamic issues and antibiotic choices. He will need access for CVVH
   soon as his renal function is unlikely to improve on pressors and
   acidosis and volume will become problem[**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) **] remains a full code.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, renal failure, and transaminitis. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has multiple arterial lines. His blood cultures were taken, and an ultrasound of the gallbladder and liver showed thickening of the gallbladder wall but no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilation. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is pressor-dependent with a low urine output. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient's history of repeat septic physiology after BCG treatment suggests a possible ongoing infection. 
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and the need for invasive ventilation indicate the development of ARDS.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, possibly secondary to sepsis.
4. Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which could be related to sepsis or direct hepatotoxicity from the BCG treatment.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's low fibrinogen levels and elevated prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) suggest a bleeding risk due to liver failure and sepsis.
6. Disseminated Mycobacterial In"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient requires invasive ventilation and has undergone arterial line placement, multi-lumen line placement, and blood cultures. Ultrasound imaging of the gallbladder and liver was also performed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/60 to 143/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg and fluid balance indicating an input of 12,913 mL with an output of 222 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and thickened gallbladder wall without intra or extrahepatic biliary dilation. The patient is being treated with vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine infusions. The patient is also receiving antibiotics and other medications.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   88 yo M with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock
   shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder CA.
   #. Resp Failure: Pt has ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory
   response from either sepsis or a systemic rxn to BCG as below.  Will
   attempt to keep Vt at 6cc/kg (540cc); PEEP has been increased to 10 as
   the pt exhibited a prologned expiratory phase.  Keep FiO2 at 0.6
   currently.
   .
   #. Septic Shock/ Urosepsis/ BCG rxn: Pt
s hx of repeat septic
   physiology after BCG treatment x 2 is suggestive of either repeat
   seeding from a urinary source or repeat BCG reaction.  Biliary source
   unlikely as below. Previously, he was treated for presumed urosepsis
   given that enterococcus was growing in his urine during the [**2196-3-20**]
   hospitalization.  Prolonged systemic inflammatory  respponse To BCG has
   been described and fit with pt
s presentation: increased severity of
   second episode would be c/w sensitization during first dose. [Acute
   respiratory failure and septic shock induced by Mycobacterium bovis. A
   rare side effect of intravesical BCG therapy]  Presse Med. [**2193**]
   [**Month (only) **];35(6 Pt 1):980-2.
   -- Given his possible hx of enterococcal urosepsis, will cover with
   ampicillin/sulbactam and levoflox for double  GN coverage; urosepsis
   still most likely cause
   -- Levoflox has added benefit of also treating  m.bovis which sometimes
   acts as a pathogen s/p intravesicular BCG
   -- Vancomycin for Gram + covg given multiple line placed at OSH and
   foreign body insetion during cystoscopy
   -- Discontinue steroids from OSH
   -- Aggressive volume repletion with 3L <D5W+3AMP BICARB> as pt appears
   to be hemoconcentrated (from 3^rd spacing) on admission and urine outpt
   has been minimal since arrival
   # Renal Failure:  Secondary to septis. GFR now 20.
   -- Dosing Vanco / levo renally, with vanco trough to be checked on [**6-6**]
   -- urine lytes
   -- attempt to increase UOP with fluids
   .
   #. Transaminitis, elevated Bili: Seen by ERCP b/c initial concern at
   OSH over LFTs. Transaminitis on the lower end of what would be expected
   for shock liver. Dbili>Indirect suggestive of cholestasis, but
   margianlly elevated AlkP and lack of stones or biliary dilation on US,
   argue strongly that source if not biliary.
   -- repeat LFTs and bilis in AM
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct immediately prior to transfer was 25 and pt given 2
   Units pRBC. Hct on arrival was 40.  Likely low at OSH s/p 12L due to
   dilution. Likewise, Hct=40 likely indicates further extravasation of
   intravascular volume into interstitium [**2-22**] sepsis.
   -- repeat Hct to ensure not spurious value
   .
   #. Transient Neutropenia at OSH: fits with severe sepsis.

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, septic shock, and bladder cancer. He presented with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. 

The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory response from either sepsis or a systemic reaction to BCG. The plan is to keep the tidal volume (Vt) at 6cc/kg and increase the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 10 due to the prolonged expiratory phase. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) will be maintained at 0.6.

The patient also has septic shock/urosepsis/BCG reaction. His previous history of repeat septic physiology after BCG treatment suggests either repeat seeding from a urinary source or repeat BCG reaction. A biliary source is unlikely. He was previously treated for presumed urosepsis given that enterococcus was growing in his urine during the last hospitalization. 

Considering the prolonged systemic inflammatory response to BCG, the presentation fits with the patient's history. He will be covered with ampicillin/sulbactam and levofloxacin for double Gram-negative coverage; urosepsis is still the most likely cause. Levofloxacin also has the added benefit of treating Mycobacterium bovis, which sometimes acts as a pathogen post-in"

   from 0.6 given last ABG.  No plan to wean currently given his high
   pressor dependence and tenous clinical status.

   #. Septic Shock/ Urosepsis/ BCG rxn: Pt
s hx of repeat septic
   physiology after BCG treatment x 2 is suggestive of either repeat
   seeding from a urinary source or repeat BCG reaction.  Biliary source
   unlikely as below. Previously, he was treated for presumed urosepsis
   given that enterococcus was growing in his urine during the [**2196-3-20**]
   hospitalization.  Prolonged systemic inflammatory  respponse To BCG has
   been described and fit with pt
s presentation: increased severity of
   second episode would be c/w sensitization during first dose.
   -- Given his possible hx of enterococcal urosepsis, will continue
   ampicillin/sulbactam (d1=[**6-4**]) and levoflox (d1=[**6-4**]) for double  GN
   coverage; urosepsis still most likely cause
   -- Levoflox has added benefit of also treating  m.bovis which sometimes
   acts as a pathogen s/p intravesicular BCG
   -- Vancomycin for Gram + covg given multiple line placed at OSH and
   foreign body insetion during cystoscopy
   -- continue aggressive volume repletion with <D5W+3AMP BICARB> despite
   normal CVP, Hct still suggests hemoconcentration and third spacing
   -- consult ID regarding mgt of possible BCG role in his presentation
   and specifically whether there would be a role for targeted Abx therapy
   against m.bovis, activated APC, and indications/contraindications for
   steroids

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and septic shock. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and he requires mechanical ventilation and multiple vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient was admitted with acute onset respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The initial assessment indicates that the patient may have ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory response from either sepsis or a systemic reaction to BCG.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with high ventilator dependence and prolonged expiratory phase. There are plans to transition to a lower tidal volume and continue with PEEP at 10 cmH2O. FiO2 will be decreased to 0.5 from 0.6 based on the last ABG results.

The patient also has signs of septic shock/urosepsis/BCG reaction. His history of repeat septic physiology after BCG treatment suggests either repeat seeding from a urinary source or a repeat BCG reaction. Biliary source is unlikely as mentioned in the note. The patient was previously treated for presumed urosepsis given that enterococcus was growing in his urine during the previous hospitalization.

Due to the possible history of enterococcal urosepsis, the patient will continue ampicillin/sulbactam (started on 6-4) and lev"

   There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). Due
   to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot
   be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
   appear normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be

   88 yo M with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock

   #. Resp Failure: Pt has ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory
   response from either sepsis or a systemic rxn to BCG as below.
   Curently Vt at 8cc/kg, will transition to 7cc/kg; continue PEEP at 10
   as this improved his prolonged expiratory phase.  ecrease FiO2 to 0.5
   from 0.6 given last ABG.  No plan to wean currently given his high
   pressor dependence and tenous clinical status.
   .
   #. Septic Shock/ Urosepsis/ BCG rxn: Appreciate ID input.  Currently on
   rifampin + INF + zosyn + vancomycin.
   Pt
s hx of repeat septic physiology after BCG treatment x 2 is
   suggestive of either repeat seeding from a urinary source or repeat BCG
   reaction.  Biliary source unlikely as below. Previously, he was treated
   for presumed urosepsis given that enterococcus was growing in his urine
   during the [**2196-3-20**] hospitalization.  Prolonged systemic
   inflammatory  respponse To BCG has been described and fit with pt
   presentation: increased severity of second episode would be c/w
   sensitization during first dose.
   -- Given his possible hx of enterococcal urosepsis, will continue
   ampicillin/sulbactam (d1=[**6-4**]) and levoflox (d1=[**6-4**]) for double  GN
   coverage; urosepsis still most likely cause
   -- Levoflox has added benefit of also treating  m.bovis which sometimes
   acts as a pathogen s/p intravesicular BCG
   -- Vancomycin for Gram + covg given multiple line placed at OSH and
   foreign body insetion during cystoscopy
   -- continue aggressive volume repletion with <D5W+3AMP BICARB> despite
   normal CVP, Hct still suggests hemoconcentration and third spacing
   -- consult ID regarding mgt of possible BCG role in his presentation
   and specifically whether there would be a role for targeted Abx therapy
   against m.bovis, activated APC, and indications/contraindications for
   steroids
   -- echo as voltages on EKG progressively low and heart sounds distatnt,
   need to r/o effusion

   # Renal Failure:  Secondary to septis. GFR continues to fall, UOP
   minimal overnight
   -- Dosing Vanco / levo renally, with vanco trough to be checked on [**6-6**]
   -- urine lytes pending
   -- attempt to increase UOP with fluids
   --consult renal as he may require CVVH soon
   .
   #. Transaminitis, elevated Bili: Seen by ERCP b/c initial concern at
   OSH over LFTs. Transaminitis on the lower end of what would be expected
   for shock liver. Dbili>Indirect suggestive of cholestasis, but
   margianlly elevated AlkP and lack of stones or biliary dilation on US,

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, septic shock, and bladder cancer. He presented with acute onset respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient's current condition includes ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory response from either sepsis or a systemic reaction to BCG, as well as septic shock/urosepsis/BCG reaction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which is a serious lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy to minimize lung injury. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory parameters is necessary.
2. Septic Shock/Urosepsis/BCG Reaction: The patient is at risk for recurrent septic shock due to the presence of enterococcal bacteria in his urine and the possibility of bacterial seeding from a urinary source or repeat BCG reaction. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential to treat the infection and prevent further complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure secondary to sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary. Renal replacement therapy (CVVH) may be required soon.
4. Transaminitis and Elevated Bili: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating possible liver injury. This could be due"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   88 yo M with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock
   shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer
   .
   #. Septic Shock/ Urosepsis/ BCG rxn: His systemic inflammatory reaction
   may be secondary to a disseminated infection (perhaps BCG) or may be a
   cytokine storm response to the treatment.  The fact that he had a
   similar episode in the past after BCG is consistent with one of these
   etiologies.  Appreciate ID input.  Currently on rifampin + INH to treat
   disseminated mycobacteria as well as zosyn + vancomycin for broac
   coverage.  Also, corticosteroids started yesterday for the inflammatory
   component.  Currently he is likely continuing to 3^rd space, given
   increasing Hct despite clinical volume overload.
   - continue to treat atypical mycobacteria with INH and rifampin
   - continue broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin and zosyn
   - continue hydrocortisone for anti-inflammatory action
   - scrotal US today to evaluate for mycobacterial infection
   - change out OSH line
   - aim for CVP >10

   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory
   response from either sepsis or cytokine storm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have a
   component of volume overload at this point.  Currently tital volume 7
   cc/kg per ARDSnet protocol.  Esophageal balloon as been helpful in
   allowing us to down-titrate PEEP.  ABG still with hypoxia.
   - continue ventilator support with 7 cc/kg tidal volume
   - follow esophageal pressures to guide PEEP
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Currently requiring 2 pressors, improved somewhat from

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with acute respiratory distress and septic shock following BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications including septic shock, acute renal failure, respiratory failure due to ARDS, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of renal function resulting in acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease, progression of DIC leading to bleeding complications or organ dysfunction, and potential cardiovascular complications due to the patient's hypotension and use of vasopressors.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation status, renal function, coagulation profile, and liver function. Timely intervention and management of these complications are crucial for the patient's well-being and to prevent further deterioration."

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   88 yo M with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock
   shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer
   #. Septic Shock/ Urosepsis/ BCG rxn: His systemic inflammatory reaction
   may be secondary to a disseminated infection (perhaps BCG) or may be a
   cytokine storm response to the treatment.  The fact that he had a
   similar episode in the past after BCG is consistent with one of these
   etiologies.  Appreciate ID input.  Currently on rifampin + INH to treat
   disseminated mycobacteria as well as zosyn + vancomycin for broac
   coverage.  Also, corticosteroids started yesterday for the inflammatory
   component.  Currently he is likely continuing to 3^rd space, given
   increasing Hct despite clinical volume overload.
   - continue to treat atypical mycobacteria with INH and rifampin
   - continue broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin and zosyn
   - continue hydrocortisone for anti-inflammatory action
   - scrotal US today to evaluate for mycobacterial infection
   - change out OSH line
   - aim for CVP >10
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory
   response from either sepsis or cytokine storm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have a
   component of volume overload at this point.  Currently tital volume 7
   cc/kg per ARDSnet protocol.  Esophageal balloon as been helpful in
   allowing us to down-titrate PEEP.  ABG still with hypoxia.
   - continue ventilator support with 7 cc/kg tidal volume
   - follow esophageal pressures to guide PEEP
   #. Hypotension:  Currently requiring 2 pressors, improved somewhat from
   3-pressor requirement yesterday.
   - continue levophed and vasopressin
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, creatinine rising. Renal aware and
   planning to place CVVH line this morning.
   - cryo and FFP to improve coagulopathy prior to CVVH line
   - will gently remove fluid  with CVVH as blood pressures tolerate
   # DIC:  he has laboratory evidence of DIC
   - follow q4h DIC labs
   - replete with cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen >100
   - transfuse for Hct >25
   #. Abnormal LFTs:  Bilirubin still rising.  Transaminitis improved. No
   stones or billiard dilation on US, and low suspicion for cholangitis as
   the cause of sepsis.  Discussed with ERCP yesterday and decided not to
   pursue this.
   - re-check direct bilirubin
   - trend LFTs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He is currently intubated and sedated, with facial and neck edema. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, possibly secondary to disseminated infection or cytokine storm response to BCG treatment. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids for the inflammatory component.

The patient also has respiratory failure due to ARDS, which is secondary to systemic inflammatory response from sepsis or cytokine storm. He is receiving ventilator support with 7 cc/kg tidal volume and PEEP adjustments based on esophageal pressures.

Additionally, the patient has hypotension requiring two pressors, renal failure with anuria and rising creatinine levels, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). His liver function tests show abnormal results with rising bilirubin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock/Urosepsis/BCG reaction: The patient's systemic inflammatory reaction may be secondary to a disseminated infection or a cytokine storm response to BCG treatment. It is essential to continue treating atypical mycobacteria with INH and rifampin, broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin and zosyn, and continue hydrocortisone for anti-inflammatory action.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary"

   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer, currently on two
   pressors.
   #. Septic Shock / Urosepsis / BCG reaction: His systemic inflammatory
   reaction may be secondary to a disseminated infection (perhaps BCG) or
   may be a cytokine storm response to the treatment, although duration of
   response point more toward sepsis than pure cytokine storm.  Appreciate
   ID input.  Currently on rifampin + INH to treat disseminated
   mycobacteria as well as piperacillin/tazobactam + vancomycin for broad
   coverage.  Also, corticosteroids started on [**6-5**] for a possible
   inflammatory component.  In terms of overall prognosis, he is neither
   especially improved nor especially worse; hematocrit still rising
   suggestive of ongoing third spacing c/w clinical picture of high degree
   of edema. All cultures negative thus far.
   - Continue to treat atypical mycobacteria with INH and rifampin; one
   dose of pyridoxine given yesterday
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin and zosyn
   - Continue hydrocortisone for anti-inflammatory action particularly
   with consideration of possibility of pure inflammatory response to BCG;
   value in sepsis is controversial but if useful, would be useful in
   severe cases like this one
   - Scrotal US suggests phlegmon vs tumor; will touch base with urology
   re: drainage and culture
   - Change out OSH line today if possible (not done yesterday); likely
   not the most significant of his problems but could contribute
   - Aim for CVP >10, follow abdominal/bladder pressures
   - Continue CVVH with fluid removal to try to reduce edema, mobilize
   third space fluid into vascular space if possible, however, still
   running positive at this point
   - Elevated abdominal pressures, will follow this; third space effect vs
   abdominal process; surgery has seen the patient, and in conjunction
   with family, have decided not to pursue imaging or surgical
   intervention
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory
   response from either sepsis or cytokine storm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have a
   component of volume overload at this point.  Currently tidal volume
   approx 7 cc/kg per ARDSnet protocol.  Esophageal balloon helpful in
   allowing us to titrate PEEP.  ABG still with hypoxia, although improved
   with increasing PEEP to 12.
   - Continue ventilator support with 7 cc/kg tidal volume
   - Follow esophageal pressures to guide PEEP
   #. Hypotension:  Currently requiring 2 pressors, improved somewhat from
   3-pressor requirement yesterday.
   - Continue norepinephrine and vasopressin
   - Wean norepinephrine as tolerated
   - Replace A-line if possible today
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, creatinine rising. CVVH line
   placed; CVVH is ongoing, started last night; not yet running negative.
   - Will gently remove fluid  with CVVH as blood pressures tolerate
   # DIC:  he has laboratory evidence of DIC
   - Follow q4h DIC labs
   - Replete with cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen >100
   - Transfuse for Hct >25
   - Transfuse platelets > 50 for a procedure
   #. Abnormal LFTs:  Bilirubin still rising.  Transaminitis improved. No
   stones or billiard dilation on US, and low suspicion for cholangitis as
   the cause of sepsis.  Discussed with ERCP on [**6-5**] and decided not to
   pursue for now (continue to follow)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He is currently on two pressors and has systemic inflammatory reactions that may be secondary to disseminated infection or a cytokine storm response to treatment. The patient's prognosis is not improving significantly, with ongoing third spacing and high edema. All cultures remain negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Urosepsis/BCG reaction: The patient's systemic inflammatory reaction may be due to a disseminated infection (possibly BCG) or a cytokine storm response to treatment. He is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, antitubercular medications, and corticosteroids for an inflammatory response.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) secondary to a systemic inflammatory response from either sepsis or a cytokine storm. He requires ventilator support with a low tidal volume and careful monitoring of esophageal pressures to guide PEEP adjustments.

3. Hypotension: The patient is currently hypotensive and requires two pressors to maintain blood pressure. The pressors will be weaned as tolerated, and efforts will be made to replace the arterial line if possible.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric with rising creatinine levels, indicating renal failure. CVVH (Continuous Venous Hem"

   #. Septic Shock/ Urosepsis/ BCG rxn: His systemic inflammatory reaction
   may be secondary to a disseminated infection (perhaps BCG) or may be a
   cytokine storm response to the treatment.  The fact that he had a
   similar episode in the past after BCG is consistent with one of these
   etiologies.  Appreciate ID input.  Currently on rifampin + INH to treat
   disseminated mycobacteria as well as zosyn + vancomycin for broad
   coverage.  Also, corticosteroids started two days ago now for the
   inflammatory component.  In terms of overall prognosis, he is neither
   especially improved nor especially worse; Hct still rising suggestive
   of ongoing third spacing c/w clinical picture of high degree of edema.
   At this point if he does not begin to improve over the next 24 hours it
   is reasonable to think that his prognosis becomes increasingly dismal.
   All cultures negative thus far.

   - aim for CVP >10
   - attempt CVVH to try to reduce edema, mobilize third space fluid into
   vascular space if possible, however, still running positive at this
   point
   - has had elevated abdominal pressures, will follow this; third space
   effect vs abdominal process; discuss risks of CT contrast with renal

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He has a history of a similar episode in the past after BCG treatment. The patient is currently on multiple medications including rifampin, INH, zosyn, and vancomycin to treat disseminated mycobacteria and provide broad-spectrum coverage. Corticosteroids have also been started for the inflammatory component. His prognosis is uncertain, and if he does not improve within the next 24 hours, it may indicate a worsening prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Urosepsis/BCG reaction: The patient's systemic inflammatory reaction may be secondary to a disseminated infection (possibly due to BCG) or a cytokine storm response to the treatment. There is a need for ongoing treatment for atypical mycobacteria and broad-spectrum coverage.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to a systemic inflammatory response from either sepsis or cytokine storm. He is currently on ventilator support with a low tidal volume approach, and esophageal balloon monitoring is being used to guide PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) settings.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires two pressors (levophed and vasopressin) to maintain blood pressure. Weaning of levophed and replacement of arterial line are"

","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and septic shock. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and high heart rate. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. The patient's oxygenation is adequate, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 158. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances, including low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with elevated creatinine and urea levels. 

Imaging reveals hypoechoic nodules in the upper pole of the right testicle, which may be suggestive of a tumor or phlegmon, along with bilateral hydroceles. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ systems. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, further deterioration of renal function, development of new infections, and cardiovascular instability."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of acute onset respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, respiratory failure (ARDS), hypotension, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on ventilator support due to ARDS. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient is being treated with norepinephrine and vasopressin to maintain blood pressure. There is a risk of cardiovascular collapse if the pressors are not effective or if there is a complication such as a myocardial infarction.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is currently anuric (not producing urine) with improving creatinine levels. There is a risk of further renal deterioration and the need for ongoing renal replacement therapy.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has laboratory evidence of DIC, characterized by low platelets, prolonged PTT, and elevated D-dimer levels. There is a risk of bleeding complications if the coagulopathy worsens.

5. Abnormal Liver Function Tests: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to sepsis, medications ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer, who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including septic shock, urosepsis, BCG reaction, respiratory failure due to ARDS, hypotension, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 7 cc/kg. Arterial and central venous lines have been placed, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy via continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of DIC, with low platelets, elevated D-dimer levels, and decreased fibrinogen. His renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Liver function tests are also abnormal, but improving. Imaging studies reveal thickening and edema in the gallbladder wall, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis or intra- or extra-hepatic bil. ductal dilatation.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently in the ICU for continued management of his critical conditions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a male with a history of bladder cancer who is currently in the ICU due to septic/inflammatory physiology after undergoing BCG treatment. The patient's condition has led to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and septic shock. He is on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines placed for treatment, including arterial, multi-lumen, dialysis catheter, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate) after discussion with the family. The patient's vital signs are within acceptable ranges, but he remains sedated and unable to provide history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is experiencing severe lung injury, leading to impaired oxygenation and ventilation. This can result in hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys may be affected by the underlying condition or due to decreased perfusion caused by septic shock. This can lead to oliguria, electrolyte imbalances, and the accumulation of waste products in the blood.
3. Septic Shock: The patient is at risk of further deterioration due to systemic inflammation and infection. This can lead to hemodynamic instability, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and potentially death if"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, urosepsis, and disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure (ARDS), hypotension, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS. Continued ventilator support and close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure. Frequent monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic parameters is crucial.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is currently anuric, indicating a lack of urine output. Ongoing monitoring of renal function and daily weight measurements are necessary. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being utilized to manage renal failure.
4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient shows laboratory evidence of DIC, characterized by low platelets, prolonged PTT, and elevated D-dimer levels. Close monitoring of coag"

   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.
   #. Septic Shock / Urosepsis / BCG reaction ?disseminated M. bovis: The
   patient remains hypotensive requiring Norepinephrine and Vasopressin
   albeit in lower doses than the day prior.  Our goal is to maximize CVVH
   fluid removal rather than wean pressors.  The patient
s WBC is again
   elevated with low grade temperatures concerning for fever given the
   hypothermic effect of CVVH.
   - Continue Norepi & Vasopressin as necessary to tolerate CVVH
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV with ongoing corticosteroids to treat
   disseminated ? M. Bovis
   - Zosyn/ Vanc broad spectrum coverage
   - Continue CVVH
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to sepsis
   - Continue ventilator support, PRVC mode.
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, creatinine stable at 1.9. CVVH
   ongoing with goal -1.2 L today.
   # DIC:  Currently resolved after an episode of hypertension/bradycardia
   during cryoprecipitate infusion.
   - Q12 Hct, Fibrinogen, Coags
   - Replete with cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen >100
   - Transfuse for Hct >25
   - Transfuse platelets > 50 for a procedure

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male who was admitted with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

1. Septic Shock/Urosepsis/BCG reaction: The patient remains hypotensive and requires vasopressor support. There is a concern for disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including rifampin and levofloxacin, as well as corticosteroids.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to sepsis and requires ventilator support in PRVC mode.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric with a creatinine level of 1.9. Continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) is ongoing, aiming to remove 1.2 liters of fluid today.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient had an episode of hypertension/bradycardia during cryoprecipitate infusion, which suggests DIC. Coagulation studies are being monitored, and the patient is being transfused with cryoprecipitate and platelets as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He remains hypotensive and requires vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, urosepsis, and disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection. The treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, rifampin, levofloxacin, and corticosteroids to target the disseminated infection. The patient also has respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis and is on ventilator support. Renal failure is present, with anuria and stable creatinine levels. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is ongoing. There was an episode of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that has since resolved. Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated but resolving. The patient's condition requires ICU care, including nutritional support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and will be managed in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient is currently on vasopressin and norepinephrine for septic shock. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin and rifampin have been initiated to treat disseminated Mycobacterium bovis. The patient also received corticosteroids, which were continued today. He is experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS and requires ventilator support. The patient has renal failure, as evidenced by anuria and stable creatinine levels of 1.2. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated. There are laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with low platelets. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated but resolving. He has abnormal blood glucose levels and requires glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines including a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently admitted to the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.
   #. Septic Shock / Urosepsis / BCG reaction ?disseminated M. bovis: The
   patient remains normotensive on Norepinephrine and Vasopressin albeit
   in lower doses than the day prior.  Our goal is to maximize CVVH fluid
   removal rather than wean pressors.  The patient
s WBC is again elevated
   with low grade temperatures concerning for fever given the hypothermic
   effect of CVVH.
   - Continue Norepi, stop Vasopressin as necessary to tolerate CVVH
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV with ongoing corticosteroids to treat
   disseminated ? M. Bovis
   - Zosyn/ Vanc broad spectrum coverage until cultures return tomorrow
   (also 7 day course completed)
   - Continue CVVH, see Lines below
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to sepsis.  Barriers to
   extubation: ARDS, Pulmonary Edema from significant volume overload
   - Continue ventilator support, PRVC mode.
   #. Afib:  The patient
s amiodarone was stopped overnight due to
   bradycardia.  He is in rate controlled afib at this time.  Will start
   beta blocker once pressors off.
   # Leukocytosis:  The patient has an elevated WBC count.  High concern
   for L OSH line infection, CVVH line infection, uncontroled
   hypersensitivity.
   - Resite lines in IR today pending family consent.
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, creatinine stable at 1.6. CVVH
   ongoing with goal -1.2 L today.   The patient will require a new line
   to be placed in IR as his current CVVH line is not 100% functional and
   repeated stopping of the machine results in volume increase.
   # DIC:  Currently resolved after an episode of hypertension/bradycardia
   during cryoprecipitate infusion.
   - Q12 Hct, Fibrinogen, Coags
   - Replete with cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen >100
   - Transfuse for Hct >25
   - Transfuse platelets > 50 for a procedure
   #. Abnormal LFTs:  Elevated but resolving. Ddx includes sepsis, INH.
   Case reports of granulomatous hepatitis with m bovis but no e/o of this
   best we can tell.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress and septic shock following BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration), and multiple medications. The patient has several medical complications including septic shock, respiratory failure with ARDS, atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, renal failure, DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Urosepsis/BCG Reaction: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer suggests a possible reaction to the BCG. This could be due to disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection.
2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's worsening bilateral fluffy infiltrates on CXR and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate the development of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Pulmonary edema due to volume overload may also be contributing to respiratory failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's amiodarone was stopped due to bradycardia, resulting in rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. A beta-blocker will be started once the patient's pressors are off.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count raises concern for line infections (LOSH), CVV"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute onset respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions.

1. Septic Shock/Urosepsis/BCG reaction: The patient remains hypotensive and requires the use of Norepinephrine and Vasopressin to maintain blood pressure. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and low-grade temperatures indicate a possible ongoing infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to sepsis. He is receiving ventilator support in PRVC mode.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric (not producing urine), and his creatinine levels are stable at 1.9. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) is ongoing with a goal of removing 1.2 liters of fluid today.

4. Disseminated M. bovis: The patient is suspected to have disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection, which is a rare complication of BCG vaccination. Treatment includes Rifampin and Levofloxacin IV, along with ongoing corticosteroids.

5. DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation): The patient had an episode of hypertension/bradycardia during cryoprecipitate infusion, which has since resolved."

   - Continue ventilator support, PRVC mode.
   #. Afib:  The patient
s amiodarone was stopped overnight due to
   bradycardia.  He is in rate controlled afib at this time.  Will start
   beta blocker once pressors off.
   # Leukocytosis:  The patient has an elevated WBC count.  High concern
   for L OSH line infection, CVVH line infection, uncontroled
   hypersensitivity.
   - Resite lines in IR today pending family consent.
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, creatinine stable at 1.6. CVVH
   ongoing with goal -1.2 L today.   The patient will require a new line
   to be placed in IR as his current CVVH line is not 100% functional and
   repeated stopping of the machine results in volume increase.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation (AFIB), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, septic shock, and disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection. The patient remains hypotensive and requires continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with goal fluid removal of -1.2 L today. The patient also has pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions as seen on chest radiograph. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Line infections: The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, which increases the risk of line infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or line-associated thrombosis.

2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. This increases the risk of further deterioration in kidney function and potential need for renal replacement therapy.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

4. Septic shock: The patient is at risk of recurrent septic shock due to ongoing infection and immunosuppression from the BCG treatment.

5. Disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection: The patient has been started on rifampin and levofloxacin to treat the disseminated infection. However, there is a risk of treatment failure or development of drug resistance.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in rate-controlled AFIB, but there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias and potential embolic events.

7. Abnormal liver function tests: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could indicate hepatic injury due to sepsis or potential adverse effects of medications.

8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT formation.

9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of stress-induced gastric ulcers due to critical illness and potential use of corticosteroids.

10. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs).

The patient requires careful monitoring and management of these potential complications to improve outcomes."

   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.  Currently with ARDS
   but improving.
   #. Septic Shock / Urosepsis / BCG reaction ?disseminated M. bovis:
   Slow improvement but remains tenuous. Most likely this is a systemic
   inflammatory reaction.  All culutures have been negative, although
   atypical mycobacteria would be expected to grow slowly. He is doing
   better and is now off pressors except for low-dose levophed.  He is
   total body overloaded despite being intra-vascularly depleted with low
   CVP.  Our goal is to maximize CVVH fluid removal even if that means
   keeping on low-dose levophed.  WBC continues to climb, which may be
   secondary to steroids but also concerning for untreated infection
   - Continue levophed as necessary to tolerate CVVH
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV with ongoing corticosteroids to treat
   disseminated ? M. Bovis
   - continue high-dose steroids to treat inflammatory component; will
   need 2-3 weeks; continue to discuss with ID
   - stop Zosyn/ Vanc today (completed 7-day course for undefined possible
   bacterial infection)
   - Continue CVVH
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to sepsis.  Barriers to
   extubation include ARDS, and Pulmonary Edema from significant volume
   overload.  Last ABG with adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
   - Continue ventilator support with ARDSnet low TV and current settings
   for now.
   #. Afib:  Initially required amiodarone gtt.  He is in rate controlled
   afib at this time.  Will start beta blocker once pressors off.
   # Leukocytosis:  Rising WBC count.   Afebrile for the past 24 hours,
   but can not trust fevers given CVVH and steroids.  High concern for OSH
   line infection or CVVH line infection, vs uncontroled
   hypersensitivity.  Both lines were re-sited  yesterday although femoral
   HD line still in place.  He is also high-risk for VAP although no
   change in CXR or secretions.
   - continue to monitor
   - pull femoral line
   - c diff x 3
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, CVVH ongoing .  New CVVH line
   placed yesterday.  Volume overloaded despite intravascularly dry with
   low CVP.
   - continue CVVH
   - goal net even to slightly negative today
   # DIC:  Continues to be thrombocytopenic, likely contribution from
   low-level DIC.  Received 1 unit platelets yesterday with appropriate
   bump.  Fibrinogen has been stable >100 after an episode of
   hypertension/bradycardia during cryoprecipitate infusion.
   - Q12 Hct, Fibrinogen, Coags
   - Replete with cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen >100

   the past few days.  LDH and alk phos basically stable.   Transaminitis
   improving.  Ddx includes sepsis, INH. Case reports of granulomatous
   hepatitis with m bovis but no e/o of this best we can tell.  Discused

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, septic shock, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), leukocytosis, disseminated infection (possibly Mycobacterium bovis), and pulmonary edema. The patient received BCG treatment for bladder cancer and subsequently developed acute respiratory distress and septic shock. He is currently on mechanical ventilation support due to ARDS and has been receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to renal failure. The patient's condition remains tenuous, and there are concerns about potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central venous catheter-related infection, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of any signs of infection will be crucial.
2. Central venous catheter-related infection: The patient has multiple central lines, which increases the risk of infection. Frequent assessment of the lines and appropriate management, including re-siting if necessary, should be considered.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other risk factors may predispose the patient to DVT. Prophylactic measures such as pneumatic compression devices should be utilized to prevent DVT.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He is currently diagnosed with ARDS but showing slow improvement. The patient remains in critical condition with multiple medical complications including septic shock, respiratory failure, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock / Urosepsis / BCG reaction: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment suggests a possible reaction to the treatment. There is a concern for disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection, which requires ongoing treatment with rifampin, levofloxacin, and corticosteroids.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to sepsis, making extubation challenging due to ongoing pulmonary edema from volume overload. Pressure support and assisted ventilation are being considered to improve oxygenation and correct alkalosis.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is currently anuric (no urine output) with ongoing CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) to manage fluid overload and remove waste products. Daily fluid removal goals of 2L are set for CVVH.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient initially required amiodarone for rate control in atrial fibrillation."

The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He was diagnosed with ARDS and septic shock, and is currently improving but remains tenuous. The patient has multiple medical complications including disseminated M. bovis infection, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, DIC, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated M. bovis infection: The patient is being treated with rifampin and levofloxacin IV, along with ongoing corticosteroids to address this infection.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can occur as a complication of sepsis. Barriers to extubation include ARDS and pulmonary edema due to significant volume overload.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric (no urine output) and is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) to manage renal failure.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient initially required amiodarone for rate control, but is currently in rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. Beta-blocker"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He is currently diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) but showing improvement daily. The patient has multiple medical complications including septic shock, urosepsis, possible disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection, respiratory failure due to ARDS, renal failure with anuria, atrial fibrillation, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock/Urosepsis/BCG Reaction: The patient initially presented with septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. It is important to continue aggressive management with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV) and ongoing corticosteroids to treat disseminated M. bovis infection. Monitoring for any signs of ongoing infection or inflammatory response is crucial.

2. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS. Barriers to extubation include ARDS and pulmonary edema from significant volume overload. A trial of pressure support ventilation should be considered, along with adjusting the ventilator settings to decrease the respiratory rate and correct metabolic alkalosis. 

3. Renal Failure: The patient is currently anuric, indicating no urine output. Continuous"

   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.  Currently with ARDS
   but improving daily.
   #. Septic Shock / Urosepsis / BCG reaction ?disseminated M. bovis:
   Slow improvement but remains tenuous. Systemic inflammatory reaction
   from BCG vs. smoldering mycobacterial infection.  No longer on pressors
   since midnight.  WBC count resolving after femoral line removal.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV with ongoing corticosteroids to treat
   disseminated ? M. Bovis
   - continue high-dose steroids to treat inflammatory component; will
   need 2-3 weeks; continue to discuss with ID
   - F/U C. diff with any stools
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to sepsis.  Barriers to
   extubation include ARDS and Pulmonary Edema from significant volume
   overload.  Last ABG with adequate oxygenation and hyperventilation.
   - Trial of pressure support this AM, otherwise consider AC or PRVC to
   decrease rate and correct alkalosis.
   - Continue CVVH with goal 2L fluid removal daily
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, CVVH ongoing.  New CVVH line
   placed.  Volume overloaded despite intravascularly dry with low CVP.
   - Continue CVVH with goal 2L fluid removal daily
   - Discuss conversion to HD with renal
   #. Afib:  Initially required amiodarone gtt.  He is in rate controlled
   afib at this time.
   # DIC:  Stable Platelet and Fibrinogen count. DIC likely from ongoing
   inflammatory response, ? infection, possible contribution from CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He has been diagnosed with ARDS and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection, which is being treated with rifampin and levofloxacin. He is also receiving high-dose corticosteroids to manage inflammation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS is a significant barrier to extubation, and he requires continued ventilatory support. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and requires CVVH for fluid removal and renal support. There is a risk of ongoing volume overload and potential need for conversion to hemodialysis.
3. Disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection: The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics for this infection; however, there is a risk of treatment failure or development of drug resistance.
4. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): Although the patient's platelet and fibrinogen levels are stable, there is a risk of ongoing coagulopathy and bleeding complications.
5. Abnormal LFTs: The patient's transaminitis is improving, but there is a risk of further liver dysfunction.
6. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with"

The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been on various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and rifampin. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for transient hypotension after stopping CVVH.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 7,860 mL and total output of 9,531 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,671 mL. The patient's urine output is 23 mL, NG output is 10 mL, and stool output is not mentioned. The patient's blood products usage is 428 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a set volume of 500 mL, pressure support of 5 cmH2O, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pH 7.53, PaCO2 of 29, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 207.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 14.2 to 19.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 22.3 to 26.5%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 55 to 64 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 1.0 to 1.9 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 90 to 149 mg/dL, and other lab values including calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), phosphate (PO4), and liver enzymes.

The patient's imaging includes a chest X-ray (CXR) showing an unchanged image from prior, with an endotracheal tube in place and bilateral diffuse opacity.

The patient's microbiology results for blood culture drawn from the central line are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines (arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and comments on communication, code status, and disposition.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment. He is currently ventilator-dependent but showing signs of improvement with fluid removal. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis. He is at risk for further respiratory complications due to prolonged ventilation and pulmonary edema from significant volume overload.

2. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs as a result of a severe infection. There is a risk of recurrent or persistent sepsis if the underlying infection is not adequately treated.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is currently anuric (not producing urine) and has acute renal failure. This condition requires immediate attention and management through dialysis to prevent further kidney damage and removal of waste products from the body.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has DIC, which is a condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body's small blood vessels. This can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and increase the risk of bleeding complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/62mmHg to 157/95mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The platelet count is decreased, and there are abnormalities in coagulation tests such as prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). Imaging studies have not been performed yet. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and blood pressure management drugs. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status and is currently in the ICU for further management.

   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.  Continues to be
   ventilator dependent but shows signs of improvement with fluid removal.
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to sepsis.  Stable overnight on
   PRVC. Barriers to extubation include ARDS and Pulmonary Edema from
   significant volume overload, long term sedation.  The patient is ~27L
   positive since admission (minus large insensible losses) and will
   require significant diuresis before he can be safely extubated.  Did
   not received HD yesterday.
   - Continue PRVC and focus on high volume fluid removal via
   HD/Ultrafiltration
   #. BCG Reaction: Still unclear if his primary process is sepsis,
   urosepsis a systemic hypersensitivity from BCG or a smoldering M. Bovis
   infection.  His hypotension, WBC and fevers have resolved.  C. diff
   negative x3.  His overall picture is improving
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing
   - Allergy Recommendations: Rapid steroid taper
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, transitioned to HD. Volume
   overloaded despite intravascular volume depletion.  4L every other day
   will not be successful in removing fluid.  The patient will require
   ultrafiltration in between HD session.
   - Continue HD with minimum 4L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   # DIC:  Stable Platelet and Fibrinogen count. Currently resolved but
   treading the line of DIC likely from ongoing inflammatory response.

","The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He continues to be ventilator-dependent but shows signs of improvement with fluid removal.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis, septic shock, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and impaired skin integrity.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition that affects the lungs. It can lead to further respiratory distress, oxygenation problems, and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Septic Shock: The patient is at risk of experiencing recurrent septic shock, especially if there is a persistent source of infection or if his immune system remains compromised. This can result in hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to a buildup of waste products and fluid imbalance in the body. This can further complicate his overall health status and increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and acid-base disturbances.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): DIC is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. It can lead to bleeding complications and organ dysfunction if not"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He is currently ventilator-dependent but showing signs of improvement with fluid removal. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis. This is a life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and management.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and requires hemodialysis (HD) for fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance. This is a serious complication that requires careful monitoring of renal function and fluid balance.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has resolved DIC, but it can recur if not closely monitored. Regular coagulation studies should be done to assess the patient's clotting status.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has edematous skin and may be at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and poor tissue perfusion.
5. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a potentially fatal condition caused by severe infection and inadequate blood flow to vital organs.
6. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, indicating possible liver dysfunction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute onset respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient has been ventilator-dependent but shows signs of improvement with fluid removal. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to sepsis. This condition is characterized by inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange. The patient's positive fluid balance and pulmonary edema indicate a need for significant diuresis before he can be safely extubated.

2. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection and inadequate blood flow to organs. Although the patient's hypotension, WBC, and fevers have resolved, there is a possibility of recurrence if infection persists.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is currently anuric (not producing urine) and has renal failure. Anuria indicates a possible acute kidney injury, which can be caused by severe dehydration, infection, or other factors. The patient requires hemodialysis (HD) to remove excess fluid and waste products from the body.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient is at risk for DIC, a condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. It can lead to both excessive clot"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient continues to be ventilator-dependent but shows signs of improvement with fluid removal.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to an inflammatory response. Barriers to extubation include ARDS and pulmonary edema from significant volume overload, as well as long-term sedation. 

2. Septic Shock: The patient initially experienced septic shock, which has since improved. It is unclear whether the inciting event was sepsis or a hypersensitivity reaction from the BCG treatment. The patient is currently on empiric treatment with both antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and has transitioned to hemodialysis (HD). The patient is volume overloaded despite intravascular volume depletion. Ultrafiltration will be required in between HD sessions to remove excess fluid.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient appears to have resolved DIC, with no further monitoring or factor repletion required.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bedrest and immobility. This increases the risk of pressure ulcers and skin infections.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute onset respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient remains ventilator-dependent but shows signs of improvement with fluid removal. He is currently being treated for several conditions including respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to an inflammatory response. He is on assisted ventilation and barriers to extubation include ARDS and pulmonary edema from significant volume overload, long-term sedation. There is a plan to continue fluid removal via hemodialysis (HD) and ultrafiltration (UF), wean sedation, and trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) to prepare for extubation.

2. BCG Reaction: The patient's hypotension, white blood cell count, and fevers have resolved. He is currently on empiric treatment with both antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity. There is concern about the side effects of the high-dose, relatively long steroid course including steroid myopathy. The plan is to increase the rapidity of steroid taper and consider prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.  Continues to be
   ventilator dependent because of volume overload.
   #. Respiratory Failure:   Initially this was ARDS secondary to
   inflammatory response.  Barriers to extubation currently include
   pulmonary edema most prominently.  He was intermittently apneic during
   PSV trial yesterday.  Currently getting HD every other day and UF on
   the days in between with goal 4 L fluid removal daily (although by some
   error this fluid debt was not recorded in Metavision yesterday).
   - continue AC ventilation
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF
   - will re-try lightening sedation and moving toward PSV in the upcoming
   days
   .
   #. BCG Reaction: It remains unclear whether the inciting event was
   sepsis or a hypersensitivity from BCG.  His hypotension, WBC and fevers
   have resolved.  He is currently on empiric treatment with both
   antibiotics for possible infection and  a steroid taper for possible
   hypersensitivity.  Steroids were decreased yesterday, with plans for a
   fast taper to 20 mg.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection.
   - hydrocortisone taper:  60 mg IV q8h, then 40 mg Ivq8h x 2 days, then
   20 mg for a prolonged time
   - start PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, transitioned to HD. Volume
   overloaded despite intravascular volume depletion.  4L every other day
   will not be successful in removing fluid.  The patient will require
   ultrafiltration in between HD session.
   - Continue HD with minimum 4L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   - [**Last Name (un) 6304**] line today
   .
   #. Falling WBC:  stable today after falling from a peak of 29.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypertension:  He remains hypertensive despite starting low-dose
   hydralazine.
   -  increase hydralazine to 20 mg q8h
   .
   # DIC:  seems to have resolved.  No factor repletion required x days.
   - no need to monitor further
   .
   #. Shock Liver:  LFTs improving daily.  LDH elevation yesterday likely
   secondary to hemolysis.
   - trend LFTs daily

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient continues to be ventilator-dependent due to volume overload. The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and impaired skin integrity. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS secondary to an inflammatory response. Barriers to extubation include pulmonary edema most prominently. The patient was intermittently apneic during a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday. Currently, the patient is receiving hemodialysis (HD) every other day and ultrafiltration on the days in between with a goal of removing 4 liters of fluid daily. The plan is to continue assisted ventilation, continue fluid removal via HD/UF, and reattempt lightening sedation and moving towards PSV in the upcoming days.

2. BCG Reaction: It is unclear whether the inciting event was sepsis or a hypersensitivity reaction from BCG. The patient's hypotension, white blood cell count, and fevers have resolved. The patient is currently on empiric treatment with both antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity. Steroids were decreased yesterday, with plans for a fast taper to 20 mg. Rifampin and Levofloxacin IV are ongoing for possible atypical my"

   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.  Continues to be
   ventilator dependent but shows signs of improvement with fluid removal.
   #. Respiratory Failure:   ARDS secondary to inflammatory response.  Now
   on AC.  ET tube 2.5 cm from carina today. Barriers to extubation
   include ARDS and pulmonary edema from significant volume overload, long
   term sedation.  Currently getting HD every other day and UF on the days
   in between with goal 4 L fluid removal daily (although by some error
   this fluid debt was not recorded in Metavision yesterday).
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF
   - try to wean sedation and trial of PSV
   - pull back ET tube
   .
   #. BCG Reaction: It remains unclear whether the inciting event was
   sepsis or a hypersensitivity from BCG.  His hypotension, WBC and fevers
   have resolved.  He is currently on empiric treatment with both
   antibiotics for possible infection and  a steroid taper for possible
   hypersensitivity.  We are concerned about the side effects of such high
   dose, relatively long steroid  course including steroid myopathy.
   Allergy is following.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection.
   - increase rapidity of steroid taper:  60 mg IV q8h, then 40 mg Ivq8h x
   2 days, then 20 mg for a prolonged time
   - consider PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, transitioned to HD. Volume
   overloaded despite intravascular volume depletion.  4L every other day
   will not be successful in removing fluid.  The patient will require
   ultrafiltration in between HD session.
   - Continue HD with minimum 4L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   .
   #. Falling WBC:  WBC have fallen from a peak of 29.  It is currently
   normal, but ongoing decline is worrisome for a drug reaction.
   - continue to monitor
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute onset respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He continues to be ventilator-dependent but shows signs of improvement with fluid removal. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and impaired skin integrity.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Prolonged ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure and pulmonary edema may prolong the need for mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other complications associated with prolonged intubation.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI, leading to further deterioration in kidney function and the need for dialysis.

3. Sepsis: The patient's initial septic shock could recur if there is a new infection or if the current infection worsens, leading to another episode of septic shock.

4. DIC: Although the patient's DIC seems to have resolved, there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the underlying cause of the initial DIC, such as sepsis or another clotting disorder, is not fully treated or resolved.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, especially given his immobility and prolonged bed"

   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.  Continues to be
   ventilator dependent because of volume overload.
   #. Respiratory Failure:   Initially this was ARDS secondary to
   inflammatory response.  Barriers to extubation currently include
   pulmonary edema most prominently.  He was intermittently apneic during
   PSV trial yesterday.  Currently getting HD every other day and UF on
   the days in between with goal 4 L fluid removal daily (although by some
   error this fluid debt was not recorded in Metavision yesterday).
   - continue AC ventilation
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF
   .
   #. BCG Reaction: It remains unclear whether the inciting event was
   sepsis or a hypersensitivity from BCG.  His hypotension, WBC and fevers
   have resolved.  He is currently on empiric treatment with both
   antibiotics for possible infection and  a steroid taper for possible
   hypersensitivity.  We are concerned about the side effects of such high
   dose, relatively long steroid  course including steroid myopathy.
   Allergy is following.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection.
   - increase rapidity of steroid taper:  60 mg IV q8h, then 40 mg Ivq8h x
   2 days, then 20 mg for a prolonged time
   - consider PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, transitioned to HD. Volume
   overloaded despite intravascular volume depletion.  4L every other day
   will not be successful in removing fluid.  The patient will require
   ultrafiltration in between HD session.
   - Continue HD with minimum 4L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   .
   #. Falling WBC:  WBC have fallen from a peak of 29.  It is currently
   normal, but ongoing decline is worrisome for a drug reaction.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypertension:  After previously being hypotensive, he is currently
   hypertensive.  Per nursing, this is true even when he is not agitated.
   - start hydralazine through NGT with holding parameters
   .
   # DIC:  seems to have resolved.  No factor repletion required x days.
   - no need to monitor further
   .
   #. Shock Liver:  LFTs improving daily, although LDH bumped today (but
   specimen hemolyzed).

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress and septic shock following BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He is currently ventilator-dependent due to volume overload. The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:
1. Respiratory Failure: Continue AC ventilation and continue to remove volume via hemodialysis (HD) and ultrafiltration (UF) with a goal of 4 liters fluid removal daily.
2. BCG Reaction: The patient is on empiric treatment with antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity. The plan is to increase the rapidity of steroid taper and consider PCP prophylaxis.
3. Renal Failure: Continue HD with minimum 4L fluid removal today alternating with ultrafiltration.
4. Falling WBC: Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count.
5. Hypertension: Start hydralazine through nasogastric tube with holding parameters.

   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.  Continues to be
   ventilator dependent because of volume overload which we are
   successfully improving at ~2L daily.
   #. Respiratory Failure:   Initial insult ARDS secondary to the post-BCG
   inflammatory response.  Fluid overload is his primary barrier to
   extubation.  Currently getting HD every other day and UF on the days in
   between with goal 4 L fluid removal daily.
   - continue AC ventilation
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF
   - will re-try lightening sedation and moving toward PSV in the upcoming
   days as he approaches +10L
   #. BCG Reaction: Leukocytosis, fevers resolved, no signs or symptoms of
   any infection.  He is currently on empiric treatment with both
   antibiotics for possible infection and  a steroid taper for possible
   hypersensitivity.  Steroids were decreased yesterday, with plans for a
   fast taper to 20 mg.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection.
   - hydrocortisone taper:  60 mg IV q8h, then 40 mg Ivq8h x 2 days, then
   20 mg for a prolonged time
   - Continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, transitioned to HD. Volume
   overloaded despite intravascular volume depletion.  4L every other day
   will not be successful in removing fluid.  The patient will require
   ultrafiltration in between HD session.
   - Continue HD with minimum 4L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   - tunnelled line postponed until Monday
   # Hypertension:  The patient has developed hypertension to the 190s
   that is responsive to hydralazine.  He continues to have brief periods
   of hypotension from fluid shifting that make long term
   anti-hypertensive therapy difficult. He remains hypertensive despite
   starting low-dose hydralazine.
   -  Continue hydralazine to 20 mg q8h with firm holding parameters (hold
   <SBP 110)
   #. Shock Liver:  LFTs improving daily.
   - trend LFTs daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male who was admitted with acute respiratory distress and septic shock after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He remains ventilator-dependent due to volume overload, which is being successfully improved at a rate of ~2L daily. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely secondary to ARDS caused by the post-BCG inflammatory response. Fluid overload is the main barrier to extubation.

The patient is currently undergoing hemodialysis (HD) every other day and ultrafiltration (UF) on the days in between, with a goal of removing 4L of fluid daily. He is being continuously ventilated using assist-control (AC) mode and is on a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity reaction.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to anuria, and he has been transitioned to HD. He requires ultrafiltration in between HD sessions. The patient's blood pressure has increased to the 190s, which is responsive to hydralazine. His liver function tests are improving daily.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to ARDS caused by the post-BCG inflammatory response. The primary barrier to extubation is fluid overload.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has developed renal failure, leading to anuria"

   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.  Continues to be
   ventilator dependent because of volume overload which we are
   successfully improving at ~2L daily.
   #. Respiratory Failure:   Initial insult ARDS secondary to the post-BCG
   inflammatory response.  Fluid overload is his primary barrier to
   extubation.  Currently getting HD every other day and UF on the days in
   between with goal 4 L fluid removal daily.
   - continue AC ventilation
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF
   - will re-try lightening sedation and moving toward PSV in the upcoming
   days as he approaches +10L
   #. BCG Reaction: Leukocytosis, fevers resolved, no signs or symptoms of
   any infection.  He is currently on empiric treatment with both
   antibiotics for possible infection and  a steroid taper for possible
   hypersensitivity.  Steroids were decreased yesterday, with plans for a
   fast taper to 20 mg.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection.
   - hydrocortisone taper:  60 mg IV q8h, then 40 mg Ivq8h x 2 days, then
   20 mg for a prolonged time
   - Continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   #. Renal Failure:  Currently anuric, transitioned to HD. Volume
   overloaded despite intravascular volume depletion.  4L every other day
   will not be successful in removing fluid.  The patient will require
   ultrafiltration in between HD session.
   - Continue HD with minimum 4L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   - tunnelled line postponed until Monday
   # Hypertension:  The patient has developed hypertension to the 190s
   that is responsive to hydralazine.  He continues to have brief periods
   of hypotension from fluid shifting that make long term
   anti-hypertensive therapy difficult. He remains hypertensive despite
   starting low-dose hydralazine.
   -  Continue hydralazine to 20 mg q8h with firm holding parameters (hold
   <SBP 110)
   #. Shock Liver:  LFTs improving daily.
   - trend LFTs daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 88-year-old male with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.
- He remains ventilator-dependent due to volume overload, which is being successfully improved at approximately 2 liters daily.
- The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure secondary to ARDS caused by the post-BCG inflammatory response, fluid overload, leukocytosis, fevers resolved, no signs or symptoms of infection, renal failure (anuric), and hypertension.
- The patient is receiving empirical antibiotic treatment for possible infection, a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity, hemodialysis (HD) every other day with ultrafiltration in between HD sessions, and hydralazine for hypertension.
- The patient's laboratory results show improving liver function tests (LFTs) and other lab values within normal range.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and his disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to rely on mechanical ventilation due to volume overload, which is a primary barrier to extubation. The ongoing efforts include continued AC ventilation, volume removal via HD/UF, and gradually lightening sedation with the goal of moving toward pressure support ventilation (PSV) in the upcoming days as he approaches +10L.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He remains ventilator-dependent due to volume overload, which is being successfully improved at approximately 2 liters daily. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and impaired skin integrity.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced ARDS secondary to the post-BCG inflammatory response. Fluid overload is the primary barrier to extubation. The patient is receiving hemodialysis (HD) every other day and ultrafiltration on the intervening days with a goal of removing 4 liters of fluid daily. The plan is to continue AC ventilation and continue removing volume via HD/UF. Sedation will be lightened and the patient will be transitioned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) as he approaches a tidal volume of 10 liters.

2. BCG Reaction: The patient showed leukocytosis and fevers, which have now resolved. There are no signs or symptoms of infection. The patient is currently on empiric treatment with antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity. The plan is to decrease the steroid dose yesterday, with plans for a fast taper to 20 mg. Rifampin and Levofloxacin IV will continue for possible atypical mycob"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. He continues to be ventilator dependent due to volume overload, which is being successfully improved at a rate of approximately 2 liters daily. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), impaired skin integrity, hypertension, and liver dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on the ventilator due to fluid overload. Continued efforts should be made to remove excess fluid through hemodialysis (HD) and ultrafiltration (UF) to facilitate extubation.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on alternating HD and UF every other day to manage fluid balance and improve renal function. It is crucial to monitor urine output and adjust the treatment accordingly.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormal coagulation parameters, suggesting DIC. Close monitoring of clotting factors and platelet count is necessary to guide treatment.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has areas of impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infection. Proper wound care and prevention strategies should be implemented to minimize the risk.

5. Hypertension: The patient has developed hypertension, which is currently being managed with hydralazine. Frequent monitoring of"

   #. Respiratory Failure:   Initial insult ARDS secondary to the post-BCG
   inflammatory response.  Fluid overload is his primary barrier to
   extubation.  Currently getting HD every other day and UF on the days in
   between with goal 4 L fluid removal daily
Last two days with better
   (more negative) fluid balance.
   - continue AC ventilation
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF, not available today
   unfortunately due to HD staffing issues
   - will re-try lightening sedation and moving toward PSV in the upcoming
   days as he approaches +10L
   - some urgency to volume to volume removal and extubation given pt
   advanced age and recent steroid exposure
   #. BCG Reaction: Leukocytosis, fevers resolved, no signs or symptoms of
   any infection.  He is currently on empiric treatment with both
   antibiotics for possible infection and  a steroid taper for possible
   hypersensitivity rxn.  Steroid taper has been accelerated.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection; discuss duration with ID
   - hydrocortisone taper:  60 mg IV q8h, then 40 mg Ivq8h x 2 days, then
   20 mg for a prolonged time
   - Continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   #. Renal Failure:  HD and UF alternating QOD.  He is 5L negative over
   the last two days on current schedule of HD/UF.  UOP still very lo, but
   significantly improved from previously.
   - Continue HD with minimum 4L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   - tunnelled line CONVERSION postponed until Monday
   # Hypertension:  The patient has developed hypertension to the 190s
   that is responsive to hydralazine.  He continues to have brief periods
   of hypotension from fluid shifting that make long term
   anti-hypertensive therapy difficult. He remains hypertensive despite
   starting low-dose hydralazine.
   -  stopped hydral as HTN felt to be sedation related. Titrate sedation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The patient continues to be ventilator dependent due to volume overload, which is being successfully improved at approximately 2 liters daily.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to the post-BCG inflammatory response. Fluid overload is the primary barrier to extubation. The plan is to continue AC ventilation and remove volume via hemodialysis (HD) or ultrafiltration (UF), aiming for a goal of 4 liters fluid removal daily.

2. Septic Shock: The patient experienced septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment. Empiric treatment with antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity reaction has been initiated. Rifampin and Levofloxacin IV are ongoing for possible atypical mycobacterial infection, while hydrocortisone taper is being administered.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, requiring hemodialysis (HD) and ultrafiltration (UF) alternating every other day. The patient is 5 liters negative over the last two days on the current schedule of HD/UF, with improved urine output.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient may be at risk"

off HD yesterday over
   nursing considerations, back on UF/HD today.
   - continue AC ventilation; get NIF this PM
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF

   be transitioning to 20mg IV tid of hydrocort tomorrow for one
   week
further slow titration to follow: one reported complication of
   fast tapers in this condition is diffuse mbovis granuloma formation
   (per up-to-date)
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection; need to determine duration
   - hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID X 1 WEEK, and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time
   - Continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   #. Renal Failure:  HD and UF alternating QOD.  He is 5L negative over

   improving daily.
   - Continue HD with minimum 3L fluid removal today alternating with

   # Goals of Care: per last discussion with family, it seems that they
   would not want to pursue trach/peg, making expeditious volume removal
   and subsequent extubation more pressing issues given his risk for

   Assessment and Plan
   88M w acute onset of respiratory distress and septic-like shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer [**2-22**] either
   disseminated M. bovis infection vs cytokine-driven hypersensitivity
   reaction.  Continues to be ventilator dependent because of volume
   overload, slowly improving with HD/UF.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Initial insult ARDS secondary to the post-BCG
   inflammatory response.  Fluid overload is still his primary barrier to
   extubation.  Currently getting HD every other day and UF on the days in
   between with goal 2-3 L fluid removal daily
off HD yesterday over
   nursing considerations, back on UF/HD today.
   - continue AC ventilation; get NIF this PM
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF
   - will re-try lightening sedation and moving toward PSV in the upcoming
   days as he approaches euvolemia
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   # BCG Reaction: Leukocytosis, fevers resolved, no signs or symptoms of
   any infection.  He is currently on empiric treatment with both
   antibiotics for possible infection and  a steroid taper for possible
   hypersensitivity rxn.  Steroid taper has been accelerated and he will
   be transitioning to 20mg IV tid of hydrocort tomorrow for one
   week
further slow titration to follow: one reported complication of
   fast tapers in this condition is diffuse mbovis granuloma formation
   (per up-to-date)
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection; need to determine duration
   - hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID X 1 WEEK, and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time
   - Continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   #. Renal Failure:  HD and UF alternating QOD.  He is 5L negative over
   the last two days on current schedule of HD/UF.  UOP still  low, but
   improving daily.
   - Continue HD with minimum 3L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   - tunnelled line CONVERSION postponed given increase in UOP and
   potential of renal recovery
   # Hypertension:  Stopped hydral as HTN felt to be sedation related.
   Titrate sedation in response to BP as well. Hydral prn if becomes an
   issue with weaning.
   #. Shock Liver:  LFTs improving daily.
   - trend LFTs daily
   # Goals of Care: per last discussion with family, it seems that they
   would not want to pursue trach/peg, making expeditious volume removal
   and subsequent extubation more pressing issues given his risk for
   myopathy (advanced age, high doses of steroids).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic-like shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The possible causes for his condition include disseminated M. bovis infection or a cytokine-driven hypersensitivity reaction. The patient continues to be ventilator dependent due to volume overload, but is slowly improving with hemodialysis (HD) and ultrafiltration (UF).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The initial insult was ARDS secondary to the post-BCG inflammatory response. Fluid overload is still the primary barrier to extubation. The patient is receiving HD every other day and UF on the days in between with a goal of 2-3 L fluid removal daily. He was taken off HD yesterday due to nursing considerations, but is back on UF/HD today.
2. BCG Reaction: Leukocytosis and fevers have resolved, and there are no signs or symptoms of infection. The patient is currently on empiric treatment with antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity reaction. The steroid taper has been accelerated, and he will transition to 20mg IV tid of hydrocortisone tomorrow for one week, followed by further slow titration.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is undergoing HD and UF alternating every other day. He is 5L negative over the last two days on the current schedule of HD/UF. His urine output (UOP) is still low but improving daily.
4. Hypertension: Hydralazine was stopped as the hypertension was felt to be sedation-related. Sedation should be titrated in response to blood pressure, and hydralazine can be used as needed if it becomes an issue during weaning.
5. Shock Liver: LFTs are improving daily.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's volume overload poses a significant barrier to extubation. If fluid removal through HD/UF is not effective, the patient may develop further respiratory compromise or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. BCG Reaction: The patient is at risk for complications related to the hypersensitivity reaction, such as diffuse M. bovis granuloma formation if the steroid taper is slowed down too quickly.
3. Renal Failure: If the patient's renal function does not improve, he may require long-term dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
4. Hypertension: If blood pressure is not well-controlled during weaning from sedation, the patient may experience complications related to uncontrolled hypertension, such as intracranial hemorrhage or cardiac events.
5. Shock Liver: Although LFTs are improving, there is still a risk of liver dysfunction or failure, which can lead to complications such as coagulopathy or hepatic encephalopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   88yM with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic-like shock
   shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer secondary to
   either disseminated m.bovis infection vs cytokine-driven
   hypersensitivity reaction.  Continues to be ventilator dependent
   because of volume overload which we are successfully improving with
   HD/UF.
   #. Respiratory Failure:   Initial insult ARDS secondary to the post-BCG
   inflammatory response.  Fluid overload is still his primary barrier to
   extubation.  Currently getting HD every other day and UF on the days in
   between with goal 2-3 L fluid removal daily
off HD yesterday over
   nursing considerations, back on UF/HD today.
   - continue AC ventilation; get NIF this PM
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF
   - will re-try lightening sedation and moving toward PSV in the upcoming
   days as he approaches euvolemia
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   #. BCG Reaction: Leukocytosis, fevers resolved, no signs or symptoms of
   any infection.  He is currently on empiric treatment with both
   antibiotics for possible infection and  a steroid taper for possible
   hypersensitivity rxn.  Steroid taper has been accelerated and he will
   be transitioning to 20mg IV tid of hydrocort tomorrow for one
   week
further slow titration to follow: one reported complication of
   fast tapers in this condition is diffuse mbovis granuloma formation
   (per up-to-date)
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection; need to determine duration
   - hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID X 1 WEEK, and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time
   - Continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   #. Renal Failure:  HD and UF alternating QOD.  He is 5L negative over
   the last two days on current schedule of HD/UF.  UOP still  low, but
   improving daily.
   - Continue HD with minimum 3L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   - tunnelled line CONVERSION postponed given increase in UOP and
   potential of renal recovery
   # Hypertension:  Stopped hydral as HTN felt to be sedation related.
   Titrate sedation in response to BP as well. Hydral prn if becomes an
   issue with weaning.
   #. Shock Liver:  LFTs improving daily.
   - trend LFTs daily
   # Goals of Care: per last discussion with family, it seems that they
   would not want to pursue trach/peg, making expeditious volume removal
   and subsequent extubation more pressing issues given his risk for
   myopathy (advanced age, high doses of steroids).

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer. The possible causes of his condition include disseminated m. bovis infection or a cytokine-driven hypersensitivity reaction. He continues to be ventilator dependent due to volume overload, which is being managed with hemodialysis (HD) and ultrafiltration (UF). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include respiratory failure, BCG reaction, renal failure, hypertension, and liver dysfunction. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to post-BCG inflammatory response and fluid overload. The BCG reaction may result in leukocytosis and fevers, and there is a risk of diffuse m. bovis granuloma formation if the steroid taper is slowed down too quickly. Renal failure is indicated by low urine output and the need for HD and UF. Hypertension may be related to sedation, and the liver dysfunction is improving daily. 

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful management to address the various complications and optimize his chances of recovery."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock following a second BCG instillation. The patient's condition has led to respiratory failure and renal failure.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with AC ventilation mode, sedated, and intubated. Efforts are being made to remove volume via hemodialysis (HD) every other day and ultrafiltration (UF) on the days in between, aiming to remove 3-4 liters of fluid daily. The goal is to approach euvolemia and eventually extubate the patient.

The patient also has acute renal failure due to hypotension, for which he is on HD and UF alternating every other day. His urine output has been low but improving daily. A conversion of HD tunnelled line has been postponed as there is an increase in urine output and potential resolution of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

Additionally, the patient is experiencing a BCG reaction, characterized by fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis. He is on empiric antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for hypersensitivity reaction. The course of antibiotics is expected to be prolonged (months), and the steroid taper needs to be slow and prolonged due to the patient's advanced age and critical illness.

The patient has labile blood pressure in the setting of sedation and a history of hypertension"

   Assessment and Plan
   88M w acute onset of respiratory distress and septic-like shock shortly
   after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer [**2-22**] either
   disseminated M. bovis infection vs cytokine-driven hypersensitivity
   reaction.  Continues to be ventilator dependent because of volume
   overload, slowly improving with HD/UF.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Initial insult ARDS secondary to the post-BCG
   inflammatory response.  Fluid overload is still his primary barrier to
   extubation.  Currently getting HD every other day and UF on the days in
   between with goal 2-3 L fluid removal daily
off HD yesterday over
   nursing considerations, back on UF/HD today.
   - continue AC ventilation; get NIF this PM
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF
   - will re-try lightening sedation and moving toward PSV in the upcoming
   days as he approaches euvolemia
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   # BCG Reaction: Leukocytosis, fevers resolved, no signs or symptoms of
   any infection.  He is currently on empiric treatment with both
   antibiotics for possible infection and  a steroid taper for possible
   hypersensitivity rxn.  Steroid taper has been accelerated and he will
   be transitioning to 20mg IV tid of hydrocort tomorrow for one
   week
further slow titration to follow: one reported complication of
   fast tapers in this condition is diffuse mbovis granuloma formation
   (per up-to-date)
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin IV ongoing for possible atypical
   mycobacterial infection; need to determine duration
   - hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID X 1 WEEK, and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time
   - Continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   # Renal Failure:  HD and UF alternating QOD.  He is 5L negative over
   the last two days on current schedule of HD/UF.  UOP still  low, but
   improving daily.
   - Continue HD with minimum 3L fluid removal today alternating with
   ultrafiltration
   - tunnelled line CONVERSION postponed given increase in UOP and
   potential of renal recovery
   # Hypertension:  Stopped hydral as HTN felt to be sedation related.
   Titrate sedation in response to BP as well. Hydral prn if becomes an
   issue with weaning.
   # Shock Liver:  LFTs improving daily.
   - trend LFTs daily
   # Goals of Care: per last discussion with family, it seems that they
   would not want to pursue trach/peg, making expeditious volume removal
   and subsequent extubation more pressing issues given his risk for
   myopathy (advanced age, high doses of steroids).

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder cancer.
- The patient continues to be ventilator-dependent due to volume overload, which is slowly improving with hemodialysis (HD) and ultrafiltration (UF).
- Initial insult was ARDS secondary to the post-BCG inflammatory response.
- Fluid overload remains the primary barrier to extubation.
- The patient has been on empiric treatment with antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for a possible hypersensitivity reaction.
- Renal failure is being managed with alternating HD and UF, aiming for a minimum of 3L fluid removal daily.
- Hypertension has been addressed by stopping hydralazine as it was felt to be sedation-related.
- Liver function tests are improving daily.
- Goals of care include expeditious volume removal and subsequent extubation, considering the patient's advanced age and high doses of steroids.
- Nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding at 40 mL/hour.
- Multiple lines have been inserted, including a dialysis catheter, multi-lumen line, and arterial line.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with bladder cancer who is experiencing acute respiratory failure and septic-like shock after receiving a second Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillation. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure and renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS post-BCG inflammatory response, which is now the primary barrier to extubation. The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient developed ATN from hypotension and is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and ultrafiltration (UF) alternating every other day for volume overload. The goal is to remove 3-4 liters of fluid daily.

3. BCG Reaction: The patient presented with fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis, which could be due to either Mycobacterium bovis sepsis or BCG hypersensitivity. The patient is on empirical antibiotics and steroid taper.

4. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressure, especially in the setting of sedation. Monitoring pressures and discontinuing pressors are recommended.

5. Shock Liver: The patient has shock liver from hypotension, with improving liver function tests daily. Continued trending of LFTs is advised.

   hypersensitivity reaction). Pt became fluid overloaded, which is
   currently the primary barrier to extubation.  Currently getting HD
   every other day and UF on the days in between with goal 3-4 L fluid
   removal daily.
   - continue AC ventilation
   - continue to remove volume via HD/UF (HD today)
   - will re-try lightening sedation and moving toward PSV in the upcoming
   days as he approaches euvolemia
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   - f/u sputum cxs
   # Acute Renal Failure: [**2-22**] ATN from hypotension. Pt on HD and UF
   alternating QOD for volume overload. UOP still  low, but  improving

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who developed acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock after receiving BCG therapy. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure initially caused by ARDS following the BCG inflammatory response. He has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure due to hypotension, resulting in ATN. The patient was found to have a reaction to BCG therapy, which included fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis, and he is being treated with antibiotics and steroid taper. He has labile hypertension, liver dysfunction from hypotension, and his goals of care include expeditious volume removal and subsequent extubation. The patient's current condition is as follows: 
- Vital signs: Tcurrent: 35.8°C, HR: 81 bpm, BP: 144/87 mmHg, RR: 13 insp/min, SpO2: 100%

   septic-like shock s/p second BCG instillation, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] w course c/b respiratory failure and renal failure.
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Etiology initially was ARDS [**2-22**] post-BCG
   inflammatory response (M. bovis sepsis vs cytokine-driven
   hypersensitivity reaction), now fluid overload, which is currently the
   primary barrier to extubation. Getting HD every other day and UF on the
   days in between with goal 3-4 L fluid removal daily.
   - continue AC ventilation, attempt to switch to PSV
   - plan for SBT and extubation tomorrow, if tolerates
   - continue HD with 3-4L fluid removal alternating with ultrafiltration
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   - f/u sputum cxs
   # Acute Renal Failure: [**2-22**] ATN from hypotension. Pt on HD and UF
   alternating QOD for volume overload. UOP still  low, but  improving
   daily.
   - monitor electrolytes, Cr, BUN
   - continue HD with 3-4L fluid removal alternating with ultrafiltration
   - HD tunnelled line CONVERSION postponed given increase in UOP and
   potential of ATN resolution and renal recovery
   # BCG Reaction: Pt originally p/w fever, hypotension, leukocytosis,
   which is thought to be either M. bovis sepsis vs BCG hypersensitivity.
   Pt on empiric antibiotics for possible infection and steroid taper for
   possible hypersensitivity rxn. Steroid taper has been accelerated given
   pts advanced age and critical illness.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin (day 1: [**6-8**]) for possible M. bovis
   infection, prolonged course expected (months per ID)
   - Hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID ([**Date range (1) 6387**]), and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time
   - on dapsone 100mg daily (Bactrim d/c
d on [**6-21**] given possible
   myelosuppression)
   # Labile blood pressue: likely in the setting of sedation, off

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who has been admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock following a second Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS due to an inflammatory response post-BCG therapy. Currently, the primary barrier to extubation is fluid overload. The patient is receiving hemodialysis (HD) every other day and ultrafiltration (UF) on alternate days to remove excess fluid.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension. He is on HD and UF alternating every other day for volume overload. The patient's urine output is still low but improving daily.

3. BCG Reaction: The patient presented with fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis, which could be due to either Mycobacterium bovis sepsis or BCG hypersensitivity. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for hypersensitivity reaction.

4. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has labile blood pressure that may be related to sedation and the absence of vasopressors.

5. Transaminitis: The patient experienced hepatic ischemia from hypotension, but liver"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with bladder cancer who experienced acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock after a second BCG instillation. He was transferred to the ICU and developed respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and has had several complications including fever, line infection, and possible fungal infection. He is currently on antibiotics and antifungal medication. The patient's condition is complicated by fluid overload, which is hindering his extubation. He is also on a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity reaction to BCG therapy. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and liver enzymes. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with intermittent apnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's prognosis is guarded due to advanced age, prolonged steroid exposure, and multiple organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Line infection: The patient has had multiple lines and catheters, which increases the risk of line-related infections.
3. Fungal infection: The patient's sputum culture showed yeast, indicating a possible fungal infection.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has elevated creatinine levels and is on hemodialysis, suggesting renal impairment.

","The patient is an elderly man with a history of bladder cancer who underwent BCG therapy. He presented with acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock, and was transferred to the ICU where he developed respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis due to fluid overload.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation time, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. The patient's sputum gram stain showed yeast, which may indicate colonization rather than infection. However, further monitoring and follow-up are necessary.

2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The central line was removed yesterday, but there is still a possibility of infection due to the previous use of the line. Blood cultures have been obtained, and antibiotic coverage has been broadened to include Zosyn.

3. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient has been negative for CDI three times, so it is less likely to be a current concern. However, it should still be monitored.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, and he is on hemodialysis due to fluid overload. It is important to monitor his electrolytes, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels regularly.

   Assessment and Plan
   88M w bladder cancer s/p BCG therapy c/b acute respiratory distress and
   septic-like shock s/p second BCG instillation, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] w course c/b respiratory failure and renal failure.
   # FEVER: Possible sources include central line, VAP, C. diff,
   continuing reaction to BCG instillation.  Micro to date includes blood
   culture ([**6-23**]) with GPC in pairs and clusters, UA ([**6-23**]) with large leuk
   and few bacteria, sputum gram stain ([**6-23**]) with yeast.  Central line
   removed yesterday, C. diff negative x 3.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.  Per ID, yeast in sputum is likely colonizer given
   patient
s length of intubation.  Zosyn added to existing antibiotic
   regimen (Vanc, Rifampin, Levofloxacin, Dapsone) for empiric coverage.
   - dose vanco at HD
   - draw cultures off hemodialysis line at HD today
   - f/u final cxs
   - f/u G6PD
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Etiology initially was ARDS [**2-22**] post-BCG
   inflammatory response (M. bovis sepsis vs cytokine-driven
   hypersensitivity reaction), now fluid overload, which is currently the
   primary barrier to extubation. Getting HD today, UF on alternate days,
   with goal 2 L fluid removal today.  Breathing trial yesterday produced
   tachypnea with RR 35-40.
   - after HD will attempt PS trial
   - continue propofol at 20
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   - plan for now is to attempt to optimize fluid status till early next
   week, then attempting to come off ventilator.  Will need to clarify
   with family whether they would want re-intubation if this fails.
   - f/u sputum cxs
   # Acute Renal Failure: [**2-22**] ATN from hypotension. Pt on HD and UF
   alternating Q other day for volume overload. UOP still  low.  Patient
   is +19 L for LOS.
   - phosphate binder held and IV sodium phosphate given per renal recs
   - monitor electrolytes, Cr, BUN
   - HD today with goal -2 L
   - HD tunnelled line conversion likely to be necessary given persistent
   low UOP, especially if patient continues to spike fevers and/or have
   positive blood cultures
   # BCG Reaction: Pt originally p/w fever, hypotension, leukocytosis,
   which is thought to be either M. bovis sepsis vs BCG hypersensitivity.
   Pt on empiric antibiotics for possible infection and steroid taper for
   possible hypersensitivity rxn. Steroid taper has been accelerated given
   pts advanced age and critical illness.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin (day 1: [**6-8**]) for possible M. bovis
   infection, prolonged course expected (months per ID)
   - Hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID ([**Date range (1) 6387**]), and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time
   - on dapsone 100mg daily (Bactrim d/c
d on [**6-21**] given possible
   myelosuppression)
   # Labile blood pressure: likely in the setting of sedation, off
   pressors.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old man with a history of bladder cancer who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock following a second Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillation. He was transferred to the ICU where he developed respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a central line infection, which has been treated with antibiotics. The patient's fever may be due to various causes including central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or a reaction to BCG instillation. He has also shown signs of acute respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient is receiving hemodialysis and fluid removal is being attempted to optimize his fluid status before attempting to extubate him.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient initially had a central line, which was removed due to infection. However, he may still be at risk for developing a bloodstream infection from other sources, especially since he has had persistent fever spikes.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. This increases the risk of developing pneumonia, particularly if proper infection control measures are not followed.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially presented with ARDS, which can lead to severe lung damage and respiratory failure.
4. Acute renal failure"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of bladder cancer who developed acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock after a second Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillation. He was transferred to the ICU where he required mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy due to respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes fever, central line removal, negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test, and no yeast in sputum. His vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but decreased urine output. The patient is on multiple antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for hypersensitivity reaction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor for any changes in sputum culture and perform frequent chest X-rays.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): Since the central line has been removed, the risk of CRBSI is reduced. However, close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
3. Delirium: The patient's advanced age and prolonged sedation increase the risk of delirium. Frequent assessment of mental status and regular reorientation are essential.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness"

   88M w bladder cancer s/p BCG therapy c/b acute respiratory distress and
   septic-like shock s/p second BCG instillation, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] w course c/b respiratory failure and renal failure.
   # FEVER: Possible sources include central line, VAP, C. diff,
   continuing reaction to BCG instillation.  Micro to date includes blood
   culture ([**6-23**]) with GPC in pairs and clusters, UA ([**6-23**]) with large leuk
   and few bacteria, sputum gram stain ([**6-23**]) with yeast.  Central line
   removed yesterday, C. diff negative x 3.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.  Per ID, yeast in sputum is likely colonizer given
   patient
s length of intubation.  Zosyn added to existing antibiotic
   regimen (Vanc, Rifampin, Levofloxacin, Dapsone) for empiric coverage.
   - dose vanco at HD
   - draw cultures off hemodialysis line at HD today
   - f/u final cxs
   - f/u G6PD
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Etiology initially was ARDS [**2-22**] post-BCG
   inflammatory response (M. bovis sepsis vs cytokine-driven
   hypersensitivity reaction), now fluid overload, which is currently the
   primary barrier to extubation. Getting HD today, UF on alternate days,
   with goal 2 L fluid removal today.  Breathing trial yesterday produced
   tachypnea with RR 35-40.
   - after HD will attempt PS trial
   - continue propofol at 20
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   - plan for now is to attempt to optimize fluid status till early next
   week, then attempting to come off ventilator.  Will need to clarify
   with family whether they would want re-intubation if this fails.
   - f/u sputum cxs
   # Acute Renal Failure: [**2-22**] ATN from hypotension. Pt on HD and UF
   alternating Q other day for volume overload. UOP still  low.  Patient
   is +19 L for LOS.
   - phosphate binder held and IV sodium phosphate given per renal recs
   - monitor electrolytes, Cr, BUN
   - HD today with goal -2 L
   - HD tunnelled line conversion likely to be necessary given persistent
   low UOP, especially if patient continues to spike fevers and/or have
   positive blood cultures
   # BCG Reaction: Pt originally p/w fever, hypotension, leukocytosis,
   which is thought to be either M. bovis sepsis vs BCG hypersensitivity.
   Pt on empiric antibiotics for possible infection and steroid taper for
   possible hypersensitivity rxn. Steroid taper has been accelerated given
   pts advanced age and critical illness.
   - Rifampin + Levofloxacin (day 1: [**6-8**]) for possible M. bovis
   infection, prolonged course expected (months per ID)
   - Hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID ([**Date range (1) 6387**]), and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time
   - on dapsone 100mg daily (Bactrim d/c
d on [**6-21**] given possible
   myelosuppression)
   # Labile blood pressure: likely in the setting of sedation, off
   pressors.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an elderly man with a history of bladder cancer who underwent BCG therapy and subsequently developed acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock.
- He was transferred to the ICU where he experienced respiratory failure and renal failure.
- The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure.
- He has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (ATN) from hypotension and is on hemodialysis.
- The patient is suspected to have a BCG reaction, which is thought to be either M. bovis sepsis or a hypersensitivity reaction.
- He has been on empiric antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity reaction.
- The patient's blood culture grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, prompting a change in antibiotic coverage to include Zosyn.
- Central lines have been removed, and PIV lines have been placed.
- Repeat urinalysis showed no yeast.
- Phosphate binder has been stopped due to a phosphate level of 1.9.
- The patient has tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) three times.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/66 mmHg to 138/87 mmHg, respiratory rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   88M w bladder cancer s/p BCG therapy c/b acute respiratory distress and
   septic-like shock s/p second BCG instillation, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] w course c/b respiratory failure and renal failure.
   # FEVER: Possible sources include central line, VAP, C. diff,
   continuing reaction to BCG instillation.  Micro to date includes blood
   culture ([**6-23**]) with GPC in pairs and clusters, UA ([**6-23**]) with large leuk
   and few bacteria, sputum gram stain ([**6-23**]) with yeast.  Central line
   out, cultures taken off remaining HD line with NGTD.  C. diff negative
   x 3.  CXR without clear infiltrate.  Per ID, yeast in sputum is likely
   colonizer given patient
s length of intubation.  Zosyn added to
   existing antibiotic regimen for empiric coverage.
   - continue vanc, zosyn (for + blood cultures), and rifampin, dapsone,
   levofloxacin (for BCG)
   - f/u cxs, if no GNR growth in blood cultures by this evening (total of
   48 hrs without growth), will d/c zosyn
   - f/u G6PD
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Etiology initially was ARDS [**2-22**] post-BCG
   inflammatory response (M. bovis sepsis vs cytokine-driven
   hypersensitivity reaction), now fluid overload, which is currently the
   primary barrier to extubation. Getting HD today, UF on alternate days,
   with goal 2 L fluid removal today.  Breathing trial yesterday produced
   tachypnea with RR 35-40.
   - after HD will attempt PS trial
   - continue propofol at 20
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   - plan for now is to attempt to optimize fluid status till early next
   week, then attempting to come off ventilator.  Will need to clarify
   with family whether they would want re-intubation if this fails.
   - f/u sputum cxs
   # Acute Renal Failure: [**2-22**] ATN from hypotension. Pt on HD and UF
   alternating Q other day for volume overload. UOP still  low.
   Electrolyte values yesterday within normal limits.
   - monitor electrolytes, Cr, BUN
   - HD tunnelled line conversion likely to be necessary given persistent
   low UOP
   # BCG Reaction: Pt originally p/w fever, hypotension, leukocytosis,
   which is thought to be either M. bovis sepsis vs BCG hypersensitivity.
   Pt on empiric antibiotics for possible infection and steroid taper for
   possible hypersensitivity rxn. Steroid taper has been accelerated given
   pts advanced age and critical illness.
   - Rifampin, Levofloxacin, Dapsone for possible M. bovis infection,
   prolonged course expected (months per ID)
   - Hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID ([**Date range (1) 6387**]), and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock following a second BCG instillation. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure and renal failure. 

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving propofol for sedation and has been diagnosed with a central line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and possible Clostridium difficile infection. The yeast found in the sputum is considered a colonizer due to the patient's prolonged intubation. 

The patient's fluid overload is currently the primary barrier to extubation. He will undergo hemodialysis (HD) today and every other day to remove excess fluid. A breathing trial yesterday resulted in tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 35-40 breaths per minute. 

The patient also has acute renal failure, which began on [**2-22**] and is believed to be caused by hypotension. He is on intermittent hemodialysis and ultrafiltration to manage his fluid overload and low urine output. 

In addition to the medical complications, the patient is also being treated for a suspected reaction to the BCG therapy, including fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis. He is receiving empiric antibiotics and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity reaction.

   Assessment and Plan
   88M w bladder cancer s/p BCG therapy c/b acute respiratory distress and
   septic-like shock s/p second BCG instillation, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] w course c/b respiratory failure and renal failure.
   # FEVER: Likely source was central line causing bacteremia seen on
   blood cultures yesterday.  Zosyn added empirically to existing
   antibiotic regimen for positive blood cultures.
   - continue vanc, zosyn (for + blood cultures), and rifampin, dapsone,
   levofloxacin (for BCG)
   - f/u cxs, if afebrile and no GNR growth in blood cultures by this
   evening (total of 48 hrs), will d/c zosyn
   - f/u G6PD
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Etiology initially was ARDS [**2-22**] post-BCG
   inflammatory response (M. bovis sepsis vs cytokine-driven
   hypersensitivity reaction), now fluid overload, which is currently the
   primary barrier to extubation.  Two liters removed on HD yesterday,
   subsequently patient tolerated PS for > 12 hrs before requiring
   conversion to AC.  This morning on PS again.
   - continue propofol at 20
   - PS trial again today
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   - plan for now is to attempt to optimize fluid status till early next
   week, then attempting to come off ventilator.  Will need to clarify
   with family whether they would want re-intubation if this fails.
   - f/u sputum cxs
   # Acute Renal Failure: [**2-22**] ATN from hypotension. Pt  has been receiving
   HP M/W/F. [**Month/Day (2) 1349**] still low.  Electrolyte values yesterday within normal
   limits.
   - discussed plan for accelerated fluid removal with renal fellow, she
   will arrange for aggressive negative fluid goals at HD Monday with
   possible extra sessions on Monday afternoon and Tuesday
   - monitor electrolytes, Cr, BUN
   - HD tunnelled line conversion likely to be necessary given persistent
   low [**Last Name (LF) 1349**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] re-visit issue with family next week follow clarification
   of patient
s respiratory status
   # BCG Reaction: Pt originally p/w fever, hypotension, leukocytosis,
   which is thought to be either M. bovis sepsis vs BCG hypersensitivity.
   Pt on empiric antibiotics for possible infection and steroid taper for
   possible hypersensitivity rxn. Steroid taper has been accelerated given
   pts advanced age and critical illness.
   - Rifampin, Levofloxacin, Dapsone for possible M. bovis infection,
   prolonged course expected (months per ID)
   - Hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID ([**Date range (1) 6387**]), and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock after receiving BCG therapy. He was transferred to the ICU where he developed respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including fever, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and a BCG reaction. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and his fluid overload is the primary barrier to extubation. The plan is to optimize his fluid status until early next week before attempting to come off the ventilator. Potential medical complications include worsening respiratory failure, failure to wean off the ventilator, renal failure, and infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is a critical concern. If his condition deteriorates, he may require increased support or intervention, such as higher levels of oxygen or increased pressure support ventilation.

2. Failure to Wean off the Ventilator: The patient's fluid overload is currently the main reason he cannot be extubated. If the fluid removal process is unsuccessful or if his respiratory status does not improve, he may not be able to be weaned off the ventilator, leading to prolonged mechanical ventilation and associated risks.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has already experienced acute renal failure, which was likely due to hypotension. Monitoring electrolyte levels and renal function will be essential to prevent further"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who developed acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock following a second Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy instillation. He was transferred to the ICU and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient also has acute renal failure secondary to hypotension. He has been receiving hemodialysis (HD) and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. The patient's condition has been complicated by a fever, which was initially thought to be caused by a central line infection, and he has positive blood cultures. He is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), rifampin, levofloxacin, and dapsone, for possible M. bovis infection or BCG hypersensitivity reaction. The patient's fluid overload is currently the primary barrier to extubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged steroid exposure and advanced age increase the risk of complications such as immunosuppression, delayed wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infections.
2. The patient's acute respiratory failure can lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. The patient's positive blood cultures indicate a risk of"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90 kg, 69-inch male admitted to the ICU on 2196-6-19 with the chief complaint of acute respiratory failure secondary to septic shock. The patient was intubated on 2196-6-19 at 03:30 PM and placed on SIMV/PRVC mode ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, PS of 12 cmH2O, RR set at 10, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 65. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.5°C, HR: 103 bpm, BP: 172/84 mmHg, RR: 24 insp/min, and SpO2: 100%. The patient has been on propofol infusion at 20 mcg/kg/min and receiving multiple IV antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. 

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, PaO2 of 129 mmHg, HCO3- of 26 mEq/L, BE of -2 mEq/L, Glucose of 123 mg/dL, WBC of 5.3 K/uL, Hct of 21.4%, Plt of 179 K/uL, Cr of 5.7 mg/dL, TCO2 of 25 mEq/L, and CK of 301 U/L. 

The patient's physical examination is significant for intubation and sedation. The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 759 mL since 12 AM. The patient's weight is currently 649 kg, down from the admission weight of 90 kg. 

The patient's laboratory values are within normal limits except for elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels. 

The patient's medical complications include hypertension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), septic shock, acute renal failure, DIC, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been on aggressive diuresis to optimize their medical condition for possible attempted extubation early next week. The family has been consulted regarding the goals of care, and the plan is to clarify whether they desire reintubation in the event of failure. The patient's code status is DNR."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who experienced acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock after receiving BCG therapy. He was transferred to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension, and is receiving hemodialysis three times a week. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum culture.

2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has a central line, which increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, chills, and positive blood cultures is crucial.

3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of renal parameters such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is necessary. Adjustments in fluid and electrolyte management may be required.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to PE. Prophylactic measures such"

   88M w bladder cancer s/p BCG therapy c/b acute respiratory distress and
   septic-like shock s/p second BCG instillation, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] w course c/b respiratory failure and renal failure.
   # FEVER: Likely source was central line causing bacteremia seen on
   blood cultures yesterday.  Zosyn added empirically to existing
   antibiotic regimen for positive blood cultures.
   - continue vanc, zosyn (for + blood cultures), and rifampin, dapsone,
   levofloxacin (for BCG)
   - f/u cxs, if afebrile and no GNR growth in blood cultures by this
   evening (total of 48 hrs), will d/c zosyn
   - f/u G6PD
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Etiology initially was ARDS [**2-22**] post-BCG
   inflammatory response (M. bovis sepsis vs cytokine-driven
   hypersensitivity reaction), now fluid overload, which is currently the
   primary barrier to extubation.  Two liters removed on HD yesterday,
   subsequently patient tolerated PS for > 12 hrs before requiring
   conversion to AC.  This morning on PS again.
   - continue propofol at 20
   - PS trial again today
   - some urgency to volume removal and extubation given pt
s advanced age
   and prolonged steroid exposure
   - plan for now is to attempt to optimize fluid status till early next
   week, then attempting to come off ventilator.  Will need to clarify
   with family whether they would want re-intubation if this fails.
   - f/u sputum cxs
   # Acute Renal Failure: [**2-22**] ATN from hypotension. Pt  has been receiving
   HP M/W/F. [**Month/Day (2) 1349**] still low.  Electrolyte values yesterday within normal
   limits.
   - discussed plan for accelerated fluid removal with renal fellow, she
   will arrange for aggressive negative fluid goals at HD Monday with
   possible extra sessions on Monday afternoon and Tuesday
   - monitor electrolytes, Cr, BUN
   - HD tunnelled line conversion likely to be necessary given persistent
   low [**Last Name (LF) 1349**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] re-visit issue with family next week follow clarification
   of patient
s respiratory status
   # BCG Reaction: Pt originally p/w fever, hypotension, leukocytosis,
   which is thought to be either M. bovis sepsis vs BCG hypersensitivity.
   Pt on empiric antibiotics for possible infection and steroid taper for
   possible hypersensitivity rxn. Steroid taper has been accelerated given
   pts advanced age and critical illness.
   - Rifampin, Levofloxacin, Dapsone for possible M. bovis infection,
   prolonged course expected (months per ID)
   - Hydrocortisone taper to  20 mg IV TID ([**Date range (1) 6387**]), and subsequnent slow
   taper for a prolonged time

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock following a second Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillation. He was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure and renal failure. 

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- The patient has a fever, which is likely due to a central line infection causing bacteremia, as indicated by positive blood cultures.
- He is receiving multiple antibiotics empirically, including Zosyn, Vancomycin, Rifampin, Dapsone, and Levofloxacin.
- The patient also has acute respiratory failure initially caused by ARDS post-BCG inflammatory response, now complicated by fluid overload. He has had two liters of fluid removed through hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- The plan is to continue with propofol sedation and attempt PSV again today. There is an urgency to remove excess fluids and extubate the patient due to his advanced age and prolonged steroid exposure. If extubation fails, the family's consent for re-intubation will be clarified.
- The patient also has acute renal failure secondary to hypotension, with ongoing hemodialysis sessions. Electrolyte values are within normal limits.
- The patient's BCG reaction is being managed with empiric antibiotics for possible Mycobacterium bovis sepsis or"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who presented with acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock following a second BCG instillation. He was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including likely central line infection, acute respiratory failure initially caused by ARDS post-BCG inflammatory response, and acute renal failure from hypotension leading to ATN. The patient's current plan includes continuing vancomycin, restarting Zosyn, and monitoring for G6PD deficiency. He is also being managed for fluid overload, and the family will meet today to discuss goals of care and extubation plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central line infection: The patient has fevers, and there is a suspicion of a coag-neg Staphylococcus central line infection. Continuing vancomycin and possibly removing the HD line may be necessary.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS post-BCG inflammatory response, and now he is experiencing fluid overload, making it difficult to extubate him. Optimizing fluid status and attempting to wean off the ventilator are the current goals.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has ATN due to hypotension. Aggressive negative fluid goals during HD sessions and monitoring electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN are planned.
4. BCG Reaction: The patient had"

The patient is an 88-year-old woman with bladder cancer who experienced acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock after receiving BCG therapy. She was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has a fever, likely caused by a central line infection with coag-negative Staphylococcus. She is currently on vancomycin, Zosyn, and rifampin for the infection. The patient also has acute respiratory failure initially caused by ARDS post-BCG inflammatory response, now complicated by fluid overload. She is on mechanical ventilation and receiving propofol. The plan is to optimize her fluid status and attempt extubation early next week, considering her advanced age and prolonged steroid exposure. Acute renal failure occurred from hypotension, and the patient has been receiving dialysis three times a week. Electrolyte values are within normal limits. The patient is also being treated for a possible BCG reaction, with antibiotics and steroid taper. Her nutrition is being managed with enteral feeding, and she has multiple lines including a dialysis catheter. The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central line infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures suggest a central line infection. This can lead to sepsis and potentially worsen her respiratory and renal conditions.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's respiratory failure is now complicated by fluid overload, making it challenging"

   minute ventilation. Also now requiring increased propofol, unclear why,
   may be related to infection.
   - continue on propofol at 40, try to wean
   - continuing volume removal with HD

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who developed acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock after a second BCG instillation. He was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure and renal failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever: The patient is likely experiencing a central line infection caused by coag-neg Staphylococcus. Vancomycin will be continued for 14 days on HD protocol.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The etiology of the respiratory failure initially included ARDS post-BCG inflammatory response (M. bovis sepsis vs cytokine-driven hypersensitivity reaction). The patient now has fluid overload, which is hindering extubation. Propofol will be continued at 40, with an attempt to wean. Volume removal with HD will continue, and the plan is to optimize fluid status until early next week before attempting to come off the ventilator. Family meeting will be held today to discuss the possibility of re-intubation if extubation fails.

   Code status: CMO on morphine gtt
   Disposition: Likely will not survive long on morphine gtt.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer who experienced acute respiratory distress and septic-like shock after a second BCG instillation. He was transferred to the ICU where he developed respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient is currently extubated and on morphine gtt as a comfort measure due to poor prognosis.

The patient has several medical complications:
1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which are likely due to a central line infection caused by coag-neg Staph. Antibiotics were stopped, and the patient is now on morphine gtt.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: Initially caused by ARDS post-BCG inflammatory response, now secondary to fluid overload. The patient had to change ventilation settings due to low minute ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Caused by hypotension leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has been receiving hemodialysis (HD) three times a week, but is currently off HD.
4. BCG Reaction: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis, which could be due to either Mycobacterium bovis sepsis or BCG hypersensitivity. The patient was given empiric antibiotics for possible infection and a steroid taper for possible hypersensitivity reaction. Antibiotics have since been discontinued.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to fluid"
