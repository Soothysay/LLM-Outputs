   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD & CHF presents with lower
   extremity edema & acute hct drop likely due to lower GI bleed in
   setting of elevated INR.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Pt presented with acute hct drop in setting of elevated
   INR, now s/p FFP x 1 and Vitamin K 10mg IV and 2 units PRBCs.  HCT did
   not increase as much as expected ([**3-29**]) but did respond, so this is
   unlikely a brisk GI bleed.  Pt was guaic positive with brown stool,
   etiology of bleed not entirely clear and pt denies any BRBPR/melena,
   nausea/epigastric pain, no prior history GI bleed.  Possible sources
   are a slow upper GI bleed (ulcer vs esophageal varices? ETOH history),
   diverticular bleed.  Slight possibility that thoracic aneurysm is
   bleeding as it has not yet been imaged, but patient is asymptomatic so
   this is unlikely.  Unlikely head, retroperitoneal bleed.
   - maintain active type & cross
   - transfuse 2u prbcs now with lasix 40mg IV in between
   - 2 x PIVs
   - NPO for now, possible EGD in am
   - GI consult
   - PPI IV BID
   -image thoracic aneurysm
   .
   # CHF: Pt has a history CHF s/p MI with depressed EF that has since
   improved, last echo from [**12-29**] showed EF of 50%. Pt reports acute on
   chronic lower extremity swelling but lungs clear on exam. BNP elevated
   at 4054, however, exam not impressive for left sided volume overload
   with clear lungs and minimal oxygen requirement.
   - transfuse with prbcs and lasix 40mg IV between units
   - supplemental oxygen
   - f/u ECHO in am
   - holding Captopril/Metoprolol for now given marginal BP in ED
   - may restart ACE/BB in am
   - monitor strict i/os
   .
   # CAD:  Pt with CAD s/p STEMI and 3VD with 5 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4401**] placed in [**5-27**].
   Pt reports recent exertional exhaustion but denies chest pain.  This
   could be stable angina, but this is occurring in setting of acute hct
   drop, more likely demand ischemia.  EKG does not show any acute ST-T
   wave changes, will monitor for symptoms
   - continue with prbc transfusions
   - holding Aspirin 81mg given GI bleed, may restart in am
   - will restart Metoprolol, Captopril if hct/BP stable in am
   - holding statin given NPO
   - f/u am EKG
   .
   # AFib: Pt with h/o AFib, presenting with GI bleed and INR>4.  Rate
   currently well controlled in 70s.  Holding BB given marginal BPs on
   presentation.
   - holding coumadin, BB for now
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Lower extremity edema: Pt with impressive lower extremity swelling,
   but does not clinically appear to be in significant left sided heart
   failure and negative hepatojugular reflex. Unclear why pt would have
   predominant right sided heart failure, raises concern for DVT vs pelvic
   clot given pelvic clot.
   - f/u lower extremity u/s to r/o DVT
   - consider venous MRA if clinically indicated in am
   .
   # ETOH: Pt with ETOH history, denies withdrawal but difficult
   historian. Will place on CIWA protocol for now.
   - ativan 1-2mg IV q4 hr prn
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   - monitor lytes with diuresis & replete aggressively

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD & CHF presents with lower
   extremity edema & acute hct drop likely due to lower GI bleed in
   setting of elevated INR.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Pt presented with acute hct drop in setting of elevated
   INR, now s/p FFP x 1 and Vitamin K 10mg IV and 2 units PRBCs.  HCT did
   not increase as much as expected ([**3-29**]) but did respond, so this is
   unlikely a brisk GI bleed.  Pt was guaic positive with brown stool,
   etiology of bleed not entirely clear and pt denies any BRBPR/melena,
   nausea/epigastric pain, no prior history GI bleed.  Possible sources
   are a slow upper GI bleed (ulcer vs esophageal varices? ETOH history),
   diverticular bleed.  Slight possibility that thoracic aneurysm is
   bleeding as it has not yet been imaged, but patient is asymptomatic so
   this is unlikely.  Unlikely head, retroperitoneal bleed.   Hemolysis
   remains a possibility.
   - maintain active type & cross
   - transfuse 2u prbcs now with lasix 40mg IV in between
   - 2 x PIVs
   - EGD today, will need FFP for INR <1.5
   - f/u GI recs
   - PPI IV BID
   -image thoracic aneurysm
   -HCT q4h
   -check hemolysis labs
   .
   # CHF: Pt has a history CHF s/p MI with depressed EF that has since
   improved, last echo from [**12-29**] showed EF of 50%. Pt reports acute on
   chronic lower extremity swelling but lungs clear on exam. BNP elevated
   at 4054.  Possible high output failure [**1-24**] anemia.  LE edema improved
   with diuresis.
   - transfuse with prbcs and lasix 40mg IV between units
   - supplemental oxygen
   - TTE
   - holding Captopril/Metoprolol for now, if stops bleeding can restart
   this PM
   - monitor strict i/os
   .
   # CAD:  Pt with CAD s/p STEMI and 3VD with 5 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4401**] placed in [**5-27**].
   Pt reports recent exertional exhaustion but denies chest pain.  This
   could be stable angina, but this is occurring in setting of acute hct
   drop, more likely demand ischemia.  EKG does not show any acute ST-T
   wave changes, will monitor for symptoms
   - continue with prbc transfusions
   - holding Aspirin 81mg given GI bleed, c/s GI about restarting post EGD
   - will restart Metoprolol, Captopril if hct/BP stable in am
   - holding statin until patient tolerating PO
   - am EKGs
   .
   # AFib: Pt with h/o AFib, presenting with GI bleed and INR>4.  Rate
   currently well controlled in 70s.
   - holding coumadin, BB until stops bleeding.
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ETOH: Pt with ETOH history, denies withdrawal but difficult
   historian. Will place on CIWA protocol for now.
   - ativan 1-2mg IV q4 hr prn but did not need overnight.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, chronic low back pain, and a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm. He presented to the emergency department with several days of increasing shortness of breath and exhaustion. He was found to have a drop in hemoglobin from baseline of 40 to 22.8. The patient also had guaiac positive brown stool in the emergency department. He received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was elevated at 4504. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) was 4.5 and he was given a unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K.

The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management and care. In the MICU, he received another unit of PRBCs. His hemoglobin concentration improved to 25.9%. The patient underwent an upper endoscopy last night, which showed likely ulcer bleeding. An ultrasound of his legs revealed no abnormalities.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on"

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, chronic low back pain, and stable abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient presented to the emergency department with increasing shortness of breath, exhaustion, and a significant drop in hematocrit from baseline. He was found to have a positive guaiac test with brown stool, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with vitamin K due to elevated INR. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

24-Hour Events:
- One unit of PRBCs and one unit of FFP with vitamin K were given.
- Hematocrit improved from 22.8% in the emergency department to 25.9% this morning.
- INR decreased from 4.5 to 2.1 with FFP and vitamin K administration.
- The patient received pantoprazole IV for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- Endoscopy is planned to evaluate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD & CHF presents with lower extremity edema &
   acute hct drop likely due to lower GI bleed in setting of elevated INR.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Pt presented with acute hct drop in setting of elevated
   INR, now s/p FFP x 1 and Vitamin K 10mg IV and 2 units PRBCs.  HCT did
   not increase as much as expected ([**3-29**]) but did respond, so this is
   unlikely a brisk GI bleed.  Pt was guaic positive with brown stool,
   etiology of bleed not entirely clear and pt denies any BRBPR/melena,
   nausea/epigastric pain, no prior history GI bleed.  Possible sources
   are a slow upper GI bleed (ulcer vs esophageal varices? ETOH history),
   diverticular bleed.  Slight possibility that thoracic aneurysm is
   bleeding as it has not yet been imaged, but patient is asymptomatic so
   this is unlikely.  Unlikely head, retroperitoneal bleed.   Hemolysis
   remains a possibility.
   - maintain active type & cross
   - transfuse 2u prbcs now with lasix 40mg IV in between
   - 2 x PIVs
   - EGD today, will need FFP for INR <1.5
   - f/u GI recs
   - PPI IV BID
   -image thoracic aneurysm
   -HCT q4h
   -check hemolysis labs

   # CHF: Pt has a history CHF s/p MI with depressed EF that has since
   improved, last echo from [**12-29**] showed EF of 50%. Pt reports acute on
   chronic lower extremity swelling but lungs clear on exam. BNP elevated
   at 4054.  Possible high output failure [**1-24**] anemia.  LE edema improved
   with diuresis.
   - transfuse with prbcs and lasix 40mg IV between units
   - supplemental oxygen
   - TTE
   - holding Captopril/Metoprolol for now, if stops bleeding can restart
   this PM
   - monitor strict i/os

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He presented with lower extremity edema and acute hematocrit drop, indicating possible internal bleeding. The patient has received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion and two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been scheduled to identify the source of bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has experienced a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, as evidenced by the acute hematocrit drop and positive guaiac test. The etiology of the bleed is unclear, with possible sources including an upper GI bleed (such as peptic ulcer or esophageal varices), diverticular bleed, or thoracic aneurysm. The patient is currently receiving FFP and PRBC transfusions to manage the bleeding.

2. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF following a myocardial infarction (MI) with a depressed ejection fraction (EF) that has since improved. His most recent echocardiogram showed an EF of 50%. The patient reports acute-on-chronic lower extremity swelling, but his lungs are clear on examination. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 4054"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with lower extremity edema and acute hematocrit drop. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. The patient has experienced several medical complications including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, atrial fibrillation (AFib), altered mental status, and potential hemolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient presented with acute hematocrit drop in the setting of an elevated INR, suggesting a possible GI bleed. He has received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K, and two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The source of the bleed is unclear, with possibilities including a slow upper GI bleed (ulcer vs. esophageal varices) or diverticular bleed.

2. AFib: The patient has a history of AFib and is currently experiencing a rapid heart rate. His blood pressure remains stable, and he has been given diltiazem and restarted on metoprolol to control the rate.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is obtunded and has difficulty staying awake, making it difficult to assess his mental status accurately.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with acute onset lower extremity edema and a sudden drop in hematocrit (HCT), suggesting a possible lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K intravenously, as well as two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Despite this, the HCT did not increase as expected, indicating that the GI bleed is not actively bleeding.

The patient's mental status has been altered since 6 am, with difficulty staying awake and swallowing pills. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows primary respiratory acidosis, and given the patient's history of COPD, it is likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 92% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. Nebulizers have been started due to the patient's history of COPD and wheezing on examination. A trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been initiated, and intubation may be necessary if the patient is unable to protect the airway or ventilate appropriately.

The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 4054, suggesting possible high-output heart failure secondary to an"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient presented with lower extremity edema and acute hemoglobin drop, likely due to a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). 

The patient received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K intravenously, as well as two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Although the hematocrit (HCT) did not increase as expected, it responded to the treatment, suggesting that this is unlikely a brisk GI bleed. The patient had guaiac positive stool with brown color, and the etiology of the bleed is still unclear. The possible sources of the bleed include a slow upper GI bleed, diverticular bleed, or esophageal varices, given the patient's history of alcohol use. However, the patient denies any bleeding per rectum (BRBPR) or melena, nausea/epigastric pain, and has no prior history of GI bleeding.

The patient's vital signs showed tachycardia with a heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 4 liters nasal cannula. The patient is currently obtunded"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with lower extremity edema and an acute drop in hematocrit (HCT), likely due to a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). 

The patient has received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K intravenously, as well as two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His HCT did not increase as expected, suggesting a non-brisk GI bleed. He is guaiac positive with brown stool, and the etiology of the bleed is unclear. Possible sources include a slow upper GI bleed (ulcer or esophageal varices), diverticular bleed, or thoracic aneurysm. Hemolysis remains a possibility.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 110/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. His lungs are clear on examination, but he has end-expiratory wheezing at the left lung base. He is obtunded and difficult to arouse, with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and an irregularly irregular rhythm. His abdominal"

   Assessment and Plan
   GI bleed; altered MS (somnulant).
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  No evidence for GI bleed.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to GI blood loss, but not clear site of loss.  GI
   plan for EGD in AM, but will depend on respiratory status.  At this
   time would require intubation for procedure.
   A-FIB -- improved control with resuming beta-blocker.
   SOMNULANCE -- attributable to hypercarbia.  Reduce FiO2, maintain SaO2
   >88%.   Trial non-invasive mask ventilation.
   COPD
 COPD exacerbation.  Rx albuteral & atrovent nebulizer; consider
   steroids.  Supplimental O2 to SaO2 88-92%.
   CAD -- check EKG.  At risk for CHF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of anemia and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. They have received four units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) totaling, with the last transfusion given yesterday afternoon. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is around 30%. The patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation (A-fib), which improved with the resumption of beta-blocker medication.

The patient is somnolent this morning, making it difficult to arouse and reliably swallow pills. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, indicating acidosis. The patient has a history of allergies to Plavix (clopidogrel bisulfate), resulting in a rash. They have been on several medications, including furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and metoprolol.

The patient's review of systems is mostly unchanged from admission, with no significant findings in the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary systems. However, the patient has a history of chronic A-fib and is currently on beta-blocker medication.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of dehydration. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/60 mmHg to 140/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of anemia and GI bleed. The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the past 24 hours, with a current hematocrit (Hct) level of approximately 30%. The patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation (A-fib), which improved with the resumption of beta-blocker medication.

The patient is somnulant this morning and has difficulty arousing and swallowing pills. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.32, indicating acidosis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F), heart rate (HR) ranging from 89 to 137 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 126/60 to 140/78 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) ranging from 18 to 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 83%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a face tent and has an ABG showing a PaCO2 of 68 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, and no signs of pallor, scleral edema, or conjunctival pallor. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with no murmurs, and peripheral pulses are present. The respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD & CHF presents with lower extremity edema &
   acute hct drop likely due to lower GI bleed in setting of elevated INR.
   .# GI Bleed: Pt presented with acute hct drop in setting of elevated
   INR, now s/p FFP x 1 and Vitamin K 10mg IV and 2 units PRBCs.  HCT did
   not increase as much as expected ([**3-29**]) but did respond, so this is
   unlikely a brisk GI bleed.  Pt was guaiac positive with brown stool,
   etiology of bleed not entirely clear and pt denies any BRBPR/melena,
   nausea/epigastric pain, no prior history GI bleed.  Possible sources
   are a slow upper GI bleed (ulcer vs esophageal varices? ETOH history),
   diverticular bleed.  Slight possibility that thoracic aneurysm is
   bleeding as it has not yet been imaged, but patient is asymptomatic so
   this is unlikely.  Unlikely head, retroperitoneal bleed.   Hemolysis
   remains a possibility.

   -hemolysis labs: haptoglobin normal, LDH slightly elevated at 269. But
   HCT stable today. Not concerned for hemolysis currently.
   #Altered mental status: ABG shows primary respiratory acidosis. Given
   history of COPD, most likely hypercarbic respiratory failure [**1-24**]. Probably retains CO2 at baseline.
   -decrease O2 to 4L nasal cannula. Titrate to maintain O2 sat between 88
   and 92%.
   -reeval mental status later this morning. Repeat ABG.
   -start nebulizers given h/o COPD and wheezing on exam
   -trial of CPAP
   -if patient is unable to protect airway or ventilate appropriately, may
   need to be intubated. Will closely monitor patient
s mental status and
   Oxygen requirements.
   # CHF: Pt has a history CHF s/p MI with depressed EF that has since
   improved, last echo from [**12-29**] showed EF of 50%. Pt reports acute on
   chronic lower extremity swelling but lungs clear on exam. BNP elevated
   at 4054.  Possible high output failure [**1-24**] anemia.  LE edema improved

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with lower extremity edema and acute hemoglobin drop likely due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient had an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and was treated with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. The patient's hemoglobin level did not increase as expected, indicating a possible slow upper gastrointestinal bleed or diverticular bleed. Other potential sources of bleeding include thoracic aneurysm, but the patient is asymptomatic, making it unlikely. Hemolysis remains a possibility.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, a complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's oxygen requirements will be titrated to maintain oxygen saturation between 88 and 92%. Repeat ABG and reevaluation of mental status are planned.

The patient has a history of CHF secondary to myocardial infarction with improved ejection fraction (EF) of 50%. The patient reports acute on chronic lower extremity swelling, but lung examination is clear. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated, indicating possible high-output heart failure. The patient's leg edema improved with diuretics.

The patient has a history of CAD with a previous STEMI and three-vessel disease. The patient reports recent exertional exhaustion but denies"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, CAD, and CHF. 
- He presented with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and an acute drop in hematocrit (HCT), suggesting a possible lower GI bleed.
- The patient received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K, as well as 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- His HCT did not increase as expected, indicating a slow GI bleed.
- The patient denies any blood in the stool or melena, nausea, or epigastric pain.
- Possible sources of the bleed include a slow upper GI bleed (ulcer or esophageal varices), diverticular bleed, or a thoracic aneurysm.
- Hemolysis remains a possibility, but the patient's HCT is stable, and hemolysis labs show normal haptoglobin levels and slightly elevated LDH.
- The patient's altered mental status has resolved, and he is currently on non-invasive ventilation with a nasal cannula.
- He has a history of CHF post-myocardial infarction with an improved ejection fraction (EF) of 50%.
- The patient reports acute on chronic lower extremity swelling, but his lungs are clear on examination.
- B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated, suggesting possible high-output failure due to anemia.
- The patient's coronary artery disease (CAD) includes a previous STEMI and 3-vessel disease with the placement of a stent on [**5-27**].
- He reports recent exertional exhaustion but denies chest pain, which could be stable angina or demand ischemia.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), presenting with GI bleed and an INR >4.
- His rate is currently well-controlled in the 90s.
- The patient has an alcohol (ETOH) history and is placed on the CIWA protocol.
- He is on a clear liquid diet and will continue to monitor electrolytes with diuresis and replete aggressively.
- The goal fluid balance is negative 500 mL.
- The patient has two large bore peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines.
- He received pneumoboots, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and a bowel regimen.
- The patient is confirmed as FULL code and will be dispositioned in the ICU for now.
- Communication has been made with the patient and son.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient is at risk for ongoing GI bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and multiorgan dysfunction.
2. Hemolysis: Although the patient's hemolysis labs are currently normal, the possibility of hemolysis should be monitored closely due to the acute drop in HCT and elevated LDH levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with PMHx of COPD, CAD & CHF presents with lower extremity
   edema, SOB, & acute hct drop likely due to lower GI bleed in setting of
   elevated INR.
   .# GI Bleed: Pt presented with acute hct drop in setting of elevated
   INR, now s/p FFP x 1 and Vitamin K 10mg IV and 2 units PRBCs.  HCT did
   not increase as much as expected ([**3-29**]) but did respond, so this is
   unlikely a brisk GI bleed.  Pt was guaiac positive with brown stool,
   etiology of bleed not entirely clear and pt denies any BRBPR/melena,
   nausea/epigastric pain, no prior history GI bleed.  Possible sources
   are a slow upper GI bleed (ulcer vs esophageal varices? ETOH history),
   diverticular bleed.  Slight possibility that thoracic aneurysm is
   bleeding as it has not yet been imaged, but patient is asymptomatic so
   this is unlikely.  Unlikely head, retroperitoneal bleed.   Hemolysis
   remains a possibility.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and an acute drop in hematocrit likely due to a lower gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of an elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient has been transfused with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), but his hematocrit did not increase as expected. He is guaiac positive with brown stool, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. The etiology of the bleed is not entirely clear, but possible sources include a slow upper gastrointestinal bleed (such as an ulcer or esophageal varices), diverticular bleed, or a thoracic aneurysm. Hemolysis remains a possibility, and the patient's hemoglobin level is slightly elevated.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, but his oxygen saturations drop to 84% at times even though he is on supplemental oxygen. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation but has shown improvement. An endoscopy procedure (EGD) has been recommended to further investigate the source of the gastrointestinal bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and an acute drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct) likely due to a lower gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). The patient has been treated with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K, as well as two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Despite this, the hct did not increase as expected, suggesting that the gastrointestinal bleed is not actively bleeding. An upper endoscopy (EGD) showed gastritis but no abnormalities in the esophagus or duodenum. The patient has been started on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and will undergo outpatient colonoscopy.

The patient's altered mental status has resolved, and he is now on supplemental oxygen. His heart failure symptoms have improved with diuretics, and he will continue on metoprolol and captopril. The patient's history of alcohol abuse will be monitored, and he will be placed on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) protocol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient may continue to experience gastrointestinal bleeding despite the initial treatment with FFP, vitamin K, and PRBCs. Close monitoring of vital"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and an acute drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) likely due to a lower gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been treated with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His HCT did not increase as expected, suggesting a non-brisk GI bleed.

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, showing gastritis but no abnormalities in the esophagus or duodenum. The patient is prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and is scheduled for an outpatient colonoscopy.

The patient also has altered mental status, which is attributed to hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to his COPD. He has been placed on supplemental oxygen and nebulizers. His COPD management includes tapering prednisone and considering CPAP if he decompensates.

The patient has a history of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 55%. He presented with lower extremity swelling, which improved with diuretics. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 4054. His heart failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing anemia and dyspnea. The patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo and an endoscopy which revealed gastritis. The patient has been agitated at night and has poor quality sleep. The patient has been more awake during the day and removed the nasal cannula, using an open-face mask instead. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98.1Â°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, furosemide, and pantoprazole.

The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for anemia and dyspnea in the respiratory system. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, and the patient appears well-nourished and overweight. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart rhythm with atrial fibrillation, and the respiratory system examination shows clear breath sounds with a prolonged expiratory phase but improved.

The lab results show a low hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, elevated leukocyte count of 155 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 107 mg/dL, and slightly decreased potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L. The WBC count, Hct, and platelet count have been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old overweight male with a chief complaint of anemia and dyspnea. The patient has a history of allergies to Plavix, rash, and previous antibiotics. The patient has been experiencing agitation at night, poor quality sleep, and increased wakefulness. They are currently using an open face mask due to removing the nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving various infusions and medications including fentanyl, midazolam, furosemide, and pantoprazole.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. The patient also reports no gastrointestinal issues like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.

Physical examination shows that the patient is well-nourished, not in acute distress, and overweight. Eyes and conjunctiva are normal without any signs of pallor or edema. The cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds with no murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with prolonged expiratory phase but improved. Skin examination was not performed. Neurologic examination was not assessed.

Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL and elevated white blood cell count at 155 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding) - serial Hct stable.

   78 y/o M with PMHx of COPD, CAD & CHF presents with lower extremity
   edema, SOB, & acute hct drop likely due to lower GI bleed in setting of
   elevated INR.
   .# GI Bleed: Pt presented with acute hct drop in setting of elevated
   INR, now s/p FFP x 1 and Vitamin K 10mg IV and 2 units PRBCs.  HCT did
   not increase as much as expected ([**3-29**]) but did respond, so this is
   unlikely a brisk GI bleed.  Pt was guaiac positive with brown stool,
   etiology of bleed not entirely clear and pt denies any BRBPR/melena,
   nausea/epigastric pain, no prior history GI bleed.
   -EGD shows gastritis. No abnormalities in esophagus or duodenum.  Rec
   starting PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Outpatient colonoscopy.
   -HCT stable > 30.0
   -thoracic aneurysm: currently stable, though more dilated than previous
   ECHO in [**2199-12-23**]
    #Altered mental status: ABG shows primary respiratory acidosis. Given
   history of COPD, most likely hypercarbic respiratory failure [**1-24**]. Probably retains CO2 at baseline.
    -AMS resolved. Currently on 2L O2 nc.  Titrate to maintain O2 sat
   between 88 and 92%.
    #COPD
   -continue nebulizers given h/o COPD. Taper prednisone.
    -if decompensates, trial of CPAP. Currently stable from respiratory
   standpoint.
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Pt has a history CHF s/p MI
   with depressed EF that has since improved, echo shows EF 55%.  Pt
   reports acute on chronic lower extremity swelling but lungs clear on
   exam. BNP elevated at 4054.  LE edema improved with diuresis.
     - supplemental oxygen
currently on 2L nc
   -continue metoprolol and captopril
   - monitor strict i/os
goal negative 500.
   # CAD:  Pt with CAD s/p STEMI and 3VD with 5 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4401**] placed in [**5-27**].
   Pt reports recent exertional exhaustion but denies chest pain.  This
   could be stable angina, but this is occurring in setting of acute hct
   drop, more likely demand ischemia.  EKG does not show any acute ST-T
   wave changes, will monitor for symptoms
   -continue home ASA, Captopril, Metoprolol
   - restart home statin given that he can now take po
   - am EKGs
   # AFib: Pt with h/o AFib, presenting with GI bleed and INR>4.  Rate
   currently well controlled in 90s.  But goes up to 150s - 170s.
   Admission note says patient was on Amiodarone. Unclear if this was just
   prior to hospitalization or in the distant past.  Will confer with son
   and PCP outpatient regimen for afib.
    -Change Lopressor to Toprol XL 75mg qd.
   -continue Coumadin
    - monitor on telemetry
   # ETOH: Pt with ETOH history, denies withdrawal but difficult
   historian. Will place on CIWA protocol for now.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, CAD, and CHF. He presented with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and an acute drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct), likely due to a lower gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of elevated INR. The patient received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K, as well as 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Although the hct did not increase as expected, it responded to the transfusion, suggesting that this is unlikely a brisk GI bleed. The patient's guaiac test was positive with brown stool, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed gastritis without any abnormalities in the esophagus or duodenum. The patient denies any bloody rectal bleeding, nausea, or epigastric pain, and has no prior history of GI bleeding.

The patient's altered mental status resolved after providing supplemental oxygen, and he is currently on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. He will be titrated to maintain oxygen saturation between 88 and 92%. The patient's history of COPD will continue with nebulizers, and prednisone will be tapered. If he decompensates, a trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be considered.

The patient has a history of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction ("

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with PMHx of COPD, CAD & CHF presents with lower extremity
   edema, SOB, & acute hct drop likely due to lower GI bleed in setting of
   elevated INR.
   .# GI Bleed: Pt presented with acute hct drop in setting of elevated
   INR, now s/p FFP x 1 and Vitamin K 10mg IV and 2 units PRBCs.  HCT did
   not increase as much as expected ([**3-29**]) but did respond, so this is
   unlikely a brisk GI bleed.  Pt was guaiac positive with brown stool,
   etiology of bleed not entirely clear and pt denies any BRBPR/melena,
   nausea/epigastric pain, no prior history GI bleed.
   -EGD shows gastritis. No abnormalities in esophagus or duodenum.  Rec
   starting PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Outpatient colonoscopy.
   -HCT stable > 30.0
   -thoracic aneurysm: currently stable, though more dilated than previous
   ECHO in [**2199-12-23**]
    #Altered mental status: ABG shows primary respiratory acidosis. Given
   history of COPD, most likely hypercarbic respiratory failure [**1-24**]. Probably retains CO2 at baseline.
    -AMS resolved. Currently on 2L O2 nc.  Titrate to maintain O2 sat
   between 88 and 92%.
    #COPD
   -continue nebulizers given h/o COPD. Taper prednisone.
    -if decompensates, trial of CPAP. Currently stable from respiratory
   standpoint.
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Pt has a history CHF s/p MI
   with depressed EF that has since improved, echo shows EF 55%.  Pt
   reports acute on chronic lower extremity swelling but lungs clear on
   exam. BNP elevated at 4054.  LE edema improved with diuresis.
     - supplemental oxygen
currently on 2L nc
   -continue metoprolol and captopril
   - monitor strict i/os
goal negative 500.
   # CAD:  Pt with CAD s/p STEMI and 3VD with 5 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4401**] placed in [**5-27**].
   Pt reports recent exertional exhaustion but denies chest pain.  This
   could be stable angina, but this is occurring in setting of acute hct
   drop, more likely demand ischemia.  EKG does not show any acute ST-T
   wave changes, will monitor for symptoms
   -continue home ASA, Captopril, Metoprolol
   - restart home statin given that he can now take po
   - am EKGs
   # AFib: Pt with h/o AFib, presenting with GI bleed and INR>4.  Rate
   currently well controlled in 90s.  But goes up to 150s - 170s.
   Admission note says patient was on Amiodarone. Unclear if this was just
   prior to hospitalization or in the distant past.  Will confer with son
   and PCP outpatient regimen for afib.
    -continue Lopressor 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
   -continue Coumadin
    - monitor on telemetry
   # ETOH: Pt with ETOH history, denies withdrawal but difficult
   historian. Will place on CIWA protocol for now.
    - ativan 1-2mg IV q4 hr prn but hasn
t been needing this at all.
   # FEN: regular diet
   -          monitor lytes with diuresis & replete aggressively
   -          goal fluid balance: negative 500mL
   # Access: 2 large bore PIVs
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and an acute drop in hemoglobin concentration likely due to a lower gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). 

The patient received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K intravenously, as well as two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Despite this, the hematocrit (HCT) did not increase as expected, indicating that the gastrointestinal bleed was not actively bleeding at a brisk rate. The patient's stool guaiac test was positive with brown stool, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed gastritis but no abnormalities in the esophagus or duodenum. The etiology of the bleed is not entirely clear, and the patient denies any black, tarry stools, red blood per rectal bleeding, nausea, or epigastric pain.

The patient's altered mental status resolved after administering supplemental oxygen and adjusting the oxygen saturation target range. His chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is being managed with nebulizers, and there is a plan to taper prednisone. If he decompensates, a trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be considered.
