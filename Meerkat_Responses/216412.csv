   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 39-year-old woman, with history of type I diabetes
   since age 14 months, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants in [**2174**] and
   [**2177**], and a double kidney and pancreas transplant on [**2188-11-20**], who has
   newly diagnosed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma.
   # EBV-Derived CNS Lymphoma
   Identified by biopsy. Being treated per plan by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] and
   [**Name5 (PTitle) 4292**].
   - IV high-dose methotrexate, and leucovorin rescue started on the onc
   floor; we are now alkalinizing urine and initiating CVVH after HD was
   done on the floor
   - check LFTs for hepatoxicity
   - monitor for GI sx, HA, N/V/D, SOB, joint pain, myalgias in the
   setting of high-dose MTX
   - continue leucovorin rescue per heme/onc orders
   - bicarbonate per heme/onc orders
   - antiemetics, supportive care
   .
   # Encephalopathy
   Some of her neurologic impairment may be residual effects of EBV
   meningoencephalitis, but [**Doctor Last Name 10280**] outpatient note suggests more likely
   to be lymphoma effects. Dr.[**Name (NI) 10281**] outpatient note suggests
   prominent features are memory impairment and emotional lability. Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] initial note suggested methylphenidate as a possible aid to
   improved cognition; at this point, agitation while on CVVH/HD has been
   a bigger issue than slowing per report of the floor team, and would
   hold off on a stimulant until this phase is completed.
   .
   # s/p Pancreas-kidney transplant: However, transplanted kidney has
   marginal function but she is still making urine. Estimated creatinine
   clearance has been 20-25 cc/min/m2. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no
   longer an issue.
   - hold CellCept evidently per earlier recs; check in w renal transplant
   re timing of restarting this
   - continue prednisone 4mg daily
   - cont sodium bicarb 1300 PO Q6
   - follow up renal recommendations; renal transplant team is following
   and managing CVVH
   .
   # Hypertension
   - continue Atenolol 100 daily
   - continue amlodipine 5mg daily

","The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants in 2174 and 2177, and a double kidney and pancreas transplant on 2188-11-20. She has newly diagnosed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma. She is currently being treated with IV high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue. 

The patient is experiencing encephalopathy, which may be residual effects of EBV meningoencephalitis or lymphoma effects. Her neurologic impairment includes memory impairment and emotional lability. Agitation while on CVVH/HD has been a bigger issue than cognition, so methylphenidate will be held off until this phase is completed.

The transplanted kidney has marginal function, but the patient is still making urine. Estimated creatinine clearance has been 20-25 cc/min/m2. The pancreas is working fine, and diabetes is no longer an issue. CellCept will be held per earlier recommendations, and prednisone will be continued at 4mg daily. Sodium bicarb will be continued at 1300 PO Q6.

The patient also has hypertension, for which she is taking atenolol 100 daily and amlodipine 5mg daily.

In ICU care, the patient is receiving full nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and V"

The patient is currently being treated with IV high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue, urine alkalinization, and continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) after hemodialysis (HD) was done on the floor.

The patient also has encephalopathy, which may be residual effects of EBV meningoencephalitis or due to lymphoma effects. Memory impairment and emotional lability are prominent features. Methylphenidate has been suggested as a possible aid to improved cognition, but due to agitation while on CVVH/HD, it is being held off for now.

The transplanted kidney has marginal function, but the patient is still producing urine. Estimated creatinine clearance has been 20-25 cc/min/m2. The pancreas is working fine, and diabetes is no longer an issue. CellCept has been held, and prednisone 4mg daily is being continued. Sodium bicarb 1300 PO Q6 is also being continued. Renal transplant recommendations are being followed up with the renal transplant team, who"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with Type I diabetes mellitus who has undergone three renal transplants and one pancreatic transplant. She is currently in the ICU for maintenance of CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) therapy in the setting of renal transplant. The patient has been diagnosed with CNS lymphoma, which is complicated by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. She is undergoing methotrexate (MTX) treatment.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to the transplants and MTX treatment increases the risk of infections.
2. Bleeding: The use of anticoagulant therapy (SQ UF Heparin) for DVT prophylaxis may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Fluid imbalance: The flow sheet data shows an ongoing fluid imbalance, indicating the need for careful monitoring and management of fluid intake and output.
4. Hypoglycemia: Given the patient's history of Type I DM, close monitoring and management of glycemic control is necessary, especially during CVVH therapy.
5. Thrombosis: The presence of right and left radial pulses not assessed suggests a potential risk for thrombosis in the upper extremities.
6. Poor nutritional status: The patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored, considering her prolonged ICU stay and ongoing medical complications.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored"

   # EBV-Derived CNS Lymphoma: Identified by biopsy. Being treated per
   plan by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4292**].
   - IV high-dose methotrexate, and leucovorin rescue started on the onc
   floor; we are now alkalinizing urine and initiating CVVH after HD was
   done on the floor
   - monitor for GI sx, elevated LFTs, HA, N/V/D, SOB, joint pain,
   myalgias in the setting of high-dose MTX
   - continue leucovorin rescue per heme/onc orders
   - continue cvvh
   - d/c bicarbonate
   - antiemetics, supportive care
   - goal urine pH>7.5
   - check pm methotrexate level, can d/c pt if MTX<0.1
   .
   # Elevated LFT: LFT higher today compared to [**8-14**]. most likely
   secondary to methotrexate. Pt is hepatitis C positive since [**2185**]. [**Last Name (un) **]
   and B neg. Unclear if pt was ever treated for hepC.
   - increase leucovorin dose per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**]
   - continue to monitor
   - will need to get hep C viral load checked as outpatient
   - If continues to rise, RUQ US to rule out cholecystitis or liver
   pathology
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Some of her neurologic impairment may be residual
   effects of EBV meningoencephalitis, but [**Doctor Last Name 10280**] outpatient note
   suggests more likely to be lymphoma effects. Dr.[**Name (NI) 10281**] outpatient
   note suggests prominent features are memory impairment and emotional
   lability. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] initial note suggested methylphenidate as a possible
   aid to improved cognition; at this point, agitation while on CVVH/HD
   has been a bigger issue than slowing per report of the floor team, and
   would hold off on a stimulant until this phase is completed.
   - continue to monitor mental status regularly
   .
   # s/p Pancreas-kidney transplant: transplanted kidney has marginal
   function but she is still making urine. Estimated creatinine clearance
   has been 20-25 cc/min/m2. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no longer an
   issue.
   - hold MMF if WBC <3.0, otherwise on discharge restart MMF at 500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue prednisone 4mg daily
   - d/c sodium bicarb 1300 PO Q6
   - follow up renal recommendations; renal transplant team is following
   and managing CVVH
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue Atenolol 100 daily
   - continue amlodipine 5mg daily
   .
   # Type I DM: s/p kidney / pancreas double transplant. DM not an issue
   any more
   - not on ISS, and glucose wnl

The patient is currently being treated with high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue for the lymphoma. She is also undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to renal insufficiency and ongoing management of her hypertension and type I diabetes.

Her neurological examination shows mild alopecia, and her abdomen is described as normoactive with bowel sounds.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 378 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, platelet count of 108 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal range.

The patient's medical complications include elevated liver function tests likely secondary to methotrexate treatment, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with lymphoma. There are conflicting recommendations between the renal and oncology teams regarding the continuation of CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and MTX (methotrexate) levels. The renal team suggests stopping CVVH when MTX level is less than 1, while the oncology team recommends stopping at an MTX level of less than 0.1. The renal team also suggests running even I/O (input/output), but the oncology team wants to run negative. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/82 to 165/136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has allergies to ampicillin, penicillins, and morphine. The patient's weight is currently 55 kg, and their height is 61 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 5311 mL and total output of 6054 mL. The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 378 K/uL, low hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, low platelet count of 108 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes,"

   - renal and onc had conflicting recs: renal wants to stop CVVH when MTX
   level <1, onc wants <0.1. Renal is thinking about long-session HD for
   next time but onc wants elective [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] admission next time. renal wanted
   to run even I/O, but onc wants to run negative.
   - renal recs: cont CVVH, check MTX level at 3am. If <0.1, can stop
   CVVH. check CBC lytes and VBG. replete phos with K phos 30mM. hold MMF
   if WBC <3.0, otherwise on discharge restart MMF at 500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - onc recs: if MTX <0.1, can stop CVVH. wondering if pt can be
   electively admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] next time for CVVH. pt can be d/c'd home
   directly from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] when not requiring CVVH
   - cvvh continued as MTX level was 2.61
   - urine ph has been above 7.5
   - pt was teary eyed and anxious all night, relieved somewhat by ativan

   The patient is a 39-year-old woman, with history of type I diabetes
   since age 14 months, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants in [**2174**] and
   [**2177**], and a double kidney and pancreas transplant on [**2188-11-20**], who has
   newly diagnosed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma.
   # EBV-Derived CNS Lymphoma: Identified by biopsy. Being treated per
   plan by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4292**].
   - IV high-dose methotrexate, and leucovorin rescue started on the onc
   floor; we are now alkalinizing urine and initiating CVVH after HD was
   done on the floor
   - check LFTs for hepatoxicity
   - monitor for GI sx, HA, N/V/D, SOB, joint pain, myalgias in the
   setting of high-dose MTX
   - continue leucovorin rescue per heme/onc orders
   - bicarbonate per heme/onc orders
   - antiemetics, supportive care
   .
   # Elevated LFT: LFT higher today compared to [**8-14**]. most likely
   secondary to methotrexate. Pt is hepatitis C positive since [**2185**]. [**Last Name (un) **]
   and B neg. Unclear if pt was ever treated for hepC.
   - continue to monitor
   - If continues to rise, RUQ US to rule out cholecystitis or liver
   pathology
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Some of her neurologic impairment may be residual
   effects of EBV meningoencephalitis, but [**Doctor Last Name 10280**] outpatient note
   suggests more likely to be lymphoma effects. Dr.[**Name (NI) 10281**] outpatient
   note suggests prominent features are memory impairment and emotional
   lability. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] initial note suggested methylphenidate as a possible
   aid to improved cognition; at this point, agitation while on CVVH/HD
   has been a bigger issue than slowing per report of the floor team, and
   would hold off on a stimulant until this phase is completed.
   .
   # s/p Pancreas-kidney transplant: However, transplanted kidney has
   marginal function but she is still making urine. Estimated creatinine
   clearance has been 20-25 cc/min/m2. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no
   longer an issue.
   - hold MMF if WBC <3.0, otherwise on discharge restart MMF at 500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue prednisone 4mg daily
   - d/c sodium bicarb 1300 PO Q6
   - follow up renal recommendations; renal transplant team is following
   and managing CVVH
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue Atenolol 100 daily
   - continue amlodipine 5mg daily
   .
   # Anxiety:
   - ativan prn
   - SW consult if pt stays today

","The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants in 2014 and 2017, and a double kidney and pancreas transplant on 11/20/1988. She has been diagnosed with EBV-driven CNS lymphoma. 

The patient is currently receiving high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue, as well as CVVH after HD. She is also being monitored for potential side effects of high-dose methotrexate such as hepatoxicity, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, joint pain, and myalgias.

The patient's elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are likely secondary to methotrexate. She is hepatitis C positive since 1985 and has an unknown treatment history for hepC. Her ongoing LFTs should be closely monitored, and if they continue to rise, a RUQ US should be performed to rule out cholecystitis or liver pathology.

The patient's neurologic impairment may be residual effects of EBV meningoencephalitis, but it could also be due to lymphoma effects. The use of methylphenidate as a possible aid to improved cognition has been considered, but at this point, agitation while on CVVH/HD has been a bigger issue.
