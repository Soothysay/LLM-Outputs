","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) x 2. He presents with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone. The patient also has profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has now stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

The patient has been diagnosed with endocarditis, likely due to an embolic phenomenon to the left foot and possible abscess in the fibrous trigone. He also has numbness in the left lower extremity. The source of the enterococcus bacteremia is suspected to be a dental filling replacement procedure that the patient had, despite taking antibiotics. The patient denies intravenous drug use (IVDU), but it is considered as a possible source given his history.

The patient's aortic valve replacement is also mentioned, with dehiscence of the aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. However, the patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient has anemia, most likely due to ongoing hemolysis. The cause of this hemolysis is uncertain, but it may be related to the valvular damage or another underlying cause. Additionally, there is a possibility of"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: This note is entered and signed on
   the day after the actual service was performed by me, due to computer
   lockout yesterday.  [**Known firstname 3987**] is stable.  He has aortic root abscess at
   the right fibrous trigone involving the confluence of the anterior
   mitral leaflet and posterior aortic root.  He has had embolic events
   but none recently so I think he is stable from that standpoint.  He
   does not have any large valvular vegetations, and aside freom mild
   paravalvular aortic regurgitation, no major hemodynamically
   compromising valve dysfunction (other than the hemolysis, obviously).
   He aslo has an anastamotic pseudoanerysm at the distal site of the
   aortic graft, which I also think is stable.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone. The patient also has profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has now stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of recurrent endocarditis, and there is a likely embolic phenomenon to the left foot and left eye, as well as possible abscess in the fibrous trigone. This increases the risk of further embolic events and potential spread of infection.

2. Aortic valve dehiscence: The patient has a dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. This increases the risk of valve dysfunction and potential complications such as heart failure or recurrent endocarditis.

3. Hemolytic anemia: The patient is experiencing profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and anemia-related complications.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has an increase in creatinine from baseline, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and two previous aortic valve replacements. He presented with enterococcal bacteremia, leading to the dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but has numbness in the left lower extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of recurrent endocarditis, which increases the risk of embolic phenomena to the left foot and possible abscess in the fibrous trigone.
2. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient has a dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. This could lead to further complications if not addressed.
3. Anemia: The patient is experiencing profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage. Close monitoring and appropriate transfusion therapy will be necessary.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: Although the cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries, the patient had a troponin leak of 0.37, which may indicate demand ischemia secondary to profound anemia. Monitoring for signs of acute ischemia and considering transfusion therapy if Hct falls below 21 will be important.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has an increased creatinine level from baseline, likely due to a pre-renal et"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone. The patient also has profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has now stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but complains of numbness in the left lower extremity. There is a concern for possible abscess in the fibrous trigone, likely due to embolic phenomena from enterococcal bacteremia. The patient's dental filling replacement in [Month 1563] may have been the source of the bacteremia, despite taking antibiotics. The patient denies intravenous drug use (IVDU) but has a history of IVDU prior to his second surgery in [2139]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of recurrent endocarditis, and there is evidence of possible abscess formation in the fibrous trigone. This increases the risk of further embolic events and potential septic emboli leading to organ damage.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) presenting with enterococcal bacteremia. The patient experienced dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone and profound hemolytic anemia, which has now stabilized. The likely source of the enterococcus bacteremia is a dental procedure the patient underwent. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but complains of numbness in the left lower extremity, which may indicate potential embolic phenomena to the L foot.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: There is a risk of further embolic phenomena to other organs, such as the brain, given the patient's history of enterococcal bacteremia and possible abscess in the fibrous trigone.
2. Aortic Valve Replacement: The dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone requires close monitoring, and surgical intervention may be necessary to correct the issue.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemolytic anemia needs to be closely monitored for any signs of exacerbation or new bleeding events.
4. Suspected L foot embolic disease: The numbness in the left lower extremity suggests possible embolic disease in the left foot. Continuous monitoring for signs of abscess formation is required.
5. Coronaries: Although the cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries"

   ICU Care
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and two previous aortic valve replacements. He presented with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone and subsequent profound hemolytic anemia. 

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but complains of numbness in his left lower extremity. He has likely experienced embolic phenomena to his left foot and left eye, as well as a possible abscess in the fibrous trigone. 

The source of his enterococcus bacteremia is believed to be a recent dental filling replacement procedure, despite taking antibiotics. 

The patient's anemia has stabilized, but further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause. 

His cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries, but there was a troponin leak of 0.37, which is likely due to demand ischemia secondary to profound anemia. 

The patient has a history of intravenous drug use but denies using it since his second surgery in [**2139**]. He is currently on suboxone and will be referred for substance abuse support. 

His previous medical history includes congestive heart failure prior to the aortic valve replacement (SEVERE AI), but now he shows no signs of fluid overload. His"

   -Hold carvidolol and warfarin
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality. [**Month (only) 60**] consider CABG at
   the same time of replacement if coronaries are damaged
will need
   coronary cath
   #Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic.
   - CT aorta r/o aortoenteric fistula
   - retic count in am pending
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the AVR ring/right fibrous trigone. He also has profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has now stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to the left foot and left eye, coronary artery, and possible abscess in the fibrous trigone.
2. Aortic valve replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. The patient is hemodynamically stable.
3. Anemia: Most likely 3-12 hemolysis though? Whether the pt. had some GI bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherapeutic.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   #Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye Coronary
   artery and possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   ---He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity. PICC placed yesterday.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 2)
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - MRI of Brain to rule out acute event; full report pending
   - Panorex pending to assess for infectious process in mouth. Dental
   consult will be by today at 4pm.
   #Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery pending
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs.
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70. Reducing sheer force.
   -Change Heparin gtt to coumadin 5 mg daily
   -Hold carvidolol and warfarin
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality. [**Month (only) 60**] consider CABG at
   the same time of replacement if coronaries are damaged
will need
   coronary cath
   #Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   r/o aortoenteric fistula;
   --- Hct down from 29.8 to 26.4 today. Patient bled with PICC line
   placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP elevated;
   likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active inflammatory
   state
 cannot r/o hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Will check Hct again this evening.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress
   - Tx Hct <25 as Hx CAD
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses [**Hospital1 **]
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE

   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID
   -Will touch base with addiction to verify no titration needed to reach
   home dose.
   -SW consult for support pending
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology pending
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient presents with enterococcal bacteremia, which has led to dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring and right fibrous trigone. He also has profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Endocarditis: The patient likely has endocarditis, as evidenced by the presence of an abscess in the fibrous trigone and embolic phenomena to the left foot and eye. Dental filling replacement is suspected as the source of enterococcal bacteremia.
2. Aortic valve replacement dehiscence: The patient's aortic valve replacement ring has dehisced due to a lost stitch.
3. Hemolytic anemia: The patient has profound hemolytic anemia, possibly due to valvular damage. The anemia has stabilized after receiving PRBC.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has new wall motion abnormality on TTE, which may indicate embolic disease in the coronaries. He also had a troponin I elevation in the past.

   - MRI: Read pending
   - ECHO: (Summary) Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2141-11-27**], the septum is now hypokinetic. The aortic root
   abscess/dehiscence with associated paravalvular regurgitation is now
   present.
   - CXR: (Wet Read) PICC terminates in SVC, Cardiomegaly, no acute
   cardiopulmonary process.
   - Blood/Urine cultures pending
   - MRA: No evidence of aneurysms in the major intracranial arteries.
   However, MRA is not sensitive for small mycotic aneurysms, which may
   occur more peripherally. Head MRI with and without contrast may be
   useful if intracranial infection is suspected.
   - CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1. Post-surgical changes with aortic graft and
   aortic valve prosthesis. 2. Ascending aorta measures up to 5.9 cm in
   diameter. 3. Cardiomegaly. 4. Small left pleural effusion. 5. Left
   basilar consolidation/atelectasis. 6. Splenomegaly. 7. Small amount of
   free fluid in the pelvis. 8. No CT evidence for aortoenteric fistula.
   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye Coronary
   artery and possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity. PICC placed yesterday.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 2)
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - MRI of Brain to rule out acute event; full report pending
   - Panorex (dental films) pending to assess for infectious process in
   mouth. Dental consult will be by today at 4pm.
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery pending
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs.
   -Increase Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Change Heparin gtt to coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue this
   coumadin for a few days and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula.
   - Hct down from 29.8 to 26.4 today. Patient bled with PICC line
   placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP elevated;
   likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active inflammatory
   state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated.
   - Will check Hct again this evening.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - Will get MRA of left foot today
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID
   -Will touch base with addiction to verify no titration needed to reach
   home dose.
   -SW consult for support pending
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology pending
   - Will also ask addiction about appropriate pain control
   post-operatively
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient with an increase of creatinine from
   baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, on presentation here, 1.2. Today Cr
   1.0 and continues to improve. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and
   hypotensive state in OSH.
   -Will follow with BMP
   -Caution with renally cleared drugs

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the aortic valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone. The patient has profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has now stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient is likely experiencing embolic phenomena to the left foot and eye, coronary artery, and possible abscess in the fibrous trigone. Dental filling replacement may be the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
2. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient has a dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. This may require surgical intervention.
3. Anemia: The patient is experiencing most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis, possibly exacerbated by GI bleed. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
4. L foot embolic disease: The patient's left foot appears warm and well perfused currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on the left. ABI shows severe left tibial disease. Intervention may be necessary.
5. Coronaries: The patient has a new wall motion abnormality on TTE concerning for emboli in the coronary arteries."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye Coronary
   artery and possible abscess in fibrous trigone. Patient with dental
   filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even though patient took antibiotics, he
   started to feel increasingly tired some time after this procedure.
   Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely the dental procedure is the
   source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity. PICC placed yesterday.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 2)
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - MRI of Brain to rule out acute event; full report pending
   - Panorex (dental films) pending to assess for infectious process in
   mouth. Dental consult will be by today at 4pm.
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli

   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery pending
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs.
   -Increase Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Change Heparin gtt to coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue this
   coumadin for a few days and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula.
   - Hct down from 29.8 to 26.4 today. Patient bled with PICC line
   placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP elevated;
   likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active inflammatory
   state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated.
   - Will check Hct again this evening.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - Will get MRA of left foot today

   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID
   -Will touch base with addiction to verify no titration needed to reach
   home dose.
   -SW consult for support pending
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology pending
   - Will also ask addiction about appropriate pain control
   post-operatively

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: [**Known firstname 3987**] is clinically and
   hemodynamically stable.  He is receiving dual antibiotic therapy for
   his Enterococcal endocarditis.  His Hct is drifting down,
   unsurprisingly.  We have thoroughly reviewed his CT scans, MRI, MRA,
   TTE, and transthoracic echo with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5648**], and CCU and CT surgery
   teams.  Infectious Disease team indicating that a total of two weeks
   duration of antibiotics prior to surgery mauy be optimal, with plans to
   continue antibiotics both during and after surgery.  Therefore,
   anticipated surgery will likel;y occur next week, and we will keep

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who is currently admitted to the ICU for enterococcal bacteremia and a dehiscent aortic valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone. The patient is hemodynamically stable and receiving dual antibiotic therapy.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, severe aortic insufficiency, and previous use of intravenous drugs (IVDU). He is currently on suboxone for outpatient management of IVDU and will be started on suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today.

The patient's recent laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 26.4 g/dL, which is down from 29.8 g/dL, indicating possible hemolysis. Other lab results include elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting an active inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia.

Imaging studies reveal a new wall motion abnormality on TTE concerning for septic emboli, aortic root abscess/dehiscence with associated paravalvular regurgitation, and aortic valve prosthesis with no evidence of aneurysms in the major intr"

   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot and L eye, Coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone and Ampicllin per ID recs (Day 3); given
   per PICC
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery: prefer to be within 15 days of patient
   presentation
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs. Surgery Date pending
   -Continue Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Continue coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue coumadin for a few days
   and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID;
   currently [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
   -[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] will come by today to help with management of subxone
   and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, today is
   0.9. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and hypotensive state in OSH.
   Essentially resolved.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the AVR ring/right fibrous trigone. The patient has profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has now stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient's condition is complicated by likely embolic phenomena to the left foot and left eye, coronary artery involvement, possible abscess in the fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and left cerebellum. 

The patient's medical history includes dental filling replacement, which may be the source of his enterococcus bacteremia, and intravenous drug use (IVDU), although he denies current use. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and is being treated with ceftriaxone and ampicillin per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations. Blood cultures and urinalysis are pending. 

The patient's aortic valve replacement is complicated by a dehiscent valve in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. ID recommendations suggest surgery within 15 days of presentation. A computed tomography (CT) scan is pending. 

The patient has anemia, likely due to hemolysis or possible GI bleed. The reticulocyte count has"

   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC. Clinically stable.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone (Day 3) and Ampicllin (Day 3 at [**Hospital1 54**]) per
   ID recs; given per PICC

   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery: prefer to be within 15 days of patient
   presentation
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs. Surgery Date pending
   -Continue Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Continue coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue coumadin for a few days
   and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC. Clinically stable.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone (Day 3) and Ampicllin (Day 3 at [**Hospital1 54**]) per
   ID recs; given per PICC
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery: prefer to be within 15 days of patient
   presentation
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs. Surgery Date pending
   -Continue Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Continue coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue coumadin for a few days
   and then stop prior to surgery
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
   - Will likely need an intervention, but timing will be addressed per
   consult as patient has concurrent active infectious process
   - Follow pulses daily
   CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did have
   a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall motion
   abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID;
   currently [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
   -[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] will come by today to help with management of subxone
   and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, today is
   0.9. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and hypotensive state in OSH.
   Essentially resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the AVR ring/right fibrous trigone. The patient also has profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has now stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has been started on ceftriaxone and ampicillin per ID recommendations. The source of the enterococcus bacteremia is likely the recent dental filling replacement, despite taking antibiotics. The patient denies intravenous drug use (IVDU), but surveillance TTE on Monday will be helpful in assessing for septic emboli.

Aortic valve replacement: The patient has a dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. ID recommendations for surgery time prefer to be within 15 days of patient presentation. CT surgery is following and appreciates recommendations. Surgery date is pending. The patient is on metoprolol to keep HR < 70 to reduce sheer force. Coumadin will continue for a few days and then stopped prior to surgery.

Anemia: The patient's anemia is most likely due to hemolysis, although it is unclear whether there was some GI bleed as dyspnea got acutely"

   PROXIMALLY OCCLUDED, RECONSTITUTES MID CALF.
   EKG: TWI V2/V3, ST depressions in V2-V6, RBBB
   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo with h/o aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, AVR x 2
   presenting with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of aortic
   valve replacement ring/right fibrous trigone, in the setting of
   profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, that has now
   stabilized s/p 10 units PRBC. Clinically stable.
   .
   # Endocarditis: Likely embolic phenomena to L foot, L eye, coronary
   artery, possible abscess in fibrous trigone, cerebral hemispheres, and
   left cerebellum. Patient with dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], even
   though patient took antibiotics, he started to feel increasingly tired
   some time after this procedure. Since patient denies IVDU, it is likely
   the dental procedure is the source of his enterococcus bacteremia.
   - He is currently hemodynamically stable. Avoiding gentamicin given Hx
   of ototoxicity.
   - ID Consulting and appreciate recs
   - Will continue Ceftriaxone (Day 3) and Ampicllin (Day 3 at [**Hospital1 54**]) per
   ID recs; given per PICC
   - BCx/UCx pending
   - Panorex (dental films) negative for infectious process in mouth.
   - Continue physical exam and lab data suspicious for septic emboli
   - Surveillance TTE on Monday
   # Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient with dehiscent aortic valve in the
   right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. Patient
   hemodynamicaly stable.
   - ID recs for time of surgery: prefer to be within 15 days of patient
   presentation
   -CT surgery following and appreciate recs. Surgery Date pending
   -Continue Metoprolol to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] to keep HR < 70 in order to reduce
   sheer force.
   -Continue coumadin 5 mg daily
 will continue coumadin for a few days
   and then stop on Sunday (last dose Saturday evening)
   -Hold carvedilol
   -TTE report shows a new wall motion abnormality
 likely septic emboli
   to septal perforator branch that would be difficult to bypass
   -CT surgery may end up doing CABG at the same time as AVR, as currently
   coronaries are implanted into aortic graft
   # Anemia: Most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though ? whether pt. had some GI
   bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was
   inappropriate to chronic process and INR was supratherpeutic. CT aorta
   ruled out aortoenteric fistula. Anemia likely due to patient bleed with
   PICC line placement and Retic count 3.1-> Retic index 1.5; ESR and CRP
   elevated; likely secondary to marrow suppression from an active
   inflammatory state or hemolytic anemia as LDH was markedly elevated
   - Hct stable at 26.6 today. Hemolytic anemia with marrow suppression
   secondary to infectious state is likely cause.
   - Will check Hct again daily.
   - Metoprolol to decrease shear stress.
   - Will transfuse for Hct <21
   # L foot embolic disease: Foot appears warm and well perfused
   currently, although DP/PT pulses are decreased on left. ABI shows
   severe left tibial disease. Patient stable.
   - MRA of left foot shows occlusive arteries
   - Vascular/Interventional following and appreciate recs
 will monitor
   at this point, no intervention at this time
   - Follow pulses daily
   #CORONARIES: Cardiac Cath [**3-17**] showed clean coronaries. Patient did
   have a troponin I elevation of 0.37 in OSH. Patient with new wall
   motion abnormality on TTE
concerning for emoboli in the coronaries..
   - Consider CABG at same time of AVR
will d/w CT surgery
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of acute ischemia
   - Monitor Hct daily Transfuse <21
   .
   #Hx of IVDU: Patient states he has not used IVDU since prior to his
   second surgery in [**2139**]. Patient on suboxone in outpatient;
   -Will start suboxone (0.5 8mg/2mg) today; home dose is 0.5 tab TID;
   currently [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
   -[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2446**] will come by today to help with management of subxone
   and guidelines regarding pain management in the post-op period
   -Continue to monitor for signs of active heroin withdrawal
   - Hepatitis C serology negative
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o of CHF prior to AVR (SEVERE AI). Now, patient
   with no signs of fluid overload; EF on TTE in  [**2141-11-27**] (after AVR) was
   > 55% with normal filling pressures PCWP < 12. New echo shows 1+ MR,
   (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation is seen. LVEF 50-55%.
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in NSR.
   -Will continue to monitor on telemetry for signs of AV block
    # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  baseline of 0.8. OSH peaked at 1.9, today is
   0.9. Likely due to pre-renal etiology and hypotensive state in OSH.
   Essentially resolved.
   -Will follow with morning BMP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of aortic valvuloplasty, recurrent endocarditis, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with enterococcal bacteremia causing dehiscence of the AVR ring/right fibrous trigone. He has profound hemolytic anemia secondary to valvular damage, which has now stabilized after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient likely has embolic phenomena to the left foot, left eye, coronary artery, and possible abscess in the fibrous trigone, as well as cerebral hemispheres and left cerebellum. The source of infection is suspected to be a dental filling replacement in [**Month (only) 1563**], despite taking antibiotics.

2. Aortic Valve Replacement: There is a dehiscent aortic valve in the right fibrous trigone, likely due to a lost stitch. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

3. Anemia: The patient has most likely [**3-12**] hemolysis though? whether pt. had some GI bleed as dyspnea got acutely worse, retic count at OSH was inappropriate to chronic process, and INR was supratherpeutic. A CT aorta ruled out aortoenteric fist"
