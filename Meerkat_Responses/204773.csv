   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 70 year-old female with a history of diastolic
   heart failure, CKD who presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia
   and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory distress:  Most likely secondary to CHF.  Currently
   stable on nitroglycerin gtt, NIPPV, and furosemide.  Most likely
   precipitant is cessation of diuretics, and unclear if renal failure
   preceded this or is a result. Other possibility is evolving pneumonia
   given RLL infiltrate on CXR and leukocytosis.  Fluid balance will be
   challenging due to cardio-renal syndrome, underlying chronic kidney
   disease.  Will need to monitor urine output closely to ensure she is
   responding to furosemide.
   - ECG on admission
   - Continue rule-out MI with 3 sets CE's
   - NPO in case needs intubation, also on bipap
   - Continue nitroglycerin gtt, maximize afterload reduction - can give
   nifedipine in the hope to titrate off the nitro gtt.
   - NIPPV as long as tolerating
   - Bolus furosemide for I/O -1500/1000cc q24h
   - continue statin, beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], afterload reduction
   - sputum culture
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely pre-renal [**12-29**] poor forward flow, baseline
   creatinine in the low 3's, currently 4.5. that being said, unable to
   know clearly whether renal function worsened as primary precipitant for
   heart failure secondary to volume overload. Monitor response of
   creatinine to diuresis.
   - place foley
   - strict I/O
   - UA/urine culture to r/o infection
   .
   # NG Metabolic Acidosis with Compensatory Respiratory Alkalosis:
   Metabolic acidosis is likely in the setting of renal failure, but
   underlying etiology of this is unclear as discussed above.
   - urine lytes to calculate FeUrea (given lasix)
   .
   # Mild Leukocytosis:  Unclear etiology.  No history of localizing
   symptoms. RLL infiltrate could be evolving pneumonia and also in acute
   on chronic renal failure which could be secondary to UTI. Currently
   afebrile.
   - sputum cx if obtainable
   - UA/urine cx
   - monitor wbc and fever curve
   - no abx for now
   .
   # DM2: insulin sliding scale while NPO. Once eating can resume standing
   Humalin dosing as she takes at home.
   .
   # HTN: Continue metoprolol, nifedipine. Currently on nitro gtt but can
   attempt to wean as diuresis is effective. Afterload reduction is very
   important to encourage forward flow. Unfortunately, need to avoid ACEI
   given renal failure.
   .
   # S/p CVA: continue aspirin
   .
   # FEN: I/O goal of negative 1 to 1.5L today with lasix. Monitor strict
   UOP. Replete lytes prn. NPO for now, but if stabilized can start low
   salt heart healthy diabetic renal diet.
   .
   # Access: PIV's
   .
   # PPx: heparin subcut
   .
   # Code: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU until clinically stabilized

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. She presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia, indicating an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV), nitroglycerin, and furosemide.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is most likely secondary to CHF. It is currently stable on nitroglycerin, NIPPV, and furosemide. Monitoring the patient's response to these treatments will be important.

2. Evolving pneumonia: The presence of RLL infiltrate on the chest X-ray and leukocytosis raises the possibility of evolving pneumonia. Further evaluation with sputum culture and CX may be necessary to rule out this complication.

3. Cardio-renal syndrome: The patient's underlying chronic kidney disease and the current presentation suggest a challenging fluid balance due to cardio-renal syndrome. Close monitoring of urine output is crucial to ensure the patient's response to furosemide.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine is in the low 3's, and currently, it is 4.5, indicating a possible worsening of renal function. Monitoring the response of creatinine to diuresis will be important.

5. Metabolic acidosis:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, presenting with shortness of breath and hypoxia. The patient has acute on chronic renal failure and is currently experiencing respiratory distress, which is most likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is stable on nitroglycerin, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and furosemide. The precipitant of CHF is unclear, but it may be related to the cessation of diuretics. Other possibilities include evolving pneumonia given the right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and leukocytosis.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient is currently stable on nitroglycerin, NIPPV, and furosemide. It is important to monitor the patient's response to these treatments and ensure adequate oxygenation.
2. ECG changes: The patient's ECG on admission should be reviewed, and further investigations such as cardiac enzymes should be considered to rule out myocardial infarction (MI).
3. Fluid balance: Due to cardio-renal syndrome and underlying chronic kidney disease, monitoring urine output closely is crucial to ensure the patient is responding to furosemide.
4. Renal failure: The patient has likely pre-renal renal failure due to poor forward flow, with a baseline creatinine in the low 3's and currently at 4.5. It"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/54 mmHg to 129/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP.

The patient's physical examination reveals alertness, awake, and comfortable breathing in bed. She has a positive fluid balance of -1,949 mL since 12 AM, indicating fluid removal. The patient also has bibasilar crackles in the lungs, soft abdomen with no distention or tenderness, and 1-2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count of 185 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 158 mg/dL, creatinine of 4.7 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, chloride of 85 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 19 mEq/L, glucose of 158 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.03 ng/mL. Imaging reveals no evidence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's plan includes respiratory distress management with NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation), IV lasix for hypoxia and dyspnea, statin therapy, beta-blocker therapy, and afterload reduction. Renal failure management involves monitoring the response of creatinine to diuresis, placing a foley catheter, strict intake/output measurements, and urine culture to rule out infection. Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis is also noted, and mild leukocytosis requires further investigation.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She is currently on a nitroglycerin drip, which can be weaned off as diuresis is effective. Afterload reduction is important to encourage forward flow, but ACE inhibitors are contraindicated due to renal failure. The patient's diet will be advanced if oxygen saturation allows, and strict fluid balance will be maintained with a goal of negative 1 to 1.5 L today with lasix. Repletion of electrolytes will be done as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 70 year-old female with a history of diastolic
   heart failure, CKD who presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia
   and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory distress:  Likely secondary to CHF.  Good diuresis with
   IV lasix.  Most likely precipitant is cessation of diuretics, and
   unclear if renal failure preceded this or is a result. Other
   possibility is evolving pneumonia given RLL infiltrate on CXR and
   leukocytosis.  Fluid balance will be challenging due to cardio-renal
   syndrome, underlying chronic kidney disease.  Question underlying
   pulmonary process besides pulmonary overload [**12-29**] CHF.
   - Will check CT chest without contrast to  eval for possible underlying
   pulmonary pathology
   - CE negative x 2
   - Will try to advance diet today if pt
s O2 sats tolerate being off
   face mask
   - Continue Lasix IV PRN hypoxia/ dypsnea. Will try to limit if
   possible, as pt already 2L negative today.
   - Titrate O2 down as tolerated.
   - NIPPV as long as tolerating.
   - continue statin, beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], nifedipine, afterload reduction
   - Obtain sputum culture
   - Will start Vancomycin IV  (Day 1) and Levaquin (Day 1)empirically for
   presumed PNA
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely pre-renal [**12-29**] poor forward flow, baseline
   creatinine in the low 3's, currently 5.2. that being said, unable to
   know clearly whether renal function worsened as primary precipitant for
   heart failure secondary to volume overload. Cr has not improved despite
   adequate diuresis, suggesting an underlying renal dysfunction.Monitor
   response of creatinine to diuresis.
   - Renal consulted. Advised to continue Lasix PRN, as elevated Cr
   likely secondary to chronic renal disease vs. pre-renal. Will order Fe
   studies for possible EPO treatment, PTH as pt on home Calcitriol
   treatment, per renal recs.
   - Renal ultrasound with dopplers tomorrow a.m. to eval patency of flow
   to kidneys
   - foley in place
   - strict I/O
   - U/A negative, urine culture pending
   - As pt on Lasix, FeUrea calculated = >35%, suggesting less likely
   pre-renal.
   .
   # AG Metabolic Acidosis: Mild metabolic acidosis is likely in the
   setting of renal failure, but underlying etiology of this is unclear as
   discussed above.
   .
   # Mild Leukocytosis:  Unclear etiology.  No history of localizing
   symptoms. RLL infiltrate could be evolving pneumonia and also in acute
   on chronic renal failure which could be secondary to UTI. Low-grade
   fever to 100.7 this morning.
   - sputum cx if obtainable

   # HTN: Continue metoprolol, nifedipine, Hydralazine. Afterload
   reduction is very important to encourage forward flow. Unfortunately,
   need to avoid ACEI given renal failure.
   .
   # S/p CVA: continue aspirin

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presents with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF), and good diuresis with IV Lasix has been achieved. There is a possibility of evolving pneumonia given the right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and leukocytosis. Fluid balance will be challenging due to cardio-renal syndrome and underlying chronic kidney disease. A CT chest without contrast will be ordered to evaluate for possible underlying pulmonary pathology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience worsening respiratory distress due to CHF exacerbation or evolving pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary. Non-invasive ventilation support may be required.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels. Monitoring the response of creatinine to diuresis is important. Renal ultrasound with dopplers will be performed to evaluate the patency of flow to the kidneys.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: Mild metabolic acidosis is present, likely in the setting of renal failure. The underlying etiology is unclear and should be further investigated.
4. Infection: Leukocytosis and low-grade fever raise suspicion for an underlying infection, possibly pneumonia or urinary tract infection. Obtaining sputum culture and urine culture is necessary. Empirical antibiotic therapy has been started for presumed pneumonia.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient may develop fluid overload due to CHF and renal failure. Strict monitoring of fluid balance and daily weights is essential. Diuretics will continue to be administered as needed.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient may have electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hyponatremia, due to diuretic use and renal dysfunction. Regular electrolyte monitoring and correction as needed are required.
7. Pressure Ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest. Regular repositioning and preventive measures such as a bowel regimen and pressure-relieving devices should be implemented.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of respiratory distress, renal failure, infection, fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and pressure ulcers."

   Would favor non contrast Chest CT to assess for interstitial disease or
   infiltrates that are more than simple pulm edema.

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been started on diuretics due to pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic heart failure and progressive acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 141/52 to 129/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, diminished breath sounds with scattered rales but no wheezes, and trace pedal edema. The patient is attentive and responds to questions.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 180 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 4.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 158 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.03 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
1) Respiratory distress: Pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic heart failure and progressive acute renal failure. The patient will be changed to a ventilator mask, titrating oxygen down to maintain saturation above 93%. A non-contrast chest CT will be performed to assess for interstitial disease or infiltr"

   Assessment and Plan Hypoxemic Resp Distress
   1) Respiratory distress:  pulmonary edema in setting of diastolic heart
   failure and progressive ARF. Seems a bit  better with more aggressive
   diurese but less than we would have hoped. Would change to Venti mask,
   titrate O2 down to sats > 93 % and see if we have made any progress.
   Would favor non contrast Chest CT to assess for interstitial disease or
   infiltrates that are more than simple pulm edema.
   2) Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: time for consultation by nephrology
   given progression of her ARF.
   3) HTN: nifedipine and Toprol and Hydralazine
   3) Anemia: stable
   4) prophylaxis
   -SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis

","Summary:
The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic heart failure and progressive acute renal failure. The patient's condition has improved slightly with aggressive diuresis but not as much as expected. The plan is to switch to non-invasive ventilation, titrate oxygen down to maintain SpO2 > 93%, and assess for progress. A non-contrast chest CT will be done to evaluate for interstitial disease or infiltrates beyond simple pulmonary edema. Nephrology consultation is requested due to the worsening of acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's hypertension will be managed with nifedipine, Toprol, and hydralazine. The patient's anemia is stable. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) will be provided using subcutaneous heparin. The patient's code status is full code, and they will receive ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if non-invasive ventilation is ineffective or if there are underlying conditions causing significant lung dysfunction.
2. Progression of acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may continue to deteriorate, leading to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infection.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's diastolic heart failure may lead to further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation"

   Multifocal airspace consolidation with air bronchograms, most severe in
   the
   upper lobes, right more severe than left. There is a moderate right
   pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion with associated
   atelectasis of the adjacent lung. These findings likely reflect
   multi-focal pneumonia with fluid overload. Heart is enlarged with a
   small pericardial effusion and coronary artery calcifications. Several
   enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are present with paratracheal nodes
   and AP window nodes measuring approx. 1.5cm in short axis. These nodes
   may be reactive in nature. Visualized upper

   Multifocal airspace consolidation with air bronchograms, most severe in
   the
   upper lobes, right more severe than left. There is a moderate right
   pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion with associated
   atelectasis of the adjacent lung. These findings likely reflect
   multi-focal pneumonia with fluid overload. Heart is enlarged with a
   small pericardial effusion and coronary artery calcifications. Several
   enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are present with paratracheal nodes
   and AP window nodes measuring approx. 1.5cm in short axis. These nodes
   may be reactive in nature. Visualized upper
   abdomen reveals a right renal artery stent and tiny gallstone.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 70 year-old female with a history of diastolic
   heart failure, CKD who presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia
   and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory distress:  Likely secondary to CHF.  Good diuresis with
   IV lasix.  Most likely precipitant is cessation of diuretics, and
   unclear if renal failure preceded this or is a result. Other
   possibility is evolving pneumonia given RLL infiltrate on CXR and
   leukocytosis.  Fluid balance will be challenging due to cardio-renal
   syndrome, underlying chronic kidney disease.  Question underlying
   pulmonary process besides pulmonary overload [**12-29**] CHF.
   - Will check CT chest without contrast to  eval for possible underlying
   pulmonary pathology
   - CE negative x 2
   - Will try to advance diet today if pt
s O2 sats tolerate being off
   face mask
   - Continue Lasix IV PRN hypoxia/ dypsnea. Will try to limit if
   possible, as pt already 2L negative today.
   - Titrate O2 down as tolerated.
   - NIPPV as long as tolerating.
   - continue statin, beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], nifedipine, afterload reduction
   - Obtain sputum culture
   - Will start Vancomycin IV  (Day 1) and Levaquin (Day 1)empirically for
   presumed PNA
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely pre-renal [**12-29**] poor forward flow, baseline
   creatinine in the low 3's, currently 5.2. that being said, unable to
   know clearly whether renal function worsened as primary precipitant for
   heart failure secondary to volume overload. Cr has not improved despite
   adequate diuresis, suggesting an underlying renal dysfunction.Monitor
   response of creatinine to diuresis.
   - Renal consulted. Advised to continue Lasix PRN, as elevated Cr
   likely secondary to chronic renal disease vs. pre-renal. Will order Fe
   studies for possible EPO treatment, PTH as pt on home Calcitriol
   treatment, per renal recs.
   - Renal ultrasound with dopplers tomorrow a.m. to eval patency of flow
   to kidneys
   - foley in place
   - strict I/O
   - U/A negative, urine culture pending
   - As pt on Lasix, FeUrea calculated = >35%, suggesting less likely
   pre-renal.
   .
   # AG Metabolic Acidosis: Mild metabolic acidosis is likely in the
   setting of renal failure, but underlying etiology of this is unclear as
   discussed above.
   .
   # Mild Leukocytosis:  Unclear etiology.  No history of localizing
   symptoms. RLL infiltrate could be evolving pneumonia and also in acute
   on chronic renal failure which could be secondary to UTI. Low-grade
   fever to 100.7 this morning.
   - sputum cx if obtainable
   - UA negative, urine cx pending
   - monitor wbc and fever curve
   - Will start Vancomycin IV  (Day 1) and Levaquin (Day 1)empirically for
   presumed PNA
   .
   # DM2: insulin sliding scale while NPO. Once eating can resume standing
   Humalin dosing as she takes at home.
   - Continue gabapentin for pain
   .
   # HTN: Continue metoprolol, nifedipine, Hydralazine. Afterload
   reduction is very important to encourage forward flow. Unfortunately,
   need to avoid ACEI given renal failure.
   .
   # S/p CVA: continue aspirin
   .
   # FEN: Negative ~>2L today with lasix. Monitor strict UOP. Replete
   lytes prn. Will try cardiac/diabetic diet today if pt
s O2 sat
   tolerates being off face mask.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia, and was found to have acute on chronic renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). Good diuresis with IV lasix has been administered. The precipitant could be the cessation of diuretics, and it is unclear if renal failure preceded this or is a result. Another possibility is evolving pneumonia given the right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and leukocytosis. Fluid balance will be challenging due to cardio-renal syndrome, underlying chronic kidney disease, and any underlying pulmonary pathology.

2. Renal Failure: The patient likely has pre-renal renal failure, but the elevated creatinine suggests an underlying renal dysfunction. Monitoring the response of creatinine to diuresis is important. Renal ultrasound with dopplers will be done tomorrow morning to evaluate the patency of flow to the kidneys.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: Mild metabolic acidosis is likely in the setting of renal failure, but the underlying etiology is unclear. This could be related to the patient's acute on chronic renal failure.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has mild leukocytosis, which could be due to evolving pneumonia"

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, and diastolic dysfunction. She was admitted with hypoxemia and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has been experiencing minimal improvement despite diuresis and has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia with some volume overload on chest CT. Antibiotic coverage for nosocomial pathogens was initiated yesterday. The patient is also showing signs of renal failure, with a rising creatinine level indicating the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the near future.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygenation of tissues. This can be due to the multifocal pneumonia and may worsen if not properly managed with appropriate antibiotic therapy and weaning off oxygen as tolerated.
2. Renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest progressive renal impairment. If not addressed promptly, this can lead to further deterioration in renal function and the need for RRT.
3. Anemia: The patient shows evidence of iron deficiency anemia. If left untreated, it can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased quality of life.
4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure"

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, and diastolic dysfunction. She was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute on chronic renal failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 123/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula with 50% FiO2. 

The patient has been started on vancomycin and levofloxacin for multifocal pneumonia with some volume overload. Her renal function has continued to worsen, and she will likely need renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the near future. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypoxemia, progression of renal failure requiring RRT, anemia due to chronic kidney disease, and management of diabetes and hypertension. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing antibiotic coverage for nosocomial pneumonia, close monitoring of oxygenation and weaning off oxygen as tolerated, initiation of renal diet, and scheduling a renal ultrasound with dopplers on Monday. She will also be evaluated for iron deficiency anemia and receive dietary supplements accordingly."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension (HTN), and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in left hemiparesis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 132/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normal pupils, symmetrical chest expansion, clear lung sounds, warm skin, and normal muscle tone. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, purposeful movement, and exhibits an intention tremor.

Laboratory results show elevated serum creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 245 mL over the past 24 hours.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory distress - unclear etiology, possibly due to CHF (diastolic dysfunction). Continue treatment of CHF and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of renal failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress and pulmonary infiltrates. 

The patient's respiratory distress may be attributed to congestive heart failure (CHF) with possible diastolic dysfunction. However, pneumonia or an immune/idiopathic-mediated process are less likely causes. 

The pulmonary infiltrates could be due to pulmonary edema, which has shown some improvement in clinical symptoms. This improvement might be related to increased diuresis, although it cannot be completely ruled out that antimicrobials have contributed to the improvement. 

The patient also has acute renal failure and chronic renal insufficiency. The acute renal failure requires careful management in the ICU setting. The patient's hypertension needs to be controlled, and there is a concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. 

The patient has a history of stroke, resulting in left hemiparesis. This should be taken into consideration when planning the patient's care and treatment. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires close monitoring and management of nutrition, glycemic control, and fluid balance. The patient has multiple lines in place, including an 18-gauge line inserted on 07/05/2171 at 08:58 AM. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and cerebrovascular accident. She presented with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient has been stable on oxygen via nasal cannula and has tolerated oral intake. Her allergies include no known drug allergies. She was given Vancomycin as the last dose of antibiotics.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 85 bpm (58-87), blood pressure ranging from 132/39-62 to 100/37-59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (14-29), and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 720 mL, with 250 mL given intravenously. Output includes 965 mL of urine and 380 mL of blood products. The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device of a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of ///18/.

Physical examination findings include general appearance with no acute distress, crackles in the bilateral lung bases, soft and non-tender abdomen, left-sided hand tremor, and unassessed skin and neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 6.2 to 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 28.3-30.4 g/dL, platelet count of 180-200 K/uL, creatinine level of 4.7-5.5 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.03, and glucose level of 132-203 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated TCO2, decreased Hct, and various electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being treated for respiratory distress, likely due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation with possible pneumonia. She is stable on oxygen via nasal cannula, and tests for Legionella antigen and chest X-ray have been done. The plan includes an echocardiogram to re-evaluate cardiac status, repeat CXR, continued diuresis with lasix, continuation of Vancomycin and Levaquin empirically for presumed pneumonia, and other respiratory interventions.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with the etiology not clear. Renal consultation has been obtained, and the patient is receiving IV iron and Epo. A renal ultrasound with dopplers has been recommended, along with strict intake/output monitoring.

Other issues include mild leukocytosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, history of cerebrovascular accident, and nutritional management.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's history and current condition, potential medical complications may include worsening congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, infection (such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection), and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and oliguria. Upon admission, the patient was found to have a low oxygen saturation level of 79% on nasal cannula, which was addressed by starting supplemental oxygen therapy and nebulizer treatment. Oxygen saturation levels were successfully restored to 92-95%. The patient also received 80 IV Lasix for low urine output. 

Yesterday, the patient underwent renal ultrasound and echocardiogram. The echocardiogram showed diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction greater than 75%. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin at 10:30 AM and levofloxacin at 10:05 PM. 

Infusions include furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented. 

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and laboratory results. 

Potential Medical Complications:

   # Respiratory distress: Patient was doing much better but did desat
   last night and responded to nebulizer treatment and increasing oxygen.
   02 sats appear to be position dependent as she desats mostly when
   laying down.  Ocerall she is much improved from admission indicating a
   CHF exacerbation and not pneumonia given quick resolution, though
   improvement secondary to antibiotics cannot be excluded.  ECHO
   yesterday showed EF >75% and diastolic dysfunction, so new Left sided
   heart failure is not contributing.   Legionella antigen negative, CE

   for presumed PNA. Vanc dose not given y
day for high trough, awaiting
   vanc level today for dosing
   - continue neb treatments

   - Titrate O2 down as tolerated.
   - continue statin, beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], nifedipine, afterload reduction
   - D/C sputum culture as it will not be useful after 4 days of
   antibiotics and patient unable to cough up sputum.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: etiology not clear. Baseline

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. She presents with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient was previously doing better but experienced respiratory distress last night and required nebulizer treatment and increased oxygen. Her 02 sats improved to 92-95%. The patient also had low urine output, for which she was given 80 IV lasix. An echocardiogram showed diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) >75%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated empirically for presumed pneumonia with antibiotics, but improvement cannot be excluded.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, and there is no information about her current blood sugar levels or diabetic management.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility in the ICU. Prophylaxis with heparin SC is mentioned.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness. Prophylaxis is mentioned.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 70 year-old female with a history of diastolic
   heart failure, CKD who presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia
   and acute on chronic renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory distress: Patient was doing much better but did desat
   last night and responded to nebulizer treatment.  Perhaps a component
   of COPD? Much improved from admission indicating a CHF exacerbation and
   not pneumonia given quick resolution, though improvement secondary to
   antibiotics cannot be excluded.  ECHO yesterday showed EF >75% and
   diastolic dysfunction, so new Left sided heart failure is not
   contributing.   Legionella antigen negative, CE negative
   - repeat CXR
   - Continue diuresis with lasix, goal is  negative 1L today
   - Continue Vancomycin IV  (Day 4) and Levaquin (Day 4) empirically for
   presumed PNA. Vanc dose not given y
day for high trough, awaiting vanc
   level today for dosing
   - continue neb treatments
   - chest PT, incensive spirometry, OOB to chair
   - speech and swallow eval
   - Titrate O2 down as tolerated.
   - continue statin, beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], nifedipine, afterload reduction
   - Obtain sputum culture if possible (pt has very little cough
   currently)
   - gconsider PFTs
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: etiology not clear. Baseline
   creatinine 3's, currently 5.3 and trending down.
   - Renal consulted. Recommended started IV iron and Epo yesterday.
   - Renal ultrasound yesterday-awaiting results
   - strict I/O
   - U/A negative, urine culture pending
   # Mild Leukocytosis:  resolved
   # DM2: RISS for now, patient just started tolerating po and we will
   resume home regimen once pt start eating reliably.
   - Continue gabapentin for pain
   # HTN: Has been stable. Continue metoprolol, nifedipine, Hydralazine.
   Afterload reduction is very important to encourage forward flow.
   -avoid ACEI given renal failure.
   # S/p CVA: stable exam, continue aspirin
   # FEN: Renal/diabetic diet.
   # Access: PIV's
   # PPx: heparin SC, bowel regimen, no PPI
   # Code: Full
   # Dispo: Floor if patient remains stable on 02 via NC

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. She presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia, as well as acute on chronic renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced desaturation last night but responded to nebulizer treatment. This may indicate a component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the improvement after nebulizer treatment suggests a possible exacerbation of congestive heart failure rather than pneumonia. 
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The etiology of this condition is not clear, but the patient's baseline creatinine levels were in the 3's and are currently trending down. The patient is receiving IV iron and Epo, and a renal ultrasound was performed yesterday with results pending. Strict input/output measurements are being maintained.
3. Mild leukocytosis: The patient had slightly elevated white blood cell counts but this has since resolved.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient is on an insulin sliding scale regimen, which will be resumed once the patient starts eating reliably.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and medications such as metoprolol, nifedipine, and Hydralazine are being continued. Afterload reduction is important to encourage forward flow, but ACE inhibitors are avoided due to renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has a history of chronic problem hearing voices of friends and family members, which is non-threatening. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 122/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination findings are largely unremarkable, except for left hemiparesis, which is chronic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may be attributed to pulmonary edema. This condition is improving radiographically and clinically. It is important to continue current management, including optimizing blood pressure control.
2. Diastolic Dysfunction: Diastolic dysfunction is likely the etiology of the patient's pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening renal failure. Optimizing blood pressure control is crucial.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient is tolerating a net negative fluid balance. It is essential to continue net diuresis to prevent fluid overload.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure. The creatinine level is improving towards baseline. Continued monitoring and management of renal function are necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS --   attributed to pulmonary edema.  Improved.
   CHF -- diastolic dysfunction.  Improving radiographically and
   clinically
   DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION -- likely etiology of pulmonary edema in setting
   of worsening renal failure.
   FLUIDs -- tolerating net negative balance.  Continue to net diurese.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- encourage PO
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic.  Improving towards baseline.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient experienced an episode of oxygen desaturation last night, which responded to increased supplemental oxygen and nebulizer therapy. The patient's symptoms have improved this morning.

Medical History:
The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (diastolic dysfunction). There are no known drug allergies.

Infusions:
The patient is receiving furosemide (Lasix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

Other Medications:
The patient was previously receiving vancomycin and levofloxacin.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory symptoms.

Physical Examination:
The patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 122/51 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has normal heart sounds, clear lung sounds, and no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination is also unremarkable.

Lab Results:
The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure, CKD who
   presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia and acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory distress: Patient was doing much better but did desat
   last night and responded to nebulizer treatment and increasing oxygen.
    02 sats appear to be position dependent as she desats mostly when
   laying down.  Ocerall she is much improved from admission indicating a
   CHF exacerbation and not pneumonia given quick resolution, though
   improvement secondary to antibiotics cannot be excluded.  ECHO
   yesterday showed EF >75% and diastolic dysfunction, so new Left sided
   heart failure is not contributing.   Legionella antigen negative, CE
   negative
   - repeat CXR
   - Continue diuresis with lasix, goal is  negative 1L today
   - Continue Vancomycin IV  (Day [**3-4**]) and Levaquin (Day [**3-4**]) empirically
   for presumed PNA. Vanc dose not given y
day for high trough, awaiting
   vanc level today for dosing
   - continue neb treatments
   - chest PT, incensive spirometry, OOB to chair
   - speech and swallow eval
   - Titrate O2 down as tolerated.
   - continue statin, beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], nifedipine, afterload reduction
   - D/C sputum culture as it will not be useful after 4 days of
   antibiotics and patient unable to cough up sputum.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: etiology not clear. Baseline
   creatinine 3's, currently 5.3 and trending down.
   - Renal consulted. Recommended started IV iron and Epo yesterday.
   - Renal ultrasound yesterday: Will call radiology to ask about interval
   change of renal ultrasound.
   - strict I/O
   - U/A negative, urine culture pending
   # Mild Leukocytosis:  resolved
   # DM2: RISS for now, patient just started tolerating po and we will
   resume home regimen once pt start eating reliably.
   - Continue gabapentin for pain
   # HTN: Has been stable. Continue metoprolol, nifedipine, Hydralazine.
   Afterload reduction is very important to encourage forward flow.  We
   should keep in mind that her SBP may have been running high chronically
   before she comes in(160s), but for now 120s-130s is ok.
   -avoid ACEI given renal failure.
   # S/p CVA: stable exam, continue aspirin
   #Auditory/Visual Hallucinations: Patient reported hearding voices and
   believing in Ghosts.  She reports this has always been true and has
   mentioned it to the nurse before.  These hallucinations can be
   occasionally frightening, but she is not worried about them.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. She presents with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient's condition has been improving since admission, indicating a possible exacerbation of congestive heart failure rather than pneumonia. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction greater than 75% and diastolic dysfunction, ruling out new left-sided heart failure as a contributing factor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced desaturation last night but responded well to nebulizer treatment and increased oxygen. Positional dependence of oxygen saturation suggests the possibility of fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can lead to further respiratory distress.
2. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were in the 3's, and currently, it is 5.3 and trending down. Renal ultrasound did not show any interval change. This indicates ongoing kidney dysfunction, and careful monitoring of fluid balance and renal function is essential to prevent further complications.
3. Pneumonia: Although the patient's symptoms improved after starting antibiotics, the possibility of pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. Continued monitoring for fever, worsening respiratory symptoms, or new infiltrates on chest X-ray is necessary.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient's condition has improved overall, with only one transient desaturation event that resolved on its own. The patient is maintaining adequate oxygen saturation with the use of a nasal cannula.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the respiratory symptoms mentioned above.

Vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/64 to 171/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of overweight or obesity. The patient's eyes, conjunctiva, and head/ears/nose/throat are normal. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse and S1 and S2 heart sounds. Peripheral pulses are present and symmetric in both upper and lower extremities. The respiratory/chest examination is clear with no wheezes or crackles. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination is attentive with purposeful movements.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood chemistries indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creat"

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient's condition has improved overall, with a single transient desaturation episode that resolved spontaneously. The patient is maintaining adequate SaO2 with a nasal cannula alone.

The patient has a history of chronic right foot pain, which is described as minimal. They have been receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and hydralazine. The patient also has a past medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus.

Physical examination findings reveal that the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Their eyes are normal, and they do not have any signs of conjunctival edema, jaundice, or scleral icterus. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart rhythm, and there are no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds detected. The patient's extremities are warm and well-perfused, with no cyanosis or clubbing observed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, suggesting renal dysfunction. Other lab values such as white blood cell count, platelet count, and electrolytes are within normal limits. Troponin T levels are below the detection limit, indicating no evidence of acute coronary syndrome.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 70 year-old female with a history of diastolic
   heart failure, CKD who presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia
   and acute on chronic renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory distress: Patient was doing much with minimal desats last
   night.  Overall she is much improved from admission indicating a CHF
   exacerbation and not pneumonia given quick resolution, though
   improvement secondary to antibiotics cannot be excluded.  CXR this AM
   is supine and likely represents layering effusion rather than worsening
   pulm edema. ECHO yesterday showed EF >75% and diastolic dysfunction, so
   new Left sided heart failure is not contributing.   Legionella antigen
   negative, CE negative
   - Continue diuresis with lasix, goal is  negative 0.5-1L today
   - Continue Vancomycin IV  (Day [**3-4**]) and Levaquin (Day [**3-4**]) empirically
   for presumed PNA. Vanc level in AM
 redoes if appropriate
   - continue neb treatments
   - chest PT, incensive spirometry, OOB to chair
   - Titrate O2 down as tolerated.
   - continue statin, beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], nifedipine (change to PO),
   afterload reduction
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: etiology not clear. Baseline
   creatinine 3's, currently 5.6 and stable.
   - Renal consulted. Recommended started IV iron and Epo yesterday.
   - Renal ultrasound without interval change.
   - strict I/O
   - U/A negative, urine culture pending
   # Mild Leukocytosis:  resolved
   # DM2: RISS for now, patient just started tolerating po and we will
   resume home regimen once pt start eating reliably.
   - Continue gabapentin for pain
   # HTN: Has been stable. Continue metoprolol, nifedipine, Hydralazine.
   Afterload reduction is very important to encourage forward flow.  We
   should keep in mind that her SBP may have been running high chronically
   before she comes in(160s), but for now 120s-130s is ok.
   -avoid ACEI given renal failure.
   # S/p CVA: stable exam, continue aspirin
   #Auditory/Visual Hallucinations: Patient reported hearding voices and
   believing in Ghosts.  She reports this has always been true and has
   mentioned it to the nurse before.  These hallucinations can be
   occasionally frightening, but she is not worried about them.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease who presented with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and acute on chronic renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory distress, which is believed to be due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation rather than pneumonia. The patient is being treated with diuretics, antibiotics, and other medications for her conditions. Her renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL. She also has mild leukocytosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, a history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and auditory/visual hallucinations. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/42 to 171/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within the normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in both lungs at the bases, trace edema in both lower extremities, and soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, and troponin-T levels, as well as decreased potassium and sodium levels. The patient's plan includes continuing diuretics, antibiotics, and other treatments for her various conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include"

   night.  Overall she is much improved from admission indicating a CHF
   exacerbation and not pneumonia given quick resolution, though
   improvement secondary to antibiotics cannot be excluded.  CXR this AM
   is supine and likely represents layering effusion rather than worsening
   pulm edema ECHO yesterday showed EF >75% and diastolic dysfunction, so
   new Left sided heart failure is not contributing.   Legionella antigen
   negative, CE negative
   - repeat CXR
   - Continue diuresis with lasix, goal is  negative 1L today
   - Continue Vancomycin IV  (Day [**3-4**]) and Levaquin (Day [**3-4**]) empirically
   for presumed PNA. Vanc dose not given y
day for high trough, awaiting
   vanc level today for dosing
   - continue neb treatments
   - chest PT, incensive spirometry, OOB to chair
   - speech and swallow eval
   - Titrate O2 down as tolerated.
   - continue statin, beta [**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], nifedipine, afterload reduction
   - D/C sputum culture as it will not be useful after 4 days of
   antibiotics and patient unable to cough up sputum.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: etiology not clear. Baseline
   creatinine 3's, currently 5.3 and trending down.
   - Renal consulted. Recommended started IV iron and Epo yesterday.
   - Renal ultrasound yesterday: Will call radiology to ask about interval
   change of renal ultrasound.
   - strict I/O
   - U/A negative, urine culture pending
   # Mild Leukocytosis:  resolved
   # DM2: RISS for now, patient just started tolerating po and we will
   resume home regimen once pt start eating reliably.
   - Continue gabapentin for pain
   # HTN: Has been stable. Continue metoprolol, nifedipine, Hydralazine.
   Afterload reduction is very important to encourage forward flow.  We
   should keep in mind that her SBP may have been running high chronically
   before she comes in(160s), but for now 120s-130s is ok.
   -avoid ACEI given renal failure.
   # S/p CVA: stable exam, continue aspirin
   #Auditory/Visual Hallucinations: Patient reported hearding voices and
   believing in Ghosts.  She reports this has always been true and has
   mentioned it to the nurse before.  These hallucinations can be
   occasionally frightening, but she is not worried about them.
   -Psych C/S
   # FEN: Renal/diabetic diet.
   # Access: PIV's
   # PPx: heparin SC, bowel regimen, no PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), presenting with shortness of breath and hypoxia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient was admitted due to respiratory distress and hypoxia, indicating a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 134/42 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 6L NC. The patient is diuresing well with approximately 1L of lasix. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, indicating renal impairment, as well as elevated glucose levels. The echocardiogram yesterday showed an ejection fraction >75% and diastolic dysfunction, suggesting that new left-sided heart failure is not contributing to her symptoms. 

The plan includes repeating a chest X-ray, continuing diuresis with lasix, and administering antibiotics for presumed pneumonia. The patient will continue neb treatments, be titrated off oxygen as tolerated, undergo chest PT, spirometry, and OOB to a chair. 

The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, with a baseline creatinine of 3's, currently at 5.3, and trending down. Renal consultation recommended starting IV iron and E"
