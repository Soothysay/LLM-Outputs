   acute renal failure, syncope, bradycardia, acidosis, altered mental
   status
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   CT of head/chest/abdomen/pelvis at outside hospital raised question of
   small bowel obstruction, mediastinal fluid collection, small left
   pleural effusion. Initial WBC 16K, hct 25, creat 7.3, bicarb 7. Patient
   was unresponsive.
   In ED, exam not suggestive of SBO. Patient has ileostomy due to
   colectomy for ulcerative colitis. She received additional fluids,
   pressors were decreased, and transferred to MICU.
   In MICU, patient was given additional fluids, weaned off pressors,
   given bicarb to get serum bicarb to 15. She has remained oliguric,
   however. Patient treated with external warming. CXR showed question of
   LLL infiltrate. RUQ ultrasound negative for biliary obstruction. UA
   notable for pyuria. Lactate has been 6.7.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim pending.

   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   ACIDOSIS
   With hypothermia and evidence of both urine and lung infections,
   suspect infection is playing a signficant role in her hemodynamic
   condition. WBC elevated on presentation; down somewhat this morning.
   Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics. Not clear if the pulmonary
   process was a primary or secondary event. The RLL infiltrate is
   consistent with aspiration. Elevated lipase also raised issue of
   possible pancreatitis; RUQ ultrasound negative for ductal dilatation.
   Blood pressure has improved with fluids.
   While examining patient, I placed her on PSV 5/5. She sustained VT of
   500 and respiratory rate of 18-20, with minute ventilation of 10. The
   minute ventilation is likely up as a compensation for her metabolic
   acidosis since the PaCO2 is down appropriately for the increase in
   ventilation; this argues against a significant increase in dead space.
   Patient has a mixed [**Last Name 4344**] problem with both an anion gap and
   non-gap acidosis. Gap probably due to acute renal failure, now that
   lactate has improved. Nongap acidosis probably related to bicarb losses
   from GI tract.
   Patient remains unresponsive with negative head CT scan. Suspect
   toxic/metabolic enchephalopathy; may have taken excess of her baseline
   medications (TCA) although we are not seeing significant cardiac
   sequelae.
   Hct down; stool guaic positive. Not at transfusion threshold now.
   Platelets also down; being monitored.
   Acute renal failure may be due to ATN. Electrolytes acceptable; getting
   potassium repletion. Need to be careful with Lactated Ringers because
   of its potssium content.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include hypotension, hypothermia, chronic renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, syncope, bradycardia, acidosis, and altered mental status. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests and interventions, including a CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis; fluid resuscitation; antibiotic therapy; and mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating poor perfusion.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to inadequate respiratory function.
3. Pneumonia: Chest X-ray findings suggest a possible right lower lobe infiltrate, which may indicate pneumonia.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output) suggest acute kidney injury.
5. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's history of chronic renal insufficiency may contribute to the current acute renal failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates a decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a possible bleeding risk.
8. Altered Mental Status: The patient is unresponsive and has a negative head CT scan, suggesting a possible toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
9. Acidosis: The patient has both an"

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, OTHER
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   ###Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and
   bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology. Off pressors but
   sub-optimal urine output. Concern for severe infection, but now lactate
   = 1 and WBC
s trending down slowly..  In terms of infecious etiologies
   the most likely source would be the urine given grossly positive
   urinalysis, but urine culture is negative in context of positive UA. No
   evidence to suggest blood loss as an etiology at this time, blood coffe
   ground emesis only just noted.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics with (vancomycin) and cefepime,
   Ceftriaxone.
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - Left sided effusion versus mass on CXR noted.  Unfortunately cannot
   find CD from outside hospital. Will need to obtain or repeat.
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend leukocytosis, lactate
   ###Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunately
   urine output not especially responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis
   grossly positive for infection, but culture negative. With FeNa = 1%
   (borderline), so difficult to distinguish between pre-renal and
   intrinsic. However, given minimal improvement with fluid boluses,
   together with Urine Na under 25 and urine Cl under 25, there is likely
   less of a pre-renal component and we must increasingly suspecting
   intrinsic failures. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan
   to suggest post-renal obstruction.
   -acidemia improving 7.33-7.88 with bicarb, so no indication for HD at
   this time
   -recheck ABG this PM and give [**1-30**] AMPS bicarb if needed.
   ###Non-anion gap acidosis: Today, pH = 7.38 from 7.33, so acidosis
   improving. Anion Gap = 11 when not corrected for albumin (this
   correction does not appear to me to usually be done in these analysis
   for reasons that are not clear to me) , so by this measure alone, this
   is a non-anion gap acidosis.  (If corrected, lower limit nl appears ?
   8.5). The Delta delta, however,  (change in bicarb = 22 while change in
   anion gap much less), suggests that  a concomitant non-anion gap
   acidosis exists.  So, let
s consider the differential for both
   Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1, which makes the
   differential RTA type I (but we lack a urine pH, so cannot confirm with
   range 5.5-6), vs. RTA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making this less
   likely). In short, with regards to the Anion gap differential, GI
   losses as etiology appear lower on the differential, and an intrinsic
   etiology, as also suggested above by urine lytes discussed under the
renal
 section, appears likely.
   2) Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: If the delta HCO[3] ^- is greater than the
   delta anion gap, then a concomitant non-anion gap acidosis must exist
   as outlined above. The relevant differential includes Diarrhea (no
   significant in history), RTA,  andpancreaticoduodenal fistula.
   So, let
s synthesize the above, and then try to incorporate the new 24
   hour event. The patient has both a gap and non-anion gap acidosis.
   Common causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is excluded
   by K, but RTA type I requires urine PH. So we need a urine PH to r/I or
   r/o this diagnosis, which would account for the anion gap component.
   Given the GI bleed and pancreatic enzyme elevation, the non-anion gap
   etiology is now more interesting. Both could be causing the non-anion
   gap component of the acidosis, with the RTA contributing as well.
   In short, the emerging DDx for Anion gap Acidosis is RTA. Emerging diff
   for Non-Anion gap acidosis is pancreaticoduodenal fistula in light of
   pancreatic enzyme elevation and upper GI bleed. Of note, from an
   anatomic perspective, a pancreaticoduodenal fistula is not far from the
   Ligament of Treitz, and so such a fistula, if inflamed and hemorrhagic,
   could account for the coffe ground emesis. In this regard, we have an
   emerging unifying diagnosis that nicely fits with the Acid-Base picture
   (we now have a multi-factorial (4 causes) etiology to her metabolic
   derangements.
   -To confirm, f/u CT Abdomen
   -obtain urine pH
   -trend pancreatic enzymes
   ###Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Unclear etiology, but perhaps
   pancreaticoduodenal fistula if present? Patient does not have clear
   risk factors as is s/p cholecystectomy and no known history of
   alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - aggressive hydration
   - followup read of CT scan with our radiologists
    - NGT to suction for now
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lactate
   ###Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to severe infection and
   acute renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities.  Now moving
   slightly to voice and withdrawing to pain.  Non contrast head CT was
   negative for bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   - serum toxicology positive only for tricyclics, will obtain urine tox
   if possible
   ###Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now in the setting
   of hypotension.
   ###Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   ###Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Seen on
   laboratories.
   - insulin sliding scale
   ###Anemia/Upper GI bleed:  Related to ?pancreaticoduodenal fistula?.
   Ostomy output is guaiac positive.  Unclear baseline.  Normocytic.
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   -ensure two large boar IV

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who presented with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. She was found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. She has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving IV fluids and medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains altered mentally status likely secondary to severe infection and acute renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with signs of shock, which may be due to sepsis or another underlying cause. It is crucial to monitor her blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output closely.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. This condition requires careful monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function.
3. Severe Acidosis: The patient has severe acidosis, which could be caused by lactic acidosis secondary to shock or other metabolic disturbances. Close monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG) and acid-base balance is necessary.
4. Elevated Pancreatic Enzymes: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes, which may indicate acute pancreatitis or a pancreaticoduodenal fistula. Further evaluation, including imaging studies and trend"

   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and
   bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology.  Concern for
   severe infection.  Cardiac shock seems less likely given lack of
   ischemic EKG changes and responsive to IVF rescuscitation.  Medication
   overdose also possible.  In terms of infecious etiologies the most
   likely source would be the urine given grossly positive urinalysis.
   Urine culture pending.  Per surgery, small bowel obstruction leading to
   intraabdominal catastrophe is less likely.  No evidence to suggest
   blood loss as an etiology at this time.
   - will add on cardiac enzymes to ensure no major event
   - broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - will send sputum cultures
   - concern for left sided effusion versus mass on CXR.  Unfortunately
   cannot find CD from outside hospital. Will need to obtain or repeat.
   - currently off pressors but continues to make very little urine
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend leukocytosis, lactate
   - appreciate surgical recommendations
   - continue to warm with bear hugger
   - will check cortisol stimulation
   Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunatley urine
   output not responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis grossly positive
   for infection.  No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan to suggest
   obstruction.
   - appreciate renal consult
   - will send urine electrolytes, esosinophils, urine osm
   - will need to spin urine
   - continue to bolus for urine output for now
   - may need dialysis for management of acidemia
   Non-anion gap acidosis: Concern for GI losses versus renal tubular
   acidosis. Given renal failure, suspect the later. Was present prior to
   receiving normal saline.
   - will check urine anion gap if able to obtain sample
   - bicarbonate up to 15 with replacement, will continue amps of
   bicarbonate as needed
   - will check osmolar gap as well
   Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Unclear etiology, may be secondary to
   poor perfusion.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be the cause of her original presentation.
   Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p cholecystectomy and
   no known history of alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - aggressive hydration
   - followup read of CT scan with our radiologists
   Concern for small bowel obstruction:  On outside hospital CT scan.
   Will need to review with our radiologists.  Clinically she is not
   distended and is having ostomy output.
   - NGT to suction for now
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lactate
   - appreciate surgical consult
   Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to severe infection and acute
   renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities.  Now moving slightly to

 SHOCK, OTHER
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and
   bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology.  Concern for
   severe infection.  Cardiac shock seems less likely given lack of
   ischemic EKG changes and responsive to IVF rescuscitation.  Medication
   overdose also possible.  In terms of infecious etiologies the most
   likely source would be the urine given grossly positive urinalysis.
   Urine culture pending.  Per surgery, small bowel obstruction leading to
   intraabdominal catastrophe is less likely.  No evidence to suggest
   blood loss as an etiology at this time.
   - will add on cardiac enzymes to ensure no major event
   - broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - will send sputum cultures
   - concern for left sided effusion versus mass on CXR.  Unfortunately
   cannot find CD from outside hospital. Will need to obtain or repeat.
   - currently off pressors but continues to make very little urine
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend leukocytosis, lactate
   - appreciate surgical recommendations
   - continue to warm with bear hugger
   - will check cortisol stimulation
   Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunatley urine
   output not responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis grossly positive
   for infection.  No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan to suggest
   obstruction.
   - appreciate renal consult
   - will send urine electrolytes, esosinophils, urine osm
   - will need to spin urine
   - continue to bolus for urine output for now
   - may need dialysis for management of acidemia
   Non-anion gap acidosis: Concern for GI losses versus renal tubular
   acidosis. Given renal failure, suspect the later. Was present prior to
   receiving normal saline.
   - will check urine anion gap if able to obtain sample
   - bicarbonate up to 15 with replacement, will continue amps of
   bicarbonate as needed
   - will check osmolar gap as well
   Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Unclear etiology, may be secondary to
   poor perfusion.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be the cause of her original presentation.
   Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p cholecystectomy and
   no known history of alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - aggressive hydration
   - followup read of CT scan with our radiologists
   Concern for small bowel obstruction:  On outside hospital CT scan.
   Will need to review with our radiologists.  Clinically she is not
   distended and is having ostomy output.
   - NGT to suction for now
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lactate
   - appreciate surgical consult
   Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to severe infection and acute
   renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities.  Now moving slightly to
   voice and withdrawing to pain.  Non contrast head CT was negative for
   bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   - serum toxicology positive only for tricyclics, will obtain urine tox
   if possible
   Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now in the setting of
   hypotension.
   Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Seen on
   laboratories.
   - insulin sliding scale
   Anemia:  Unclear etiology.  Ostomy output is guaiac positive.  Unclear
   baseline.  Normocytic.
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   FEN: LR for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes, bicarbonate
   as needed, NPO, NGT to suction
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, PPI
   Access: Right femoral line (will need to be changed), left a-line

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who presents from Hospital6 with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient has acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient was initially hypothermic, bradycardic, and hypotensive, which are concerning signs of shock. It is unclear what caused the shock, but possible etiologies include severe infection, medication overdose, or cardiac issues.

2. Infection: The patient has grossly positive urinalysis, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending to identify the specific pathogen causing the infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover a wide range of potential bacterial causes.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is very low, suggesting acute renal failure. This may be secondary to the shock or other factors. Urine electrolytes, eosinophils, and osmolarity need to be checked. If the patient does not respond to fluid resuscitation, dialysis may be necessary for managing acidemia.

4. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis, which could be due to gastrointestinal losses or renal tubular acidosis. Given the presence of acute renal failure, renal tubular acidosis"

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, OTHER
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   #Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and
   bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology. Off pressors but
   sub-optimal urine output. Concern for severe infection, but now lactate
   = 1 and WBC
s trending down slowly..  In terms of infecious etiologies
   the most likely source would be the urine given grossly positive
   urinalysis, but urine culture is negative in context of positive UA. No
   evidence to suggest blood loss as an etiology at this time, blood coffe
   ground emesis only just noted.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics with (vancomycin) and cefepime,
   Ceftriaxone.
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - Left sided effusion versus mass on CXR noted.  Unfortunately cannot
   find CD from outside hospital. Will need to obtain or repeat.
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend leukocytosis, lactate
   Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunately urine
   output not especially responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis grossly
   positive for infection, but culture negative. With FeNa = 1%
   (borderline), so difficult to distinguish between pre-renal and
   intrinsic. However, given minimal improvement with fluid boluses,
   together with Urine Na under 25 and urine Cl under 25, there is likely
   less of a pre-renal component and we must increasingly suspecting
   intrinsic failures. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan
   to suggest post-renal obstruction.
   -acidemia improving 7.33-7.88 with bicarb, so no indication for HD at
   this time
   -recheck ABG this PM and give [**1-30**] AMPS bicarb if needed.
   Non-anion gap acidosis: Today, pH = 7.38 from 7.33, so acidosis
   improving. Anion Gap = 11 if not corrected for albumin, so by the
   typical measure, this is a non-anion gap acidosis.  (If corrected,
   lower limit nl appears ? 8.5). Delta deltat = (change in bicarb = 22.
   Change in anion gap much less). Therefore, a concomitant non-anion gap
   acidosis exists.  So, let
s consider the differential for both
   Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1, which makes the
   differential RTA type I (but we lack a urine pH, so cannot confirm with
   range 5.5-6), vs. TRA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making this less
   likely). In short, increasingly GI losses as etiology appears lower on
   the differential, and an intrinsic etiology, as also suggested above,
   appears likely.
   -recheck ABG this PM and give [**1-30**] AMPS bicarb if needed
   2) Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: If the delta HCO[3] ^- is greater than the
   delta anion gap, then a concomitant non-anion gap acidosis must exist
   as outlined above. The differential isDiarrhea, RTA,
   pancreaticoduodenal fistula.
   So, in light of the new upper GI bleeding, the discussion suddenly
   becomes fascinating. The patient has both a gap and non-anion gap
   acidosis. Common causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is
   excluded by K, but RTA type I requires urine PH. So we need a urine PH
   to r/I or r/o this diagnosis, which would account for the anion gap
   component. The non-anion gap etiology is now more intresting given the
   GI bleed and the pancreatic enzyme elevation. Both could be causing
   this acidosis, with the RTA contributing as well.
   In short, emerging deff for Anion gap Acidosis is RTA. Emerging diff
   for Non-Anion gap acidosis is pancreaticoduodenal fistula in light of
   pancreatic enzyme elevation and upper GI bleed. A pancreaticoduodenal
   fistulat is not far from the ligament of treitz, so this could account
   for the coffe ground emesis. In this regard, we have an emerging
   unifying diagnosis.
   -To confirm, CT Abdomen
   Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Unclear etiology, may be secondary to
   poor perfusion.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be the cause of her original presentation.
   Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p cholecystectomy and
   no known history of alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - aggressive hydration
   - followup read of CT scan with our radiologists
   Concern for small bowel obstruction:  On outside hospital CT scan.
   Will need to review with our radiologists.  Clinically she is not
   distended and is having ostomy output.
   - NGT to suction for now
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lactate
   - appreciate surgical consult
   Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to severe infection and acute
   renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities.  Now moving slightly to
   voice and withdrawing to pain.  Non contrast head CT was negative for
   bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   - serum toxicology positive only for tricyclics, will obtain urine tox
   if possible
   Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now in the setting of
   hypotension.
   Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Seen on
   laboratories.
   - insulin sliding scale
   Anemia:  Unclear etiology.  Ostomy output is guaiac positive.  Unclear
   baseline.  Normocytic.
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   FEN: LR for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes, bicarbonate

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and
   bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology.  Concern for
   severe infection.  Cardiac shock seems less likely given lack of
   ischemic EKG changes and responsive to IVF rescuscitation.  Medication
   overdose also possible.  In terms of infecious etiologies the most
   likely source would be the urine given grossly positive urinalysis.
   Urine culture pending.  Per surgery, small bowel obstruction leading to
   intraabdominal catastrophe is less likely.  No evidence to suggest
   blood loss as an etiology at this time.
   - will add on cardiac enzymes to ensure no major event
   - broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - will send sputum cultures
   - concern for left sided effusion versus mass on CXR.  Unfortunately
   cannot find CD from outside hospital. Will need to obtain or repeat.
   - currently off pressors but continues to make very little urine
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend leukocytosis, lactate
   - appreciate surgical recommendations
   - continue to warm with bear hugger
   - will check cortisol stimulation
   Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunatley urine
   output not responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis grossly positive
   for infection.  No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan to suggest
   obstruction.
   - appreciate renal consult
   - will send urine electrolytes, esosinophils, urine osm
   - will need to spin urine
   - continue to bolus for urine output for now
   - may need dialysis for management of acidemia
   Non-anion gap acidosis: Concern for GI losses versus renal tubular
   acidosis. Given renal failure, suspect the later. Was present prior to
   receiving normal saline.
   - will check urine anion gap if able to obtain sample
   - bicarbonate up to 15 with replacement, will continue amps of
   bicarbonate as needed
   - will check osmolar gap as well
   Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Unclear etiology, may be secondary to
   poor perfusion.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be the cause of her original presentation.
   Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p cholecystectomy and
   no known history of alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - aggressive hydration
   - followup read of CT scan with our radiologists
   Concern for small bowel obstruction:  On outside hospital CT scan.
   Will need to review with our radiologists.  Clinically she is not
   distended and is having ostomy output.
   - NGT to suction for now
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lactate
   - appreciate surgical consult
   Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to severe infection and acute
   renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities.  Now moving slightly to
   voice and withdrawing to pain.  Non contrast head CT was negative for
   bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   - serum toxicology positive only for tricyclics, will obtain urine tox
   if possible
   Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now in the setting of
   hypotension.
   Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Seen on
   laboratories.
   - insulin sliding scale
   Anemia:  Unclear etiology.  Ostomy output is guaiac positive.  Unclear
   baseline.  Normocytic.
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   FEN: LR for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes, bicarbonate
   as needed, NPO, NGT to suction
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, PPI
   Access: Right femoral line (will need to be changed), left a-line

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who presented with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:

1. Shock: The patient's initial presentation suggests shock, which is characterized by low body temperature (hypothermia), slow heart rate (bradycardia), and low blood pressure (hypotension). The cause of the shock is unclear, but severe infection is a likely possibility.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by the low urine output and elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. This could be secondary to the shock or due to other factors such as medication overdose or underlying conditions.

3. Mixed Acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which means there is an excess of acid in the body but it is not caused by an accumulation of unmeasurable anions. This could be due to gastrointestinal losses or renal tubular acidosis, especially considering the presence of acute renal failure.

4. Elevated Pancreatic Enzymes: The patient has elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes, which may indicate damage or inflammation of the pancreas. This could be secondary to poor perfusion or another underlying cause.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing confusion and altered"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved overnight, and he was successfully extubated this morning. He is now on low-dose supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and has excellent O2 sats. The patient's hemodynamic status has been stable, and his creatinine levels have stabilized. However, NG aspirate shows coffee grounds and guaiac positive, indicating a potential upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed. The patient has a history of altered mental status, but it is improving as evidenced by his response to verbal cues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGI bleed: The presence of coffee grounds and guaiac positive NG aspirate suggests ongoing UGI bleeding. Monitoring of hemoglobin (Hct) levels is essential, and further evaluation may include an upper endoscopy.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and daily weights are necessary. If the condition worsens, dialysis may be required.
3. Mixed acidosis: The patient continues to have anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Acid-base disturbances can complicate the patient's recovery and need to be carefully managed.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at high risk for stress ulcers due to"

 SHOCK, OTHER
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   ###Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and
   bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology. Off pressors but
   sub-optimal urine output, now improving. Concern for severe infection,
   but now lactate = 1 and WBC
s =12
13.8.  In terms of infecious
   etiologies the most likely source would be the urine given grossly
   positive urinalysis, but urine culture is negative in context of
   positive UA. No evidence to suggest blood loss as an etiology at this
   time, blood coffe ground emesis minimal
   - cefepime.
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend WBC
s. D/C further lactates.
   ###Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunately
   urine output not especially responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis
   grossly positive for infection, but culture negative. With FeNa = 1%
   (borderline), so difficult to distinguish between pre-renal and
   intrinsic. However, given minimal improvement with fluid boluses,
   together with Urine urine Cl under 25, there is likely less of a
   pre-renal component and we must increasingly suspecting intrinsic
   failures. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan to suggest
   post-renal obstruction.
   -acidemia improving 7.33-7.88 now at 7.4 with no bicarb overnight, so
   no indication for HD at this time
   -recheck ABG this PM and give [**1-30**] AMPS bicarb if needed.
   ###Non-anion gap acidosis: Today, pH = 7.4, so acidosis improving.
   Anion Gap = 11 yesterday when not corrected for albumin (this
   correction does not appear to me to usually be done in these analysis
   for reasons that are not clear to me) , so by this measure alone, this
   is a non-anion gap acidosis.  (If corrected, lower limit nl appears ?
   8.5). The Delta delta, however,  (change in bicarb = 22 while change in
   anion gap much less), suggests that  a concomitant non-anion gap
   acidosis exists.  So, let
s consider the differential for both
   Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1 (yesterday), which
   makes the differential RTA type I (urine pH is 5, is usually, with
   range 5.5-6 in type I), vs. RTA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making
   this less likely). In short, with regards to the Anion gap
   differential, GI losses as etiology appear lower on the differential,
   and an intrinsic etiology, as also suggested above by urine lytes
   discussed under the
renal
 section, appears likely.
   2) Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: If the delta HCO[3] ^- is greater than the
   delta anion gap, then a concomitant non-anion gap acidosis must exist
   as outlined above. The relevant differential includes Diarrhea (no
   significant in history), RTA,  andpancreaticoduodenal fistula., but
   there is no evidence of pancreatic fistual on CT.
   So, the patient has both a gap and non-anion gap acidosis. Common
   causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is excluded by K,
   but RTA type I remains possibility, perhaps together with some earlier
   volume depletion.
   ###Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Pancreatitis on CT.  Enzymes trending
   down. Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p
   cholecystectomy and no known history of alcoholism.  Exam unremarkable.
   Resolving issue.
   - No further reason to trend enzymes.
    - NGT to suction for now
   - do not exceed moderate fluids given LE edema, resolving pancreatitis
   - trend lactate
   ###Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to infection and acute
   renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities..  Non contrast head CT
   was negative for bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   ###Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now in the setting
   of hypotension.
   ###Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   ###Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.
   - insulin sliding scale
   ###Anemia/Upper GI bleed:  One time event w/ only 300cc
s total. Ostomy
   output was guaiac positive, but virtually no drop in HCT.  Will
   monitor, but will not consult GI given limited event and setting of
   acute illness.
   -maintain active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   -ensure two large boar IV

   bicarbonate as needed, NPO, NGT to suction

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who was admitted from Hospital6 with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient presented with acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient showed signs of shock, but now the condition is improving with sub-optimal urine output. There is a concern for severe infection, possibly from the urine given the positive urinalysis. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is on cefepime. 
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely secondary to shock. Despite fluid boluses, urine output has not improved significantly, indicating intrinsic renal failure rather than pre-renal failure. 
3. Non-anion gap acidosis: The patient has non-anion gap acidosis, which could be due to gastrointestinal losses or intrinsic renal failure. 
4. Elevated pancreatic enzymes: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes, suggesting pancreatitis. However, there are no clear risk factors for pancreatitis. The condition is resolving, but the patient should continue to trend lactate and follow up with cultures.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection and acute renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities. A non-contrast head CT was negative for bleed. 
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is"

   Ceftriaxone.
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend leukocytosis, lactate
   ###Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunately
   urine output not especially responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis
   grossly positive for infection, but culture negative. With FeNa = 1%

   ###Non-anion gap acidosis: Today, pH = 7.4, so acidosis improving.
   Anion Gap = 11 yesterday when not corrected for albumin (this

   for reasons that are not clear to me) , so by this measure alone, this
   is a non-anion gap acidosis.  (If corrected, lower limit nl appears ?

   anion gap much less), suggests that  a concomitant non-anion gap
   acidosis exists.  So, let
s consider the differential for both
   Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1 (yesterday), which
   makes the differential RTA type I (urine pH is 5, is usually, with
   range 5.5-6 in type I), vs. RTA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making

   So, the patient has both a gap and non-anion gap acidosis. Common
   causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is excluded by K,
   but RTA type I reminas possibility. Given the GI bleed and pancreatic
   enzyme elevation, the non-anion gap etiology is now more interesting.
   Both could be causing the non-anion gap component of the acidosis, with
   the RTA contributing as well.
   ###Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Pancreatitis on CT.  Enzymes trending
   down. Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p
   cholecystectomy and no known history of alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - aggressive hydration
   - followup read of CT scan with our radiologists
    - NGT to suction for now
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lactate
   ###Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to severe infection and
   acute renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities..  Non contrast head
   CT was negative for bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   - serum toxicology positive only for tricyclics, will obtain urine tox
   if possible
   ###Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now in the setting
   of hypotension.
   ###Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   ###Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Seen on
   laboratories.
   - insulin sliding scale
   ###Anemia/Upper GI bleed:  Related to ?pancreaticoduodenal fistula?.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis, presented from Hospital6 with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension.
- She was found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes.
- The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was extubated on am rounds yesterday.
- She is currently extubated and off pressors.
- Her urine output has improved, and she is not hypotensive.
- The patient's NG tube output was 300 cc for the day and was stopped around am rounds.
- She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) and has negative urine and blood cultures.
- Her blood glucose levels are high, and she is on an insulin sliding scale.
- The patient has non-anion gap acidosis and anion gap acidosis, likely secondary to shock and acute renal failure.
- Her elevated pancreatic enzymes suggest pancreatitis, which is improving with aggressive hydration.
- She has altered mental status likely due to severe infection, acute renal failure, and electrolyte abnormalities.
- The patient's anemia may be related to an upper gastrointestinal bleed.
- She is being closely monitored in the ICU with various interventions and prophylactic measures in place.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, OTHER
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   ###Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and
   bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology. Off pressors but
   sub-optimal urine output. Concern for severe infection, but now lactate
   = 1 and WBC
s trending down slowly..  In terms of infecious etiologies
   the most likely source would be the urine given grossly positive
   urinalysis, but urine culture is negative in context of positive UA. No
   evidence to suggest blood loss as an etiology at this time, blood coffe
   ground emesis only just noted.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics with (vancomycin) and cefepime,
   Ceftriaxone.
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - Left sided effusion versus mass on CXR noted.  Unfortunately cannot
   find CD from outside hospital. Will need to obtain or repeat.
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend leukocytosis, lactate
   ###Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunately
   urine output not especially responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis
   grossly positive for infection, but culture negative. With FeNa = 1%
   (borderline), so difficult to distinguish between pre-renal and
   intrinsic. However, given minimal improvement with fluid boluses,
   together with Urine Na under 25 and urine Cl under 25, there is likely
   less of a pre-renal component and we must increasingly suspecting
   intrinsic failures. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan
   to suggest post-renal obstruction.
   -acidemia improving 7.33-7.88 with bicarb, so no indication for HD at
   this time
   -recheck ABG this PM and give [**1-30**] AMPS bicarb if needed.
   ###Non-anion gap acidosis: Today, pH = 7.38 from 7.33, so acidosis
   improving. Anion Gap = 11 when not corrected for albumin (this
   correction does not appear to me to usually be done in these analysis
   for reasons that are not clear to me) , so by this measure alone, this
   is a non-anion gap acidosis.  (If corrected, lower limit nl appears ?
   8.5). The Delta delta, however,  (change in bicarb = 22 while change in
   anion gap much less), suggests that  a concomitant non-anion gap
   acidosis exists.  So, let
s consider the differential for both
   Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1, which makes the
   differential RTA type I (but we lack a urine pH, so cannot confirm with
   range 5.5-6), vs. RTA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making this less
   likely). In short, with regards to the Anion gap differential, GI
   losses as etiology appear lower on the differential, and an intrinsic
   etiology, as also suggested above by urine lytes discussed under the
renal
 section, appears likely.
   2) Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: If the delta HCO[3] ^- is greater than the
   delta anion gap, then a concomitant non-anion gap acidosis must exist
   as outlined above. The relevant differential includes Diarrhea (no
   significant in history), RTA,  andpancreaticoduodenal fistula.
   So, let
s synthesize the above, and then try to incorporate the new 24
   hour event. The patient has both a gap and non-anion gap acidosis.
   Common causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is excluded
   by K, but RTA type I requires urine PH. So we need a urine PH to r/I or
   r/o this diagnosis, which would account for the anion gap component.
   Given the GI bleed and pancreatic enzyme elevation, the non-anion gap
   etiology is now more interesting. Both could be causing the non-anion
   gap component of the acidosis, with the RTA contributing as well.
   In short, the emerging DDx for Anion gap Acidosis is RTA. Emerging diff
   for Non-Anion gap acidosis is pancreaticoduodenal fistula in light of
   pancreatic enzyme elevation and upper GI bleed. Of note, from an
   anatomic perspective, a pancreaticoduodenal fistula is not far from the
   Ligament of Treitz, and so such a fistula, if inflamed and hemorrhagic,
   could account for the coffe ground emesis. In this regard, we have an
   emerging unifying diagnosis that nicely fits with the Acid-Base picture
   (we now have a multi-factorial (4 causes) etiology to her metabolic
   derangements.
   -To confirm, f/u CT Abdomen
   -obtain urine pH
   -trend pancreatic enzymes
   ###Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Unclear etiology, but perhaps
   pancreaticoduodenal fistula if present? Patient does not have clear
   risk factors as is s/p cholecystectomy and no known history of
   alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - aggressive hydration
   - followup read of CT scan with our radiologists
    - NGT to suction for now
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lactate
   ###Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to severe infection and
   acute renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities.  Now moving
   slightly to voice and withdrawing to pain.  Non contrast head CT was
   negative for bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   - serum toxicology positive only for tricyclics, will obtain urine tox
   if possible
   ###Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now in the setting
   of hypotension.
   ###Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   ###Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Seen on
   laboratories.
   - insulin sliding scale
   ###Anemia/Upper GI bleed:  Related to ?pancreaticoduodenal fistula?.
   Ostomy output is guaiac positive.  Unclear baseline.  Normocytic.
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   -ensure two large boar IV
   ###FEN: LR for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes,
   bicarbonate as needed, NPO, NGT to suction
   ###Prophylaxis: SC heparin, PPI
   ###Access: Right femoral line (will need to be changed), left a-line

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient was found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Shock: The patient initially presented with signs of shock, including hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. It is important to monitor the patient's vital signs and ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely secondary to shock. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels. Further investigations, such as repeat ABG and assessment of urine pH, are needed to determine the underlying cause.

3. Non-anion gap acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis, which could be caused by gastrointestinal losses or a pancreaticoduodenal fistula. Additional tests, such as urine pH and CT abdomen, are required to confirm the diagnosis.

4. Elevated Pancreatic Enzymes: The patient's elevated pancreatic enzymes may indicate acute pancreatitis or a pancreaticoduodenal fistula. Trending pancreatic enzyme levels and further imaging studies, such as a CT abdomen, will help determine the underlying cause.

 SHOCK, OTHER
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   ###Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and
   bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology. Off pressors but
   sub-optimal urine output. Concern for severe infection, but now lactate
   = 1 and WBC
s trending down slowly..  In terms of infecious etiologies
   the most likely source would be the urine given grossly positive
   urinalysis, but urine culture is negative in context of positive UA. No
   evidence to suggest blood loss as an etiology at this time, blood coffe
   ground emesis only just noted.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics with (vancomycin) and cefepime,
   Ceftriaxone.
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - Left sided effusion versus mass on CXR noted.  Unfortunately cannot
   find CD from outside hospital. Will need to obtain or repeat.
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend leukocytosis, lactate
   ###Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunately
   urine output not especially responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis
   grossly positive for infection, but culture negative. With FeNa = 1%
   (borderline), so difficult to distinguish between pre-renal and
   intrinsic. However, given minimal improvement with fluid boluses,
   together with Urine Na under 25 and urine Cl under 25, there is likely
   less of a pre-renal component and we must increasingly suspecting
   intrinsic failures. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan
   to suggest post-renal obstruction.
   -acidemia improving 7.33-7.88 with bicarb, so no indication for HD at
   this time
   -recheck ABG this PM and give [**1-30**] AMPS bicarb if needed.
   ###Non-anion gap acidosis: Today, pH = 7.38 from 7.33, so acidosis
   improving. Anion Gap = 11 when not corrected for albumin (this
   correction does not appear to me to usually be done in these analysis
   for reasons that are not clear to me) , so by this measure alone, this
   is a non-anion gap acidosis.  (If corrected, lower limit nl appears ?
   8.5). The Delta delta, however,  (change in bicarb = 22 while change in
   anion gap much less), suggests that  a concomitant non-anion gap
   acidosis exists.  So, let
s consider the differential for both
   Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1, which makes the
   differential RTA type I (but we lack a urine pH, so cannot confirm with
   range 5.5-6), vs. RTA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making this less
   likely). In short, with regards to the Anion gap differential, GI
   losses as etiology appear lower on the differential, and an intrinsic
   etiology, as also suggested above by urine lytes discussed under the
renal
 section, appears likely.
   2) Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: If the delta HCO[3] ^- is greater than the
   delta anion gap, then a concomitant non-anion gap acidosis must exist
   as outlined above. The relevant differential includes Diarrhea (no
   significant in history), RTA,  andpancreaticoduodenal fistula.
   So, let
s synthesize the above, and then try to incorporate the new 24
   hour event. The patient has both a gap and non-anion gap acidosis.
   Common causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is excluded
   by K, but RTA type I requires urine PH. So we need a urine PH to r/I or
   r/o this diagnosis, which would account for the anion gap component.
   Given the GI bleed and pancreatic enzyme elevation, the non-anion gap
   etiology is now more interesting. Both could be causing the non-anion
   gap component of the acidosis, with the RTA contributing as well.
   In short, the emerging DDx for Anion gap Acidosis is RTA. Emerging diff
   for Non-Anion gap acidosis is pancreaticoduodenal fistula in light of
   pancreatic enzyme elevation and upper GI bleed. Of note, from an
   anatomic perspective, a pancreaticoduodenal fistula is not far from the
   Ligament of Treitz, and so such a fistula, if inflamed and hemorrhagic,
   could account for the coffe ground emesis. In this regard, we have an
   emerging unifying diagnosis that nicely fits with the Acid-Base picture
   (we now have a multi-factorial (4 causes) etiology to her metabolic
   derangements.
   -To confirm, f/u CT Abdomen
   -obtain urine pH
   -trend pancreatic enzymes
   ###Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Unclear etiology, but perhaps
   pancreaticoduodenal fistula if present? Patient does not have clear
   risk factors as is s/p cholecystectomy and no known history of
   alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - aggressive hydration
   - followup read of CT scan with our radiologists
    - NGT to suction for now
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lactate
   ###Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to severe infection and
   acute renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities.  Now moving
   slightly to voice and withdrawing to pain.  Non contrast head CT was
   negative for bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   - serum toxicology positive only for tricyclics, will obtain urine tox
   if possible
   ###Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now in the setting
   of hypotension.
   ###Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   ###Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Seen on
   laboratories.
   - insulin sliding scale
   ###Anemia/Upper GI bleed:  Related to ?pancreaticoduodenal fistula?.
   Ostomy output is guaiac positive.  Unclear baseline.  Normocytic.
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   -ensure two large boar IV
   ###FEN: LR for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes,
   bicarbonate as needed, NPO, NGT to suction
   ###Prophylaxis: SC heparin, PPI
   ###Access: Right femoral line (will need to be changed), left a-line

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient was found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 108/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on invasive ventilation support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin-T levels. The urine output is low at 350 mL in the past 24 hours. The blood glucose level is also significantly elevated at 356 mg/dL.

The patient has been diagnosed with shock of unclear etiology, mixed acidosis (both anion gap and non-anion gap), acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The acidosis is improving with bicarbonate administration. The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes, which may suggest a pancreaticoduodenal fistula. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status likely due to severe infection, acute renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require careful monitoring and management. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure,"

 SHOCK, OTHER
 ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   ###Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and
   bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology. Off pressors but
   sub-optimal urine output, now improving. Concern for severe infection,
   but now lactate = 1 and WBC
s =12
13.8.  In terms of infecious
   etiologies the most likely source would be the urine given grossly
   positive urinalysis, but urine culture is negative in context of
   positive UA. No evidence to suggest blood loss as an etiology at this
   time, blood coffe ground emesis minimal
   - broad spectrum antibiotics with (vancomycin) and cefepime,
   Ceftriaxone.
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend leukocytosis, lactate
   ###Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Unfortunately
   urine output not especially responsive to fluid boluses.  Urinalysis
   grossly positive for infection, but culture negative. With FeNa = 1%
   (borderline), so difficult to distinguish between pre-renal and
   intrinsic. However, given minimal improvement with fluid boluses,
   together with Urine urine Cl under 25, there is likely less of a
   pre-renal component and we must increasingly suspecting intrinsic
   failures. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan to suggest
   post-renal obstruction.
   -acidemia improving 7.33-7.88 now at 7.4 with no bicarb overnight, so
   no indication for HD at this time
   -recheck ABG this PM and give [**1-30**] AMPS bicarb if needed.
   ###Non-anion gap acidosis: Today, pH = 7.4, so acidosis improving.
   Anion Gap = 11 yesterday when not corrected for albumin (this
   correction does not appear to me to usually be done in these analysis
   for reasons that are not clear to me) , so by this measure alone, this
   is a non-anion gap acidosis.  (If corrected, lower limit nl appears ?
   8.5). The Delta delta, however,  (change in bicarb = 22 while change in
   anion gap much less), suggests that  a concomitant non-anion gap
   acidosis exists.  So, let
s consider the differential for both
   Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1 (yesterday), which
   makes the differential RTA type I (urine pH is 5, is usually, with
   range 5.5-6 in type I), vs. RTA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making
   this less likely). In short, with regards to the Anion gap
   differential, GI losses as etiology appear lower on the differential,
   and an intrinsic etiology, as also suggested above by urine lytes
   discussed under the
renal
 section, appears likely.
   2) Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: If the delta HCO[3] ^- is greater than the
   delta anion gap, then a concomitant non-anion gap acidosis must exist
   as outlined above. The relevant differential includes Diarrhea (no
   significant in history), RTA,  andpancreaticoduodenal fistula., but
   there is no evidence of pancreatic fistual on CT.
   So, the patient has both a gap and non-anion gap acidosis. Common
   causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is excluded by K,
   but RTA type I remains possibility, perhaps together with some earlier
   volume depletion.
   ###Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Pancreatitis on CT.  Enzymes trending
   down. Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p
   cholecystectomy and no known history of alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - aggressive hydration
   - followup read of CT scan with our radiologists
    - NGT to suction for now
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lactate
   ###Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to infection and acute
   renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities..  Non contrast head CT
   was negative for bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   - serum toxicology positive only for tricyclics, will obtain urine tox
   if possible
   ###Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now in the setting
   of hypotension.
   ###Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   ###Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Seen on
   laboratories.
   - insulin sliding scale
   ###Anemia/Upper GI bleed:  Related to ?pancreaticoduodenal fistula?.
   Ostomy output is guaiac positive.  Unclear baseline.  Normocytic.
   - active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   -ensure two large boar IV
   ###FEN: LR for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes,
   bicarbonate as needed, NPO, NGT to suction
   ###Prophylaxis: SC heparin, PPI
   ###Access: Right femoral line (will need to be changed), left a-line

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who presented from Hospital6 with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. She has acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. She was found to have a pancreaticoduodenal fistula, possibly due to pancreatitis. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, but it was successfully extubated on am rounds yesterday. She has a tracheostomy and is on a feeding tube. She is experiencing non-anion gap acidosis and mixed acid-base disorders. Her mental status is altered, possibly secondary to infection and acute renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities. The patient also has anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be related to the pancreaticoduodenal fistula. She has hyperglycemia and hypertension, and her blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a possibility of further deterioration. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte imbalances is necessary.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes and evidence of pancreatitis on CT scan. This condition can lead to complications such as abscess formation, pseudocyst, or necrosis.

3. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and positive urinalysis suggest an ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and blood and urine cultures are"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   ###Shock: Inactive issue, save white count that has not resolved. Now
   controlling hypertension via Nifedipine.
   ###Infection: WBC slightly elevated today at 16. No real improvement on
   Cefepime and Vanco. Not clear just what we are treating.
   -D/C Cefepime
   -con
t f/u blood and urine cultures pending
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - trend WBC's. Let
s get a lactate tomorrow.
   ###Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Urine Output 470
   over last 24 hours. Urinalysis was grossly positive for infection, but
   culture negative. With FeNa = 1% (borderline), so difficult to
   distinguish between pre-renal and intrinsic. However, given minimal
   improvement with fluid boluses, together with Urine urine Cl under 25,
   there is likely less of a pre-renal component and we must increasingly
   suspecting intrinsic failures. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis
   on CT scan to suggest post-renal obstruction.
   -acidemia was improving 7.33-7.88  at 7.4 most recently, with no bicarb
   overnight, so no indication for HD at this time
   -recheck ABG this AM, bicarb if needed.
   ###Non-anion gap acidosis: The Delta delta, however,  (change in bicarb
   = 22 while change in anion gap much less), suggests that  a concomitant
   non-anion gap acidosis exists.  So, let's consider the differential for
   both Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1 (yesterday), which
   makes the differential RTA type I (urine pH is 5, is usually, with
   range 5.5-6 in type I), vs. RTA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making
   this less likely). In short, with regards to the Anion gap
   differential, GI losses as etiology appear lower on the differential,
   and an intrinsic etiology, as also suggested above by urine lytes
   discussed under the ""renal"" section, appears likely.
   2) Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: If the delta HCO[3] ^- is greater than the
   delta anion gap, then a concomitant non-anion gap acidosis must exist
   as outlined above. The relevant differential includes Diarrhea (no
   significant in history), RTA,  andpancreaticoduodenal fistula., but
   there is no evidence of pancreatic fistual on CT.
   So, the patient has both a gap and non-anion gap acidosis. Common
   causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is excluded by K,
   but RTA type I remains possibility, perhaps together with some earlier
   volume depletion.
   -plan as under renal failure section
   -per renal, strive for euvolemia.
   ###Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Pancreatitis on CT.  Enzymes trending
   down. Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p
   cholecystectomy and no known history of alcoholism.  Exam unremarkable.
   Resolving issue.
   - No further reason to trend enzymes.
    - NGT to suction for now
   - do not exceed moderate fluids given LE edema, resolving pancreatitis
   - trend lactate
   ###Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to infection and acute
   renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities..  Non contrast head CT
   was negative for bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   ###Hypertension: Con
t Nifedipine crushed through NG tube. Will need to
   transistion over to her 30 of extended release once she can tolerate
   PO
   ###Schizoaffective disorder:
   - holding all medications for now given altered mental status
   ###Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.
   - insulin sliding scale
   ###Anemia/Upper GI bleed:  One time event w/ only 300cc's total. Ostomy
   output was guaiac positive, but virtually no drop in HCT.  Will
   monitor, but will not consult GI given limited event and setting of
   acute illness.
   -maintain active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   -ensure two large boar IV's
   ###FEN: LR for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes,
   bicarbonate as needed, NPO, NGT to suction

   ###Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Urine Output 470
   over last 24 hours. Urinalysis was grossly positive for infection, but
   culture negative. With FeNa = 1% (borderline), so difficult to
   distinguish between pre-renal and intrinsic. However, given minimal
   improvement with fluid boluses, together with Urine urine Cl under 25,
   there is likely less of a pre-renal component and we must increasingly
   suspecting intrinsic failures. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis
   on CT scan to suggest post-renal obstruction.
   -acidemia was improving 7.33-7.88  at 7.4 most recently, with no bicarb
   overnight, so no indication for HD at this time.
   -Recheck gas today, Bicarb if needed.
   ###Non-anion gap acidosis: The Delta delta,   (change in bicarb = 22
   while change in anion gap much less), earlier suggested that  a
   concomitant non-anion gap acidosis exists.  At that time we considered
   the differential for both Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1 (yesterday), which
   makes the differential RTA type I (urine pH is 5, is usually, with
   range 5.5-6 in type I), vs. RTA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making
   this less likely). In short, with regards to the Anion gap
   differential, GI losses as etiology appear lower on the differential,
   and an intrinsic etiology, as also suggested above by urine lytes
   discussed under the ""renal"" section, appears likely.
   2) Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: If the delta HCO[3] ^- is greater than the
   delta anion gap, then a concomitant non-anion gap acidosis must exist
   as outlined above. The relevant differential includes Diarrhea (no
   significant in history), RTA,  andpancreaticoduodenal fistula., but
   there is no evidence of pancreatic fistual on CT.
    So, on admission, the patient has both a gap and non-anion gap
   acidosis. Common causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is
   excluded by K, but RTA type I remains possibility, perhaps together
   with some earlier volume depletion.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who presented from another hospital with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. She was found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. The patient's current condition includes hypertension, impaired skin integrity, shock, mixed acidosis, and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 108/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the left base, soft ostomy with liquid stool in the right lower quadrant, minimal cloudy urine, and well-demarcated erythematous and edematous left hand with three well-formed blisters.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.7 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 6.3 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.02. The patient's electrolyte levels are as follows: sodium 112 mg/dL, potassium 3.0 mEq/L, chloride 95 mEq/L, bicarbonate 18 mEq/L, glucose 112 mg/dL, BUN 23.0 mg/dL, and creatinine 6.3 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypertension, impaired skin integrity, shock, mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient is currently being treated with nifedipine for hypertension, cefepime for infection, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin for prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening renal failure, development of sepsis, progression of skin integrity impairment leading to infection or further tissue damage, worsening acidosis, and worsening respiratory failure."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis. She was admitted to the ICU from another hospital with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with signs of shock, including hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. Although the patient is currently stable, there is a possibility of recurrence if not closely monitored.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has shown signs of acute renal failure, as indicated by decreased urine output and abnormal laboratory results. This condition requires close monitoring and management.
3. Non-anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has both anion gap and non-anion gap acidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes and evidence of pancreatitis on CT scan. Monitoring the patient's enzyme levels is essential to assess the progress of the condition.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to electrolyte abnormalities resulting from acute renal failure. Frequent monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances are necessary.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that needs to be managed with antihyp"

   Continues to do well off the ventilator. Oxygenation adequate off

   Hypotension no longer an issue. Anti-hypertensives started.
   No evidence of bleeding. Hct low, just above our usual transfusion
   threshold. Given her lethargy, however, I would suggest transfusion
   today.
   Patient is on day 4 of antibiotics. Not clear what is the source of
   infection. Cultures have been unrevealing. There was some concern about
   an aspiration pneumonia on admission. Will change antibiotics for more
   specific coverage of aspiration pneumonia.
   Renal failure unchanged. Electrolytes and acid-base status acceptable.
   Mental status still does not appear to be at baseline. She is awake and
   responds to voice but is not communicative this AM. This may reflect,
   in part, uremia as well as her underlying psychiatric illness. Continue
   to monitor. Consider pyschiatry consult. Patient had CT on admission.
   Consider repeat.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   ###Shock: Inactive issue, save white count that has not resolved. Now
   controlling hypertension via Nifedipine.
   ###Infection: WBC slightly elevated today at 16. Tmax, 99.5. No real
   improvement on Cefepime and Vanco. Switched to, Flagyl, Zosyn
   yesterday.   ?of Right Lower lobe PNA on CXR, but CT chest not
   suggestive (pleural effusions only). CT head raises possibility of
   sinus infection as cause of sub-acute increase in WBC
s, bot not
   earlier shock.  Pancreatitis does not appear to include superinfection.

   -con
t f/u blood and urine cultures pending
   -culture if spikes
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   ###Acute Renal Failure:  Likely secondary to shock.  Urine Output 470
   over last 24 hours. Urinalysis was grossly positive for infection, but
   culture negative. With FeNa = 1% (borderline), so difficult to
   distinguish between pre-renal and intrinsic. However, given minimal
   improvement with fluid boluses, together with Urine urine Cl under 25,
   there is likely less of a pre-renal component and we must increasingly
   suspecting intrinsic failures. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis
   on CT scan to suggest post-renal obstruction.
   -improving with Creatinine 6.3
5.5.
   -Gas likewise improving w. pH 7.37, pCO2 32 (from 38) and po2 86
   ###Non-anion gap acidosis: The Delta delta,   (change in bicarb = 22
   while change in anion gap much less), earlier suggested that  a
   concomitant non-anion gap acidosis exists.  At that time we considered
   the differential for both Non-anion gap acidosis and gap acidosis:
   1) Anion gap differential: The urine anion gap = 1 (yesterday), which
   makes the differential RTA type I (urine pH is 5, is usually, with
   range 5.5-6 in type I), vs. RTA Type 4 (but K is not elevated, making
   this less likely). In short, with regards to the Anion gap
   differential, GI losses as etiology appear lower on the differential,
   and an intrinsic etiology, as also suggested above by urine lytes
   discussed under the ""renal"" section, appears likely.
   2) Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: If the delta HCO[3] ^- is greater than the
   delta anion gap, then a concomitant non-anion gap acidosis must exist
   as outlined above. The relevant differential includes Diarrhea (no
   significant in history), RTA,  andpancreaticoduodenal fistula., but
   there is no evidence of pancreatic fistual on CT.
    So, on admission, the patient has both a gap and non-anion gap
   acidosis. Common causes within each category include RTA. RTA type 4 is
   excluded by K, but RTA type I remains possibility, perhaps together
   with some earlier volume depletion.
   -plan as under renal failure section
   -per renal, strive for euvolemia.

   ###Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Pancreatitis on CT.  Enzymes trending
   down. Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p
   cholecystectomy and no known history of alcoholism.  Exam unremarkable.
   Resolving issue.
   - No further reason to trend enzymes.
    - NGT to suction for now
   - do not exceed moderate fluids given LE edema, resolving pancreatitis
   ###Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to infection and acute
   renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities..  Non contrast head CT
   was negative for bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   would include repeat head CT (question of facial droop at home
   reported)
   ###Hypertension: Con
t Nifedipine crushed through NG tube. Will need to
   transition over to her 30 of extended release once she can tolerate
   PO
   ###Schizoaffective disorder:
   -Pt has been off psych meds.  Cont to hold per psych.
   f/u RPR, B-12, EEG
   ###Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Has required
   minimal insulin.
   - insulin sliding scale continues
   ###Anemia/Upper GI bleed:  One time event w/ only 300cc's total. Ostomy
   output was guaiac positive, but virtually no drop in HCT.  Will
   monitor, but will not consult GI given limited event and setting of
   acute illness.
   -maintain active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   -ensure two large boar IV's
   ###FEN: LR for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes,
   bicarbonate as needed, NPO, NGT to suction
   ###Prophylaxis: SC heparin, PPI
   ###Access: picc, arterial line, 20 gauge.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis. She presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension, along with acute renal failure, severe acidosis, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypertension, impaired skin integrity, shock, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The assessment and plan section of the note outlines various issues such as infection, acute renal failure, non-anion gap acidosis, elevated pancreatic enzymes, altered mental status, schizoaffective disorder, hyperglycemia, anemia/upper GI bleed, and fluid electrolyte imbalance.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of shock and an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible ongoing infection. This can lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's urine output is low, and there are signs of infection in the urine. This may indicate intrinsic renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

3. Acidosis: The patient has mixed acidosis (both anion gap and non-anion gap), which requires careful management to correct the underlying cause and prevent further complications.

4. Elevated pancreatic enzymes: Although the patient's pancreatitis appears to be resolving"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder admitted to the ICU. She presented with altered mental status and was found to have aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including cefipime, metronidazole, and Zosyn. She also has severe coronary artery calcifications and trace ascites. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/65 to 153/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Her flowsheet data shows a fluid balance of 2,922 mL in and 1,535 mL out, with a total intake of 2,922 mL and a total output of 1,535 mL. Her respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, occasional one-word expressions, and nods occasionally. No acute distress is observed. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium and bicarbonate levels. Other lab values, such as liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and cardiac markers, are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with hypertension, impaired skin integrity, shock (other), mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren 2.0, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and abnormal electrolyte levels, indicating potential renal impairment. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and uremic symptoms.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is on supplemental oxygen. If her respiratory function deteriorates further, she may require mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
3. Skin integrity issues: The patient has impaired skin integrity with erythematous and blister-like stigmata on her right hand. This can lead to increased risk of infection and pressure ulcers.
4. Shock: The patient is diagnosed with shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion. It can be caused by various factors such as hypovolemia, sepsis, or cardiac dysfunction.
5. Mixed acidosis: The patient's blood gases show a mixed acid-base disturbance. This can result in symptoms such as weakness, confusion, and abnormal heart rhythms.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   70 year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents
   from [**Hospital6 **] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension
   found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, all of which are resolving.
   ###Shock: Inactive issue, save white count that has not resolved. Now
   controlling hypertension via Nifedipine.
   ###Infection: WBC trending down at 13.2. Tmax, 99.4, on Azithromycin
   day 2 for presumed sinus infeciton.   ?of Right Lower lobe PNA on CXR,
   but CT chest not suggestive (pleural effusions only). CT head raises
   possibility of sinus infection as cause of sub-acute increase in WBC
   bot not earlier shock.  Pancreatitis does not appear to include
   superinfection.
   -Azithromycin
   -con
t f/u blood and urine cultures pending
   -culture if spikes
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - LR boluses for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   ###Acute Renal Failure:  4.6 today down from 6.3 on admission.
   Excellent urine output!
   RTA type 4 is excluded by K, but RTA type I remains possibility,
   perhaps together with some earlier volume depletion.
    -con
t f/u renal recs
   ###: Hyponatremia: Rapid drop s/p 3L of fluids in overnight.
   -Hold further free water fluids.
   -Free water restrict.
   -Recheck this afternoon and evening
   ###Elevated pancreatic enzymes:  Pancreatitis on CT.  Enzymes trending
   down. Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p
   cholecystectomy and no known history of alcoholism.  Exam unremarkable.
   Resolving issue.
   - No further reason to trend enzymes.
    - NGT to suction for now
   - do not exceed moderate fluids given LE edema, resolving pancreatitis
   ###Altered Mental Status:  Likely secondary to infection and acute
   renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities..  Non contrast head CT
   was negative for bleed.
   - follow up cultures
   - holding sedating medications
   - additional workup if no improvement with control of her infection
   would include repeat head CT (question of facial droop at home
   reported)
   ###Hypertension: Con
t Nifedipine crushed through NG tube. Will need to
   transition over to her 30 of extended release once she can tolerate
   PO
   ###Schizoaffective disorder:
   -Pt has been off psych meds.  Cont to hold per psych.
   -RPR, B-12, EEG unremarkable
   ###Hyperglycemia:  No documented history of diabetes.  Has required
   minimal insulin.
   - insulin sliding scale continues
   ###Anemia/Upper GI bleed:  One time event w/ only 300cc's total. Ostomy
   output was guaiac positive, but virtually no drop in HCT.  Will
   monitor, but will not consult GI given limited event and setting of
   acute illness.
   -maintain active type and screen
   - transfusion goal of > 21
   -ensure two large boar IV's
   ###FEN: LR for MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes,
   bicarbonate as needed, NPO, NGT to suction

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who presented with hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypertension, impaired skin integrity, shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/62 mmHg to 158/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. Her mental status is altered but not delirious.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a suspected sinus infection, as indicated by a positive urinalysis and elevated white blood cell count. She is currently receiving antibiotic therapy with azithromycin.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving, with a decreasing serum creatinine level from 6.3 on admission to 4.6 today. However, she requires ongoing monitoring and management of her renal function.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes, suggesting pancreatitis. Although her enzymes are trending down, it is important to continue monitoring her condition.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has had episodes of hypernatremia and hyponatremia. Close"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypertension and impaired skin integrity. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including shock, mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/61 mmHg to 158/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,269 mL, including 1,027 mL through the PO, 331 mL through TF, 2,028 mL through IVF, and output of 1,130 mL through blood products, 570 mL through urine, 260 mL through NG, and 200 mL through stool. The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, platelet count of 106 K/uL, creatinine level of 6.3 mg/dL, glucose level of 95 mg/dL, and sodium level of 476 mg/dL. The patient's assessment and plan include hypertension, impaired skin integrity, shock, mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, and probable toxic metabolic encephalopathy. The patient requires free water repletion, anti-hypertensive medications, and removal of the NG tube with placement of a smaller feeding tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 6.3 mg/dL, indicating impaired kidney function. This can lead to further deterioration of renal function if not managed appropriately.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may increase the risk of pneumonia or other respiratory infections, particularly due to the presence of an NG tube.

3. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure readings indicate uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage if not managed effectively.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium level (476 mg/dL) indicates hypernatremia, which can result in neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even coma if not corrected promptly.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores, which can be difficult to treat and may lead to infection or sepsis if not managed properly.

6. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and CT findings suggesting sinusitis indicate a possible infection. If left untreated, this can progress and lead to sepsis or septic shock.

7. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status has improved, there is still a risk of delirium due to the presence of multiple comorbidities and ICU environment.

8. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to impaired skin integrity, reduced oral intake, and potential use of a feeding tube. Malnutrition can impede the healing process and increase the risk of complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage these potential complications to improve the patient's outcome."

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. They have hypertension, impaired skin integrity, shock, mixed acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient's blood pressure is being managed with anti-hypertensives, and their mental status has improved. Hemodynamics are stable, and efforts are being made to correct hypernatremia. The patient also has a swollen hand that appears to be improving and a PICC line that infiltrated and was discontinued. A CT scan suggests sinusitis, and the patient is on day 2 of a 10-day course of azithromycin. The patient is receiving renal diet nutrition and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
2. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications like heart attack or stroke if not properly managed.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of infection and pressure ulcers.
4. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Mixed acidosis: The patient has mixed acidosis,"
