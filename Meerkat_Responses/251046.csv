   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with abscess
   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep
   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. ID and CT
   surgery following. Clinically improved and stable for now on IV ABx.
   .
   # EVENTS: [**2201-2-23**]
   -          spiked fever, infected pacemaker removed
   .
   #Fever/Leukocytosis: Spiking for last 3 days, ID following, concerning
   for worsening of disease vs complication
   -f/u ID rec for repeat Echo to assess for complication such as abscess
   -f/u BCx, UCx
   -continue Penicillin G for now
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve - most likely
   source is from bilateral foot ulcers which also grew group B Strep.
   Plan is for patient to go to surgery at some point although need to
   stabilize patient on IV antibiotics and completely rule out additional
   infectious sources prior to OR. ID and CV surgery have been following.
   Repeat TTE from [**2-16**] unchanged from previous [**2-10**]. Ophthalmologic eval
   negative for endophthalmitis (+ vitreous hemorrhage old)
   - TEE showed stable aortic disease and worsening R heart vegetation on
   pacer wires now involving the tricuspid valve
   - Continue Penicillin G Potassium 4 million units IV Q4H.
   - Audiology appt Tues [**2-24**] 3:30pm at [**Hospital Ward Name 4486**] Med Bldg, Suite 6E with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 4487**]. Pt needs to arrive 15m early. [**1-/7692**]-can be cancelled as he is
   no longer on Gentamycin.
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 3**] following. Of note, patient will need 4 teeth extracted prior
   to surgery which currently he is refusing
   - plan for meeting of the minds today  with CT surgery, cardiology
   including CCU / EP and ID to discuss management with this case
   .
   # Infected Pacer Leads-EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - continue to monitor for oozing from the site
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure - baseline Cr here apppears to be
   1.3-1.5 peaked to 2.2 this am in setting of procedure, being NPO with
   minimal intake after.  Likely pre-renal.
   -bolused 1L NS, started maintenance fluids NS 150cc/hr
   - follow cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 Resolved, on room air.  Weaning off of oxygen,
   requires O2 at night for apnea.
   - consider outpatient CPAP as needed
   .
   # Anemia
 Likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors.
   Persistently low retic count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site overnight.
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root, CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving IV antibiotics.

The patient's recent events include the removal of an infected pacemaker, development of fever and leukocytosis, and worsening of disease or complication. There is also a plan for repeat Echo to assess for complications such as abscess. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been taken. The patient's group B Strep endocarditis with prosthetic aortic valve is likely due to bilateral foot ulcers which also grew group B Strep. The plan is for the patient to undergo surgery once stabilized on IV antibiotics and after ruling out additional infectious sources.

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, low hemoglobin, elevated CRP, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension and tachypnea.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of endocarditis, development of septicemia, renal failure, respiratory failure, anemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information and additional clinical assessment would be required for a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis involving the aortic valve homograft and infected pacemaker leads. The patient underwent removal of the infected pacemaker leads by EP and temporary pacer placement. He is currently on IV antibiotics and being closely monitored. The patient's fever and leukocytosis have been concerning for worsening of disease or complications. There are also concerns about acute on chronic renal failure, likely pre-renal due to the recent procedures and minimal intake. The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he is now on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen at night. Anemia is likely due to blood loss and inflammation. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of endocarditis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a potential worsening of the group B strep endocarditis. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which may progress if not managed appropriately. Monitoring renal function and adjusting fluid and medication management accordingly is crucial.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of oozing from the pacer site and is on anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring for signs of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. He has a diagnosis of group B strep endocarditis with an infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient has undergone debridement of the infected pacemaker leads and temporary pacing has been established. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 60 bpm (with VVI pacing), blood pressure ranging from 83/30 mmHg to 154/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. He is currently receiving invasive ventilation, PICC line, arterial line, and has undergone blood cultures, urine culture, and nasal swab.

The patient's physical examination reveals dilated pupils, poor dentition, and clear breath sounds. His extremities show trace edema on both sides. Neurologically, he is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, sodium level of 135 mg/d"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. He has undergone a procedure to remove an infected pacemaker and temporarily paced. The patient is currently being treated for group B strep endocarditis with an infected pacemaker and aortic valve. He is also experiencing acute-on-chronic renal failure, respiratory failure (resolved), anemia (likely due to blood loss and inflammation), and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient is currently being treated for group B strep endocarditis with an infected pacemaker and aortic valve. This condition can lead to further complications such as heart valve damage, heart failure, or systemic infection.
2. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level appears to be 1.3-1.5, which has peaked to 2.2 this morning. This acute rise in creatinine suggests acute-on-chronic renal failure, possibly due to the recent procedure or other factors. It is important to monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust fluid and medication management accordingly.
3. Anemia: The patient has persistently low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin, indicating anemia likely due to blood loss and inflammation. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels"

   Echo: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
   aortic valve appears to be a homograft. There is focal thickening of
   the aortic root and ascending aorta consistent with known history of
   aortic replacement. There is a probable vegetation on the aortic valve,
   which is difficult to appreciate. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Moderate aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
   eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient has shown clinical improvement on IV antibiotics but continues to have persistently spiking fevers after the removal of the pacer lead. He also has a history of acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of group B strep endocarditis with possible complications such as abscess or fistula formation.
2. Possible pulmonary infection due to recent coughing and sputum with polys.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI) with dirty urinalysis.
4. Pre-renal acute kidney injury due to inadequate fluid intake.
5. Anemia potentially caused by blood loss and inflammation.
6. Diabetes mellitus type 2 management.
7. Possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility.
8. Stress ulcer prophylaxis.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

   Echo: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
   aortic valve appears to be a homograft. There is focal thickening of
   the aortic root and ascending aorta consistent with known history of
   aortic replacement. There is a probable vegetation on the aortic valve,
   which is difficult to appreciate. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Moderate aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
   eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-2-16**], the

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He also has chronic heart block (CHB) with a permanent pacemaker (PPM). The patient was diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis involving the aortic valve homograft. After receiving intravenous antibiotics (ABx), his condition improved, but he still has persistently spiking fevers. The patient had the infected pacemaker leads removed, and temporary pacing was placed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient's spiking fevers could indicate worsening of the endocarditis or a possible complication such as abscess formation.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, which may be due to pre-renal azotemia caused by decreased urine output.
3. Infected Pacer Leads: Although the infected pacemaker leads were removed, there is a risk of infection at the pacer site, which needs close monitoring.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure but has been successfully weaned off oxygen. However, he still requires supplemental oxygen at night.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss during procedures and inflammation. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He is currently in the ICU with group B strep endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient's clinical condition has improved on IV antibiotics but he continues to have persistently spiking fevers after the removal of the pacer lead. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has an active infection of the aortic valve caused by group B strep bacteria. This infection is serious and can lead to further complications if not treated appropriately.

2. Worsening Aortic Insufficiency (AI): The patient's aortic valve is showing signs of worsening AI, as indicated by the echocardiogram. This condition can lead to heart failure and other cardiac complications if left untreated.

3. Infected Pacer Leads: The patient had infected pacemaker leads, which were removed on [**2201-2-24**]. There is a risk of ongoing infection or complications related to the pacemaker site.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating renal impairment. The recent procedure and minimal intake may have contributed to acute kidney injury. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient is currently on intravenous antibiotics and is clinically improved and stable. However, he has been experiencing spiking fevers for the past three days, which is concerning for worsening of the disease or a complication. The patient's recent transthoracic echo showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal overall left ventricular systolic function, right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal, and there is moderate aortic regurgitation. The patient has also undergone the removal of infected pacemaker leads and temporary pacer placement. Other ongoing issues include acute on chronic renal failure, resolved respiratory failure, anemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 106/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a weight of unknown pounds. They are currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of coughing and emesis. The patient has a history of valve replacement, specifically an aortic bioprosthesis, and has been experiencing spiking fevers. They have also had a recent episode of respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, cardiac device infection (pacemaker and defibrillator), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aortic valve vegetation: The patient has a known history of aortic valve replacement, and the trans-thoracic echo reveals a probable vegetation on the aortic valve. This could indicate infective endocarditis, which can lead to further complications such as valve dysfunction or systemic infection.
2. Moderate aortic regurgitation: The echo also shows moderate aortic regurgitation, where the aortic valve does not close properly, leading to backward flow of blood into the left ventricle. Over time, this can result in left ventricular remodeling and heart failure.
3. Mild mitral regurgitation: The echo indicates mild mitral regurgitation, where blood leaks backward through the mitral valve during systole. This can lead to volume overload in the left atrium and ventricle.
4. Renal failure: The patient's blood"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. The patient has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient is currently being treated with intravenous antibiotics but continues to have persistently spiking fevers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of endocarditis: The patient's persistent fevers could indicate a worsening of the endocarditis, which may require surgical intervention.

2. Abscess formation: A repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to evaluate for abscess formation. This is a potential complication of endocarditis and could necessitate further surgical intervention.

3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level appears to be within normal range but peaked to 2.2 after a procedure. This suggests acute on chronic renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal azotemia. The patient received a bolus of 500cc and was transfused with one unit of blood. Close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.

4. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia due to blood loss and inflammation. Pantoprazole is being continued to prevent stress ulcers. Type and screen is up to date, and the patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. The patient also has CHB (complete heart block) with a permanent pacemaker (PPM) and is currently being treated for group B strep endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. 

The patient's recent symptoms include spiking fevers, cough, nausea, and emesis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 106/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, suggesting an ongoing infection. The blood culture results are pending, but previous cultures did not show any growth. The echocardiogram reveals moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, and a probable vegetation on the aortic valve. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an increase in creatinine level from 1.3-1.5 to 2.2. This may be due to pre-renal azotemia, possibly caused by dehydration or decreased renal perfusion."

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with moderate right coronary cusp vegetation, 2+ aortic regurgitation (AR), 2+ mitral regurgitation (MR), and small echolucent area adjacent to the non-coronary cusp, possibly an abscess. The patient received a dose of Penicillin G potassium on [date] at 04:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/60 mmHg to 73/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a first-degree AV block. The patient has received a total of 2,503 mL of fluids, including 816 mL of intravenous fluids, and has had a blood product transfusion of 375 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but within normal ranges for creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.41. The patient has a PICC line and an arterial line inserted on [date] at 06:40 PM and 06:42 PM, respectively. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's moderate right coronary cusp vegetation, 2+ aortic regurgitation, and 2+ mitral regurgitation indicate underlying heart valve issues, which may lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure or infective endocarditis.
2. Abscess formation: The presence of a small echolucent area adjacent to the non-coronary cusp suggests the possibility of an abscess, which can complicate the patient's condition and potentially spread to other areas.
3. Infection: Given the presence of vegetation on the heart valves, there is a risk of ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Bleeding complications: The use of heparin sodium for prophylaxis raises the risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the patient's elevated INR value.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support with a nasal cannula and the prophylaxis for VAP indicate the potential for respiratory infections or worsening respiratory function.
6. Fluid balance disturbances: The patient's fluid balance"

   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with abscess
   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep
   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. ID and CT
   surgery following. Clinically improved on IV ABx but persistently
   spiking fevers after pacer lead removal.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Aortic Valve Homograft. Repeat echo with
   worsening AI.
   - Continuing PCN, no gent given decreasing clearance. Changed PCN dose
   for GFR
   - TEE today to re-eval for abscess or fistula
   - At this time, operative risk is quite high, and we are continuing to
   follow with medical therapy given no hemodynamic compromise at this
   time. Abscess or fistula may change that.
   #Fever/Leukocytosis: Spiking for last 3 days, ID following, concerning
   for worsening of disease vs complication. OIther possible etiologies
   include pulm infection given recent coughing ad sputum with polys or
   UTI with dirty U/A
   -f/u ID rec for repeat TEE to assess for complication such as abscess
   -f/u BCx, UCx, sputum cx
   - Looking for other sources as above.
   - continue nafcillin for now; f/u with iD regarding broadening abx
   - chest CT today
   # Infected Pacer Leads-EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - continue to monitor for oozing from the site
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure - baseline Cr here apppears to be
   1.3-1.5 peaked to 2.2 this am in setting of procedure, being NPO with
   minimal intake after.  Likely pre-renal. Urine lytes consistent with
   prerenal azotemia. Bolused 500cc and transfused I unit
   - [**Month (only) 11**] be related to gent.
   - Trending Cr / Urine output. Was bolused and received blood yesterday
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 Resolved, on room air.  Weaning off of oxygen,
   requires O2 at night for apnea.
   - consider outpatient CPAP as needed
   .
   # Anemia
 Likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors.
   Persistently low retic count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site overnight but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 25, transfused 1 unit overnight. Rpt HCT
   20minutes after transfusion so not able to assess if appropriate bump

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has CHB s/p PPM and now presents with group B Strep endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient has been clinically improved on IV antibiotics but continues to have persistently spiking fevers after the removal of the pacer lead.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient's endocarditis is caused by group B Strep bacteria, which has infected the aortic valve homograft. There is a risk of worsening AI (aortic insufficiency) and abscess formation. A repeat echo is planned to re-evaluate for abscess or fistula.
2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing spiking fevers for the last three days, and the ID (Infectious Disease) team is following up. This could indicate worsening of the disease or a complication. Other possible etiologies include pulmonary infection, urinary tract infection, or a central line infection.
3. Acute on Chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3-1.5 but peaked at 2.2 this morning. This could be due to the procedure or pre-renal azotemia. The patient has been bolused"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient is currently being treated with intravenous antibiotics and is clinically improved. However, he still experiences persistently spiking fevers after the removal of the pacer lead. 

Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has endocarditis caused by group B strep bacteria, which has affected his aortic valve homograft. Repeat echocardiogram showed worsening aortic insufficiency. The patient is continuing to receive penicillin, and a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to evaluate for abscess or fistula.
2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing spiking fevers for the last three days, which is concerning for worsening of the disease or a possible complication. Other potential etiologies include pulmonary infection or urinary tract infection.
3. Infected Pacer Leads: The patient had infected pacer leads, which were removed on [date]. A temporary pacer was placed, and the site is being monitored for any signs of infection or bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has been diagnosed with group B Strep endocarditis involving the tricuspid and aortic valve. Despite receiving penicillin therapy and gentamicin course, the patient developed recurrent fever. He underwent pacer lead extraction and repeat TEE showed moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, and circumferential heterogeneously thickened aortic annulus with a small echolucent area adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate vegetation was also found on the tricuspid valve.

The patient is currently on penicillin G IV Q4 for group B Strep endocarditis and his surgical candidacy is being evaluated due to multiple previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve. Surgical intervention is being considered as the only opportunity for cure since the patient is experiencing recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings concerning for aortic root abscess. A repeat TEE is planned on Monday to evaluate the interval progression of aortic root involvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has ongoing endocarditis involving the tricuspid and aortic valve. There is a concern for worsening of valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has group B strep endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient is currently experiencing recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has an ongoing infection of the heart valves caused by group B strep bacteria. This can lead to further damage to the valves, potential embolism, and systemic infection.
2. Infected Pacemaker: The patient's pacemaker is also infected, which may require surgical removal or replacement.
3. Valvular Damage: The recurrent fever suggests worsening of the endocarditis, which can lead to progressive damage to the heart valves.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was elevated and peaked after a procedure, indicating acute renal failure on top of pre-existing chronic renal failure. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure but has been resolved and is now on room air. However, he still requires supplemental oxygen at night for apnea, indicating ongoing respiratory issues.
6. Anemia: The patient has persistent anemia likely due to blood loss and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. He has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient has recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves. This condition can lead to further damage to the valves and potentially spread to other parts of the body.
2. Infected Pacemaker: The patient's pacemaker is infected, which can result in malfunctioning of the device and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Valvular Damage: The patient's recurrent fever indicates worsening of the valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy. If left untreated, this can lead to heart failure and other complications.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level appears to be 1.3-1.5, which has peaked to 2.2 in the setting of a procedure. This suggests acute kidney injury on top of chronic renal failure. Pre-renal azotemia is likely due to the patient being NPO with minimal intake after a procedure.

   tricuspid and aortic valve. Penicillin course started on [**2-7**], received
   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Plan to repeat TEE on Monday to evaluate interval progression of
   aortic root involvement, will repeat sooner if fever curve worsens or
   hemodynamics change
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue
   .

   endocarditis as above. Continued workup to rule out other possible
   etiologies including pulmonary infection, UTI
   - management of endocarditis as outlined above
   - CT Chest with continued LL collapse and effusion, no clear evidence
   of septic emboli

   - Continue penicillin monotherapy for now, no culture based evidence
   for need to broaden therapy
   .
   #. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
 pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission,
   wound cultures grew Group B strep, no evidence of Osteomyelitis at that
   time, additionally pt will require prolonged course of pencillin as
   above for endocarditis
   - will have podiatry re-evaluate given increased likelihood of cardiac
   surgery being necessary
   - continue current local wound care
   .
   #. Infected Pacer Leads - EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - Appreciate EP recs

","Based on the provided progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has involvement of pacemaker leads, tricuspid and aortic valve, and recurrent fever despite maximal medical therapy. This indicates a high risk of worsening valvular damage and potential septic emboli.

2. Aortic Root Abscess: The echocardiographic findings show a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, and aortic annulus circumferentially heterogeneously thickened with a small echolucent area adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Surgical intervention may be necessary to treat this condition.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.3-1.5, which peaked to 2.2 in the setting of sepsis, now worsening. This could be related to gentamicin therapy or other factors. Close monitoring and renal dosing of medications are required.

4. Anemia: The patient has persistently low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin levels. Blood loss and inflammation may be contributing factors. Pantoprazole therapy is being continued, and transfusion may be required for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia.

5. Bilateral Foot Ulcers: Wound cultures grew Group B strep, and there is no evidence"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis involving the aortic valve homograft and infected pacemaker. The patient has recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening valvular damage: The patient's endocarditis is progressing despite maximal medical therapy, which may lead to further deterioration of the aortic valve homograft.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely due to pre-renal azotemia caused by decreased urine output and use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure but has since resolved and is now on room air with occasional need for supplemental oxygen at night.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely caused by blood loss and inflammation. Transfusion may be required to maintain a hematocrit level above 21% or prevent signs of ischemia.
5. Infected pacemaker leads: The patient had infected pacemaker leads, which were removed on [date]. Temporary pacing has been placed, and the site is being monitored for any complications such as oozing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with an aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. He also has CHB s/p PPM and group B Strep endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient was admitted to the ICU with fever, leukocytosis, and signs of septic shock. He underwent removal of the infected pacer leads, temporary pacemaker placement, and received IV antibiotics. The patient's condition improved initially but then developed worsening left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis, increasing moderate partially loculated left pleural effusion, new small right pleural effusion, asymmetric ground glass and septal thickening likely due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema, and enlarging mediastinal lymph nodes. His symptoms include intermittent fevers and coughing with sputum production. The patient has chronic renal failure, anemia, and type II diabetes mellitus. He is currently on various medications including penicillin G potassium, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and insulin glargine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has a history of group B Strep endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. This condition can lead to worsening AI (aortic insufficiency) and the development of abscesses.

The patient has been clinically improved on IV antibiotics but continues to have persistently spiking fevers after pacer lead removal. The physician is considering re-visiting the issue with surgery and plans to repeat TEE on Saturday to evaluate the progression of abscess.

Other concerns include fever/leukocytosis, infected pacer leads, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, anemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the group B strep endocarditis, development of septic emboli, progression of the abscess, exacerbation of the respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, and worsening of the anemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual in the ICU with arterial line stoppage. They have a history of surgery consideration and repeat CT scan showing new clusters of poorly defined subcentimeter right apical lung nodules. The nodules are consistent with either an infectious or inflammatory etiology, although potentially related to septic emboli. There is worsening left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis, increasing moderate partially loculated left pleural effusion, and new small right pleural effusion. Additionally, there is new asymmetric ground glass and septal thickening likely due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Enlarging mediastinal lymph nodes are also present, likely related to CHF or infection. The patient has no known drug allergies and received Penicillin G potassium last on 02/27/2201 at 04:00 AM. They were given Pantoprazole (Protonix) on 02/26/2201 at 10:00 PM and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) on the same day at 10:00 PM. Other medications include changes to medical and family history. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of 02/27/2201 06:04 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings. The patient has a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F),"

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has chronic heart block after pacemaker placement and is currently being treated for group B strep endocarditis involving the pacer leads, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve. The patient has recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy. He also has bilateral foot ulcers with wound cultures growing group B strep, no evidence of osteomyelitis at this time. The patient underwent pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**] and repeat TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, and aortic annulus circumferentially heterogeneously thickened with a small echolucent area adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate vegetation on the tricuspid valve. The patient's renal function is worsening, and he has acute on chronic renal failure. He also has anemia likely due to blood loss and inflammation, and his diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with insulin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with an aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has CHB s/p PPM and is now experiencing group B strep endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient has recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has involvement of pacer leads, tricuspid and aortic valve, and has already undergone penicillin treatment. However, the patient developed recurrent fever, and a repeat TEE demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, and aortic annulus circumferentially heterogeneously thickened with a small echolucent area adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate vegetation on the tricuspid valve. This indicates ongoing infection and potential complications such as valve damage or embolic events.
2. Aortic Root Abscess: The presence of an abscess in the aortic root can lead to further complications such as worsening aortic regurgitation, heart block, or even rupture of the aorta.
3. Heart Block: The patient's heart block is related to damage of the conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries. This can lead to"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with abscess
   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep
   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve now with
   recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite
   maximal medical therapy
   .
   #. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid and aortic valve. Penicillin course started on [**2-7**], received
   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Plan to repeat TEE on Monday to evaluate interval progression of
   aortic root involvement
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue
   .
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for worsening complication of
   endocarditis as above. Continued workup to rule out other possible
   etiologies including pulmonary infection, UTI
   - management of endocarditis as outlined above
   - CT Chest with continued LL collapse and effusion, no clear evidence
   of septic emboli
   - f/u BCx, UCx, sputum cx
 No growth
   - Continue penicillin monotherapy for now, no culture based evidence
   for need to broaden therapy
   .
   #. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
 pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission,
   wound cultures grew Group B strep, no evidence of Osteomyelitis at that
   time, additionally pt will require prolonged course of pencillin as
   above for endocarditis
   - will have podiatry re-evaluate given increased likelihood of cardiac
   surgery being necessary
   - continue current local wound care
   .
   #. Infected Pacer Leads - EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - Appreciate EP recs
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block
 pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart
   block related to damage of conduction system from endocarditis and
   multiple previous surgeries
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic renal failure - baseline Cr 1.3-1.5 peaked to 2.2
   in setting of sepsis, now worsening
   - may be related to gentamicin therapy
 now off
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   .
   #. Anemia
 Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.
   Persistently low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While
   patient was intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing
   from pacer site but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair, CHB s/p PPM, now with group B strep endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. He has recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has ongoing endocarditis with involvement of pacemaker leads, tricuspid and aortic valve. He has developed recurrent fever despite penicillin course and gentamicin therapy. Surgical intervention may be necessary due to the presence of aortic root abscess.
2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient's continued fevers could indicate worsening complications of endocarditis or other possible etiologies such as pulmonary infection or urinary tract infection.
3. Bilateral Foot Ulcers: The patient has foot ulcers with wound cultures growing Group B strep. There is an increased likelihood of osteomyelitis, and the patient may require cardiac surgery.
4. Infected Pacer Leads: The patient had infected pacemaker leads that were removed on [**2201-2-24**]. Temporary pacer placement was done.
5. Complete Heart Block: The patient has heart block related to damage of the conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of valve replacement and has been experiencing low-grade temperatures. They were asked to see a podiatrist due to bilateral soft tissue ulcers on the plantar aspects of their forefeet. There is also questionable lucency and cortical irregularity of the right sesamoid bone adjacent to the ulcer, which could possibly represent osseous infectious involvement.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received Penicillin G potassium in the past. They are currently on prophylactic Heparin Sodium and Pantoprazole (Protonix).

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the foot ulcers. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 99.4°F (37.4°C), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/53 mmHg to 120/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is paced.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,290 mL of total fluids, with 107 mL going into the TF port, 800 mL into the PO port, and 490 mL into the IVF port. The total output is 1,550 mL of blood products and 1,550 mL of urine."

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He also has CHB s/p PPM and now presents with group B strep endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient has recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy. He has been treated with Penicillin G and gentamicin, but continues to have fevers. The patient underwent pacer lead extraction and temporary pacemaker placement. Repeat TEE showed moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve, small vegetation at the aortic root, and aortic annulus circumferentially heterogeneously thickened with a small echolucent area adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate vegetation on the tricuspid valve. The patient is known to be a high-risk surgical candidate due to multiple previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve.

   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve now with
   recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite
   maximal medical therapy
   .
   #. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid and aortic valve. Penicillin course started on [**2-7**], received
   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Plan to repeat TEE on Monday to evaluate interval progression of
   aortic root involvement, consider repeat sooner if pt has persistent
   chest discomfort, fevers
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue

   #. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
 pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission,
   wound cultures grew Group B strep, no evidence of Osteomyelitis at that
   time, additionally pt will require prolonged course of pencillin as

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with abscess
   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep
   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve now with
   recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite
   maximal medical therapy
   .
   #. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid and aortic valve. Penicillin course started on [**2-7**], received
   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Plan to repeat TEE on Monday to evaluate interval progression of
   aortic root involvement, consider repeat sooner if pt has persistent
   chest discomfort, fevers
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue
   .
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for complication of endocarditis as
   above. Continued workup to rule out other possible etiologies including
   pulmonary infection, UTI
   - management of endocarditis as outlined above
   - CT Chest with continued LL collapse and effusion, no clear evidence
   of septic emboli
   - f/u BCx, UCx, sputum cx
 No growth
   - Continue penicillin monotherapy for now, no culture based evidence
   for need to broaden therapy
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia
 K rising to 5.2 in setting of ARF
 he is receiving
   approx 20meq daily of K from Penicillin (1.7meq/1million units)
   - will give 30meq kayexalate now, IVF
   - continue to follow
   .
   #. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
 pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission,
   wound cultures grew Group B strep, no evidence of Osteomyelitis at that
   time, additionally pt will require prolonged course of pencillin as
   above for endocarditis
   - will have podiatry re-evaluate given increased likelihood of cardiac
   surgery being necessary
   - continue current local wound care
   .
   #. Infected Pacer Leads - EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - Appreciate EP recs
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block
 pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart
   block related to damage of conduction system from endocarditis and
   multiple previous surgeries
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic renal failure - baseline Cr 1.3-1.5 peaked to 2.2
   in setting of sepsis, now worsening
   - may be related to gentamicin therapy
 now off
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   .
   #. Anemia
 Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.
   Persistently low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While
   patient was intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing
   from pacer site but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
   - cont RISS  / Glargine
   .
   #.  Access - PICC placed [**2201-2-16**], peripheral IV
   .
   #. PPX - Heparin SC, PPI [**Hospital1 **], bowel regimen
   .
   #. FEN: continue to follow Ca replete PRN, encourage supplemental
   shakes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications and conditions. 

1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has endocarditis caused by Group B Strep bacteria. This infection involves the pacemaker leads, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve. Despite receiving antibiotic therapy, the patient developed recurrent fever, indicating that the infection has not been fully cleared.

2. Aortic Root Abscess: The repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve with severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and a small vegetation at the aortic root. The aortic annulus is circumferentially heterogeneously thickened with a small echolucent area adjacent to the non-coronary cusp, which is concerning for abscess formation.

3. Complete Heart Block: The patient experienced a complete heart block related to damage of the conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries. This resulted in the need for a temporary pacer placement.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.3-1.5, which peaked to 2.2 in the setting of sepsis and are now worsening. This may be related to gentamicin therapy. The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to blood"

   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep
   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve now with
   recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite
   maximal medical therapy.  On [**2-28**] pt with vagal symptoms, low BP and
   decreased responsiveness so patient was intubated.
   .
   #. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid and aortic valve. Penicillin course started on [**2-7**], received
   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.  Patient decompensated on [**2-28**] and
   was intubated.  TEE was done emergently and showed worsening MR/AI.
   Discussed with surgery who may proceed with surgery this week.
   - Need to have formal discussion with surgery today and get patient
   ready for OR ASAP.  Will determine if patient needs tooth extraction,
   cath, etc prior to OR.  Other studies have been done.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Keep patient intubated overnight in preparation for surgery.  Should
   not have difficulty from a respiratory perspective.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair. He has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis involving the pacer leads, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve. Despite maximal medical therapy, the patient has recurrent fever and worsening valvular damage. He was intubated on 02/28 due to vagal symptoms, low blood pressure, and decreased responsiveness. A repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve with severe aortic regurgitation (AR), small vegetation at the aortic root, and aortic annular echolucency concerning for abscess. The patient is a high-risk surgical candidate due to multiple previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve. However, given the recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide the only opportunity for cure. The patient requires a formal discussion with surgery today and preparation for the operating room as soon as possible. Other studies have been done, and the patient will continue on Penicillin G currently at 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR <50, holding on further gentamicin due to worsening renal function and low likelihood of further benefit. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced, and he has a"

   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with abscess
   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep
   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve now with
   recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite
   maximal medical therapy.  On [**2-28**] pt with vagal symptoms, low BP and
   decreased responsiveness so patient was intubated.
   .
   #. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid and aortic valve. Penicillin course started on [**2-7**], received
   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.  Patient decompensated on [**2-28**] and
   was intubated.  TEE was done emergently and showed worsening MR/AI.
   Discussed with surgery who may proceed with surgery this week.
   - Need to have formal discussion with surgery today and get patient
   ready for OR ASAP.  Will determine if patient needs tooth extraction,
   cath, etc prior to OR.  Other studies have been done.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Keep patient intubated overnight in preparation for surgery.  Should
   not have difficulty from a respiratory perspective.
   .
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for complication of endocarditis as
   above. Continued workup to rule out other possible etiologies including
   pulmonary infection, UTI.
   - management of endocarditis as outlined above
   - CT Chest with continued LL collapse and effusion, no clear evidence
   of septic emboli
   - f/u BCx, UCx, sputum cx
 No growth
   - Continue penicillin monotherapy for now, no culture based evidence
   for need to broaden therapy
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia
 K rising to 5.7 in setting of ARF
 he is receiving
   approx 20meq daily of K from Penicillin (1.7meq/1million units)
   - will continue with kayexalate now, IVF.  Only minimal stool output,
   will give glucose/insulin as well.
   - continue to follow
   .
   #. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
 pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission,
   wound cultures grew Group B strep, no evidence of Osteomyelitis at that
   time, additionally pt will require prolonged course of pencillin as
   above for endocarditis
   - will have podiatry re-evaluate given increased likelihood of cardiac
   surgery being necessary
   - continue current local wound care
   .
   #. Infected Pacer Leads - EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - Appreciate EP recs
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block
 pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart
   block related to damage of conduction system from endocarditis and
   multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry.
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic renal failure - baseline Cr 1.3-1.5 peaked to 2.2
   in setting of sepsis, now worsening after events of yesterday.
   - may be related to gentamicin therapy
 now off
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   - Increase HR for forward flow.  Follow UOP.
   .
   #. Anemia
 Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.
   Persistently low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While
   patient was intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing
   from pacer site but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
   - cont RISS  / Glargine
   .
   #.  Access - PICC placed [**2201-2-16**], peripheral IV, Aline in place
   .
   #. PPX - Heparin SC, PPI [**Hospital1 **], bowel regimen
   .
   #. FEN: continue to follow Ca replete PRN, encourage supplemental

   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.  Patient decompensated on [**2-28**] and
   was intubated.  TEE was done emergently and showed worsening MR/AI.
   Discussed with surgery who may proceed with surgery this week.
   - Need to have formal discussion with surgery today and get patient
   ready for OR ASAP.  Will determine if patient needs tooth extraction,
   cath, etc prior to OR.  Other studies have been done.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue

   - Follow blood cultures
   - Keep patient intubated overnight in preparation for surgery.  Should
   not have difficulty from a respiratory perspective.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with an aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. He has also undergone PPM (pacemaker) implantation and is now presenting with group B strep endocarditis involving the pacer leads, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve. The patient developed recurrent fever on 02/22 despite receiving a course of penicillin and gentamicin. On 02/23, the patient underwent pacer lead extraction, but continued fevers prompted an emergent TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) on 02/25, which showed worsening MR/AI (mitral regurgitation and aortic insufficiency). Surgery was consulted, and the patient is being prepared for surgery this week. The patient is known to be a high-risk surgical candidate due to multiple previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve, but given the recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings concerning for an aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide the only opportunity for cure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has involvement of pacer leads, tricuspid and aortic valve, and has not responded to penicillin therapy. There is a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve with (2+)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to mild hypotension and received a 500cc bolus to maintain target mean arterial pressures (MAPs). The patient's pacemaker was changed to 80bpm with improved urine output (UO) and blood pressure, but creatinine levels rose. Hyperkalemia improved with kayexelate, insulin, and glucose. The patient started on levophed for low MAPs and was switched to CPAP. Lasix 50mg was given.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics administered was penicillin G potassium at 05:17 AM on 2201-3-2. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at 0.5 mg/hour, norepinephrine at 0.02 mcg/kg/min, dextrose 50%, insulin, pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and furosemide (Lasix).

   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with abscess
   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep
   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve now with
   recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite
   maximal medical therapy.  On [**2-28**] pt with vagal symptoms, low BP and
   decreased responsiveness so patient was intubated.
   .
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid and aortic valve. Penicillin course started on [**2-7**], received
   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.  Patient decompensated on [**2-28**] and
   was intubated.  TEE was done emergently and showed worsening MR/AI.
   - Need to have formal discussion with surgery today and get patient
   ready for OR ASAP.  Will determine if patient needs tooth extraction,
   cath, etc prior to OR.  Other studies have been done.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue
   - Follow blood cultures
   2. Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for complication of endocarditis as
   above. Continued workup to rule out other possible etiologies including
   pulmonary infection, UTI.
   - management of endocarditis as outlined above
   - CT Chest with continued LL collapse and effusion, no clear evidence
   of septic emboli
   - f/u BCx, UCx, sputum cx
 No growth
   - Continue penicillin monotherapy for now, no culture based evidence
   for need to broaden therapy
   .
   3. Hyperkalemia
 improved with K 3.8 this morning.
   .
   4. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
 pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission,
   wound cultures grew Group B strep, no evidence of Osteomyelitis at that
   time, additionally pt will require prolonged course of pencillin as
   above for endocarditis
   - will have podiatry re-evaluate given increased likelihood of cardiac
   surgery being necessary
   - continue current local wound care
   .
   5. Infected Pacer Leads - EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - Appreciate EP recs
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   .
   6. Complete Heart Block
 pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart
   block related to damage of conduction system from endocarditis and
   multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry.
   .
   7. Acute on Chronic renal failure - baseline Cr 1.3-1.5 peaked to 2.2
   in setting of sepsis, now worsening after events of yesterday.
   - may be related to gentamicin therapy
 now off
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   - Increase HR for forward flow.  Follow UOP.
   .
   8. Anemia
 Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.
   Persistently low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While
   patient was intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing
   from pacer site but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia
   .
   9. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
   - cont RISS  / Glargine

   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep
   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve now with
   recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite
   maximal medical therapy.  On [**2-28**] pt with vagal symptoms, low BP and
   decreased responsiveness so patient was intubated.
   .
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid and aortic valve. Penicillin course started on [**2-7**], received
   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.  Patient decompensated on [**2-28**] and
   was intubated.  TEE was done emergently and showed worsening MR/AI.
   - Need to have formal discussion with surgery today and get patient
   ready for OR ASAP.  Will determine if patient needs tooth extraction,
   cath, etc prior to OR.  Other studies have been done.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue
   - Follow blood cultures
   2. Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for complication of endocarditis as
   above. Continued workup to rule out other possible etiologies including
   pulmonary infection, UTI.
   - management of endocarditis as outlined above
   - CT Chest with continued LL collapse and effusion, no clear evidence
   of septic emboli
   - f/u BCx, UCx, sputum cx
 No growth
   - Continue penicillin monotherapy for now, no culture based evidence
   for need to broaden therapy
   .
   3. Hyperkalemia
 improved with K 3.8 this morning.
   .
   4. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
 pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission,
   wound cultures grew Group B strep, no evidence of Osteomyelitis at that
   time, additionally pt will require prolonged course of pencillin as
   above for endocarditis
   - will have podiatry re-evaluate given increased likelihood of cardiac
   surgery being necessary
   - continue current local wound care
   .
   5. Infected Pacer Leads - EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - Appreciate EP recs
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   .
   6. Complete Heart Block
 pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart
   block related to damage of conduction system from endocarditis and
   multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry.
   .
   7. Acute on Chronic renal failure - baseline Cr 1.3-1.5 peaked to 2.2
   in setting of sepsis, now worsening after events of yesterday.
   - may be related to gentamicin therapy
 now off
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   - Increase HR for forward flow.  Follow UOP.
   .
   8. Anemia
 Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.
   Persistently low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While
   patient was intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing
   from pacer site but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia
   .

 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Keep patient intubated overnight in preparation for surgery.  Should
   not have difficulty from a respiratory perspective.
   .
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for complication of endocarditis as
   above. Continued workup to rule out other possible etiologies including
   pulmonary infection, UTI.
   - management of endocarditis as outlined above
   - CT Chest with continued LL collapse and effusion, no clear evidence
   of septic emboli
   - f/u BCx, UCx, sputum cx
 No growth
   - Continue penicillin monotherapy for now, no culture based evidence
   for need to broaden therapy

   #. Hyperkalemia
 K rising to 5.7 in setting of ARF
 he is receiving
   approx 20meq daily of K from Penicillin (1.7meq/1million units)
   - will continue with kayexalate now, IVF.  Only minimal stool output,
   will give glucose/insulin as well.
   - continue to follow
   .
   #. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
 pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission,
   wound cultures grew Group B strep, no evidence of Osteomyelitis at that
   time, additionally pt will require prolonged course of pencillin as
   above for endocarditis
   - will have podiatry re-evaluate given increased likelihood of cardiac
   surgery being necessary
   - continue current local wound care
   .
   #. Infected Pacer Leads - EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - Appreciate EP recs

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], AVR with abscess repair
   at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis
   complicated by infected pacemaker, infected aortic valve now with
   persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy.
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid valve, and aortic valve and s/p lead extraction on [**2201-2-23**].
   Regarding antibiotic course, patient has received gentamicin ([**Date range (1) 4593**])
   and penicillin ([**2-7**]
 present).  Penicillin course started on [**2-7**],
   received gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).   Repeat echo has demonstrated
   worsened MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] surgery, he has an extremely high risk for operative
   repair/replacement and they will hold off on surgical intervention at
   this time.
   - continue antibiotics with penicillin G
   - appreciate surgery recs, ID, and EP recs
   - follow-up with OFMS regarding teeth extraction
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - consider repeat TEE in a week for further evaluation of valvular
   disease
 TEE currently will likely not change management at this time.
   2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
   Pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission with wound cultures grew
   Group B strep and no evidence of osteomyelitis at that time.
   - continue current local wound care
   3. Infected Pacer Leads
   EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer placed
   - Appreciate EP recs and will follow-up with EP regarding further long
   term plan options whether he does or doesn
t have surgery
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   4. Complete Heart Block
   Pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart block related to damage of
   conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Will follow-up with EP as above
   5. Acute on Chronic renal failure
   Patient has a baseline creatinine 1.3-5 and has worsened to the mid 3s
   over the last 72 hours. Etiology thought likely related to ATN in the
   setting of gentamicin, hypotension, and sepsis.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - avoid further nephrotoxic medications
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.  Persistently
   low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], AVR with abscess repair
   at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis
   complicated by infected pacemaker, infected aortic valve now with
   persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy.
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid valve, and aortic valve and s/p lead extraction on [**2201-2-23**].
   Regarding antibiotic course, patient has received gentamicin ([**Date range (1) 4593**])
   and penicillin ([**2-7**]
 present).  Penicillin course started on [**2-7**],
   received gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).   Repeat echo has demonstrated
   worsened MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] surgery, he has an extremely high risk for operative
   repair/replacement and they will hold off on surgical intervention at
   this time.
   - continue antibiotics with penicillin G
   - appreciate surgery recs, ID, and EP recs
   - follow-up with OFMS regarding teeth extraction
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - consider repeat TEE in a week for further evaluation of valvular
   disease
 TEE currently will likely not change management at this time.
   2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
   Pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission with wound cultures grew
   Group B strep and no evidence of osteomyelitis at that time.
   - continue current local wound care
   3. Infected Pacer Leads
   EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer placed
   - Appreciate EP recs and will follow-up with EP regarding further long
   term plan options whether he does or doesn
t have surgery
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   4. Complete Heart Block
   Pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart block related to damage of
   conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Will follow-up with EP as above
   5. Acute on Chronic renal failure
   Patient has a baseline creatinine 1.3-5 and has worsened to the mid 3s
   over the last 72 hours. Etiology thought likely related to ATN in the
   setting of gentamicin, hypotension, and sepsis.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - avoid further nephrotoxic medications
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.  Persistently
   low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia
   7. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
   Stable

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history including type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, AVR with abscess repair, CHB s/p PPM, and group B Strep endocarditis complicated by infected pacemaker and infected aortic valve. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has involvement of pacemaker leads, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve, and has undergone lead extraction. Antibiotic treatment has been initiated with gentamicin and penicillin. However, a repeat echo has demonstrated worsened mitral regurgitation (MR). Surgery is recommended but carries an extremely high risk, and they will hold off on surgical intervention at this time.

2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers: The patient was evaluated by podiatry upon admission, and wound cultures grew Group B strep with no evidence of osteomyelitis at that time. Current local wound care is being continued.

3. Infected Pacer Leads: The patient's infected pacemaker leads were removed on [**2201-2-24**], and a temporary pacer was placed. The electrophysiology (EP) team's recommendations will be followed up regarding further long-term plan options.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with abscess
   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep
   endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve now with
   recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite
   maximal medical therapy.  On [**2-28**] pt with vagal symptoms, low BP and
   decreased responsiveness so patient was intubated.
   .
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid and aortic valve. Penicillin course started on [**2-7**], received
   gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).  Pt developed recurrent fever on [**2-22**].
   Underwent Pacer lead extraction on [**2-23**]. Given continued fevers repeat
   TEE on [**2-25**] demonstrated a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve
   with (2+) AR, small vegetation at the aortic root, aortic annulus is
   circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area
   adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate
   vegetation on the tricuspid valve.  Patient decompensated on [**2-28**] and
   was intubated.  TEE was done emergently and showed worsening MR/AI.
   - Need to have formal discussion with surgery today and get patient
   ready for OR ASAP.  Will determine if patient needs tooth extraction,
   cath, etc prior to OR.  Other studies have been done.
   - Continuing Penicillin G
 currently 3 million units IV Q4 for GFR
   <50, holding on further gentamicin given worsening of renal function
   and low likelihood of further benefit
   - Pt is known to be high risk surgical candidate due to multiple
   previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve however now that the
   patient is having recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings
   concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide
   only opportunity for cure
   - Greatly appreciate ID, EP and CT surgery involvement in the
   management of this complex issue
   - Follow blood cultures
   2. Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for complication of endocarditis as
   above. Continued workup to rule out other possible etiologies including
   pulmonary infection, UTI.
   - management of endocarditis as outlined above
   - CT Chest with continued LL collapse and effusion, no clear evidence
   of septic emboli
   - f/u BCx, UCx, sputum cx
 No growth
   - Continue penicillin monotherapy for now, no culture based evidence
   for need to broaden therapy
   .
   3. Hyperkalemia
 improved with K 3.8 this morning.
   .
   4. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
 pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission,
   wound cultures grew Group B strep, no evidence of Osteomyelitis at that
   time, additionally pt will require prolonged course of pencillin as
   above for endocarditis
   - will have podiatry re-evaluate given increased likelihood of cardiac
   surgery being necessary
   - continue current local wound care
   .
   5. Infected Pacer Leads - EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer
   placed
   - Appreciate EP recs
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   .
   6. Complete Heart Block
 pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart
   block related to damage of conduction system from endocarditis and
   multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry.
   .
   7. Acute on Chronic renal failure - baseline Cr 1.3-1.5 peaked to 2.2
   in setting of sepsis, now worsening after events of yesterday.
   - may be related to gentamicin therapy
 now off
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   - Increase HR for forward flow.  Follow UOP.
   .
   8. Anemia
 Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.
   Persistently low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While
   patient was intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing
   from pacer site but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair, CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient presented with recurrent fever and concern for progression of valvular damage despite maximal medical therapy. He was intubated due to vagal symptoms, low blood pressure, and decreased responsiveness. A repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve with (2+) aortic regurgitation, small vegetation at the aortic root, and aortic annulus circumferentially heterogenously thickened with a small echolucent area adjacent to the non-coronary cusp concerning for abscess. Moderate vegetation was also found on the tricuspid valve. The patient's condition worsened, leading to worsening mitral regurgitation/acute ischemic heart failure. The patient is at high risk for surgical intervention due to multiple previous surgeries and aortic homograft/valve, but now that the patient is experiencing recurrent fevers and echocardiographic findings concerning for aortic root abscess, surgical intervention may provide the only opportunity for cure.

2. Infected Pacemaker: The patient's infected pacemaker is another complication that requires further evaluation and management.
3. Infected Aortic Valve: The patient's infected aortic valve is a significant concern, especially given the worsening MR seen on repeat echo.
4. Bilateral Foot Ulcers: The patient's bilateral foot ulcers were evaluated on admission, with wound cultures growing Group B strep. These ulcers need continued local wound care to prevent further complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], AVR with abscess repair
   at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis
   complicated by infected pacemaker, infected aortic valve now with
   persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy.
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid valve, and aortic valve and s/p lead extraction on [**2201-2-23**].
   Regarding antibiotic course, patient has received gentamicin ([**Date range (1) 4593**])
   and penicillin ([**2-7**]
 present).  Penicillin course started on [**2-7**],
   received gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).   Repeat echo has demonstrated
   worsened MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] surgery, he has an extremely high risk for operative
   repair/replacement and they will hold off on surgical intervention at
   this time.
   - continue antibiotics with penicillin G
   - appreciate surgery recs, ID, and EP recs
   - follow-up with OFMS regarding teeth extraction
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - repeat TEE today or tomorrow for further evaluation of valvular
   disease
 TEE currently will likely not change management at this time.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3121**] to take to OR today after 5pm for dental extraction; will
   hold SC heparin
   2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
   Pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission with wound cultures grew
   Group B strep and no evidence of osteomyelitis at that time.
   - continue current local wound care
   3. Infected Pacer Leads
   EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer placed
   - Appreciate EP recs and will follow-up with EP regarding further long
   term plan options whether he does or doesn
t have surgery
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   4. Complete Heart Block
   Pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart block related to damage of
   conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Will follow-up with EP as above
   5. Acute on Chronic renal failure
   Patient has a baseline creatinine 1.3-5 and has worsened to the mid 3s
   over the last 72 hours. Etiology thought likely related to ATN in the
   setting of gentamicin, hypotension, and sepsis.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - avoid further nephrotoxic medications
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.  Persistently
   low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site but no hematoma
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia
   7. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
   Stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, AVR with abscess repair, CHB s/p PPM, and now with group B Strep endocarditis complicated by infected pacemaker, infected aortic valve, persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy, and worsened MR. The patient has received gentamicin and penicillin antibiotics. Surgery recommendations are being held off at this time due to high operative risk. The patient has multiple medical complications including bilateral foot ulcers, infected pacer leads, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has involvement of pacer leads, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve, and has undergone lead extraction. Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition remains critical with persistent fever and worsened MR. Surgical intervention may be necessary if the patient's condition does not improve with medical therapy.
2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers: The patient has foot ulcers that were evaluated by podiatry and grew Group B strep. Local wound care is being continued, and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis.
3. Infected Pacer Leads: The patient had temporary pacer placement after removing infected leads. Further long-term plan options will be discussed with the electrophysiologist.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of an unclear nature. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications. These include hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), endocarditis (bacterial infection of the heart), cough, anemia, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cardiac device infection (pacemaker, defibrillator).

24-hour events include blood culturing, increased insulin dosage, administration of penicillin G potassium, and heparin sodium infusion. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are fluctuations in blood pressure and respiratory rate. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has a heart rhythm of ventricular-paced. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1854 mL, including 475 mL of total IV fluids, and an output of 840 mL, including 600 mL of urine output.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, decreased total CO2 levels, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH level of 7.26, which indicates acidosis.

Plan:
The patient is being managed for hyperkalemia, endocarditis, cough, anemia, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cardiac device infection. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, line management (PICC line and arterial line), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], AVR with abscess repair
   at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis
   complicated by infected pacemaker, infected aortic valve now with
   persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy.
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid valve, and aortic valve and s/p lead extraction on [**2201-2-23**].
   Regarding antibiotic course, patient has received gentamicin ([**Date range (1) 4593**])
   and penicillin ([**2-7**]
 present).  Penicillin course started on [**2-7**],
   received gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).   Repeat echo has demonstrated
   worsened MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] surgery, he has an extremely high risk for operative
   repair/replacement and they will hold off on surgical intervention at
   this time.
   - continue antibiotics with penicillin G
   - appreciate surgery recs, ID, and EP recs
   - follow-up with OFMS regarding teeth extraction
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - repeat TEE today or tomorrow for further evaluation of valvular
   disease
 TEE currently will likely not change management at this time.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3121**] to take to OR today after 5pm for dental extraction; will
   hold SC heparin
   2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
   Pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission with wound cultures grew
   Group B strep and no evidence of osteomyelitis at that time.
   - continue current local wound care
   3. Infected Pacer Leads
   EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer placed
   - Appreciate EP recs and will follow-up with EP regarding further long
   term plan options whether he does or doesn
t have surgery
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   4. Complete Heart Block
   Pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart block related to damage of
   conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Will follow-up with EP as above
   5. Acute on Chronic renal failure
   Patient has a baseline creatinine 1.3-5 and has worsened to the mid 3s
   over the last 72 hours. Etiology thought likely related to ATN in the
   setting of gentamicin, hypotension, and sepsis.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - avoid further nephrotoxic medications
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.  Persistently
   low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site but no hematoma

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, AVR with abscess repair, CHB s/p PPM, and group B strep endocarditis complicated by infected pacemaker. He presented with fever, and blood cultures grew group B strep. He has had multiple surgeries, including lead extraction, and has developed complications such as infected pacemaker leads, bilateral foot ulcers, complete heart block, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient underwent dental extraction and arterial line placement. His current medications include penicillin G, pantoprazole, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy, and a repeat echo has demonstrated worsened MR with likely abscess. Surgical intervention is extremely high risk at this time.
2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers: The patient has foot ulcers that grew group B strep but no evidence of osteomyelitis. Local wound care should be continued.
3. Infected Pacer Leads: The patient had infected pacemaker leads removed, and a temporary pacer was placed. Further long-term plan options will be discussed with the electrophysiologist.
4. Complete Heart Block: The patient developed heart block related to damage of the conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries."

   at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis
   complicated by infected pacemaker, infected aortic valve now with
   persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy.
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid valve, and aortic valve and s/p lead extraction on [**2201-2-23**].
   Regarding antibiotic course, patient has received gentamicin ([**Date range (1) 4593**])
   and penicillin ([**2-7**]
 present).  Penicillin course started on [**2-7**],
   received gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).   Repeat echo has demonstrated
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with likely abscess. Per surgery, he has an
   extremely high risk for operative repair/replacement and they will hold
   off on surgical intervention at this time. Spiked low grade fever
   overnight prior to dental extraction and WBC up today.
   - continue antibiotics with penicillin G
   - appreciate surgery recs, ID, and EP recs
   - follow-up with OFMS regarding teeth extraction
   - follow-up daily blood cultures
   - consider repeat TEE today or tomorrow for further evaluation of
   valvular disease for reassurance prior to transfer to floor
   - weekly ESR, CRP per ID for monitoring of infection
   2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
   Pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission with wound cultures grew
   Group B strep and no evidence of osteomyelitis at that time.
   - continue current local wound care
   3. Infected Pacer Leads
   EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer placed
   - Appreciate EP recs and will follow-up with EP regarding further long
   term plan options whether he does or doesn
t have surgery
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   4. Complete Heart Block
   Pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart block related to damage of
   conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Will follow-up with EP as above
   5. Acute on Chronic renal failure
   Patient has a baseline creatinine 1.3-5 and has worsened to the mid 3s
   after hypotensive episode [**2-28**]. Etiology thought likely related to ATN
   in the setting of gentamicin, hypotension, and sepsis. Renal function
   continuing to improve since weekend
   - appreciate renal recs
   - avoid further nephrotoxic medications
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.  Persistently
   low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site but no hematoma. HCT stable>24 hours.
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, AVR with abscess repair, CHB s/p PPM, and group B Strep endocarditis complicated by infected pacemaker. He underwent teeth extraction and has been experiencing persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including group B Strep endocarditis, bilateral foot ulcers, infected pacer leads, complete heart block, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has involvement of pacer leads, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve, and has already undergone lead extraction. Despite receiving antibiotics (gentamicin and penicillin), the patient continues to have persistent fever. There is a repeat echo showing worsened mitral regurgitation (MR) with likely abscess. Surgical intervention is considered high risk at this time, and further evaluation of valvular disease is recommended before transfer to the floor.

2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers: The patient's foot ulcers were evaluated by podiatry and wound cultures grew group B strep. There is no evidence of osteomyelitis at this time. Local wound care should be continued.

3. Infected Pacer Leads: The patient had temporary pacer placement after the removal"

   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid valve, and aortic valve and s/p lead extraction on [**2201-2-23**].
   Regarding antibiotic course, patient has received gentamicin ([**Date range (1) 4593**])
   and penicillin ([**2-7**]
 present).  Penicillin course started on [**2-7**],
   received gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).   Repeat echo has demonstrated
   worsened MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] surgery, he has an extremely high risk for operative
   repair/replacement and they will hold off on surgical intervention at
   this time.
   - continue antibiotics with penicillin G
   - appreciate surgery recs, ID, and EP recs
   - follow-up with OFMS regarding teeth extraction
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - repeat TEE today or tomorrow for further evaluation of valvular
   disease
 TEE currently will likely not change management at this time.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3121**] to take to OR today after 5pm for dental extraction; will
   hold SC heparin

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], AVR with abscess repair
   at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis
   complicated by infected pacemaker, infected aortic valve now with
   persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy.
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid valve, and aortic valve and s/p lead extraction on [**2201-2-23**].
   Regarding antibiotic course, patient has received gentamicin ([**Date range (1) 4593**])
   and penicillin ([**2-7**]
 present).  Penicillin course started on [**2-7**],
   received gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).   Repeat echo has demonstrated
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with likely abscess. Per surgery, he has an
   extremely high risk for operative repair/replacement and they will hold
   off on surgical intervention at this time. Spiked low grade temps
   overnight last 2 nights but hemodynamically stable.
   - continue antibiotics with penicillin G at current dose
   - appreciate surgery recs, ID, and EP recs
   - follow-up with OFMS regarding teeth extraction
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - consider repeat TEE this upcoming week for further evaluation of
   valvular disease and monitoring  progress of infection
   - weekly ESR, CRP per ID for monitoring of infection
   2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
   Pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission with wound cultures grew
   Group B strep and no evidence of osteomyelitis at that time.
   - continue current local wound care
   3. Infected Pacer Leads
   EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer placed
   - Appreciate EP recs and will follow-up with EP regarding further long
   term plan options whether he does or doesn
t have surgery
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   4. Complete Heart Block
   Pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart block related to damage of
   conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Will follow-up with EP as above
   5. Acute on Chronic renal failure
   Patient has a baseline creatinine 1.3-5 and has worsened to the mid 3s
   after hypotensive episode [**2-28**]. Etiology thought likely related to ATN
   in the setting of gentamicin, hypotension, and sepsis. Renal function
   continuing to improve since weekend and stable last 24 hours. Has had
   adequate UOP. Renal has signed off.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - avoid further nephrotoxic medications
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.  Persistently
   low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site but no hematoma. HCT stable>24 hours.
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], AVR with abscess repair
   at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis
   complicated by infected pacemaker, infected aortic valve now with
   persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy.
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid valve, and aortic valve and s/p lead extraction on [**2201-2-23**].
   Regarding antibiotic course, patient has received gentamicin ([**Date range (1) 4593**])
   and penicillin ([**2-7**]
 present).  Penicillin course started on [**2-7**],
   received gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).   Repeat echo has demonstrated
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with likely abscess. Per surgery, he has an
   extremely high risk for operative repair/replacement and they will hold
   off on surgical intervention at this time. Spiked low grade fever
   overnight prior to dental extraction and WBC up today.
   - continue antibiotics with penicillin G
   - appreciate surgery recs, ID, and EP recs
   - follow-up with OFMS regarding teeth extraction
   - follow-up daily blood cultures
   - consider repeat TEE today or tomorrow for further evaluation of
   valvular disease for reassurance prior to transfer to floor
   - weekly ESR, CRP per ID for monitoring of infection
   2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
   Pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission with wound cultures grew
   Group B strep and no evidence of osteomyelitis at that time.
   - continue current local wound care
   3. Infected Pacer Leads
   EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer placed
   - Appreciate EP recs and will follow-up with EP regarding further long
   term plan options whether he does or doesn
t have surgery
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   4. Complete Heart Block
   Pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart block related to damage of
   conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Will follow-up with EP as above
   5. Acute on Chronic renal failure
   Patient has a baseline creatinine 1.3-5 and has worsened to the mid 3s
   after hypotensive episode [**2-28**]. Etiology thought likely related to ATN
   in the setting of gentamicin, hypotension, and sepsis. Renal function
   continuing to improve since weekend
   - appreciate renal recs
   - avoid further nephrotoxic medications
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.  Persistently
   low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site but no hematoma. HCT stable>24 hours.
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic
   root replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], AVR with abscess repair
   at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with group B Strep endocarditis
   complicated by infected pacemaker, infected aortic valve now with
   persistent fever despite maximal medical therapy.
   1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: Pt with involvement of pacer leads,
   tricuspid valve, and aortic valve and s/p lead extraction on [**2201-2-23**].
   Regarding antibiotic course, patient has received gentamicin ([**Date range (1) 4593**])
   and penicillin ([**2-7**]
 present).  Penicillin course started on [**2-7**],
   received gentamicin course ([**Date range (1) 4593**]).   Repeat echo has demonstrated
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with likely abscess. Per surgery, he has an
   extremely high risk for operative repair/replacement and they will hold
   off on surgical intervention at this time. Spiked low grade fever
   overnight prior to dental extraction and WBC up today.
   - continue antibiotics with penicillin G
   - appreciate surgery recs, ID, and EP recs
   - follow-up with OFMS regarding teeth extraction
   - follow-up daily blood cultures
   - consider repeat TEE today or tomorrow for further evaluation of
   valvular disease for reassurance prior to transfer to floor
   - weekly ESR, CRP per ID for monitoring of infection
   2. Bilateral Foot Ulcers
   Pt was evaluated by podiatry on admission with wound cultures grew
   Group B strep and no evidence of osteomyelitis at that time.
   - continue current local wound care
   3. Infected Pacer Leads
   EP removed leads on [**2201-2-24**], temporary pacer placed
   - Appreciate EP recs and will follow-up with EP regarding further long
   term plan options whether he does or doesn
t have surgery
   - Increase HR to 80s to help with forward flow and ideally renal
   perfusion.
   4. Complete Heart Block
   Pt s/p pacer lead explant as above, heart block related to damage of
   conduction system from endocarditis and multiple previous surgeries
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Will follow-up with EP as above
   5. Acute on Chronic renal failure
   Patient has a baseline creatinine 1.3-5 and has worsened to the mid 3s
   after hypotensive episode [**2-28**]. Etiology thought likely related to ATN
   in the setting of gentamicin, hypotension, and sepsis. Renal function
   continuing to improve since weekend
   - appreciate renal recs
   - avoid further nephrotoxic medications
   - continue to monitor, renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Likely blood loss and inflammation as dual contributors.  Persistently
   low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin. While patient was
   intubated had Gastroocult + NGT secretions. Did have oozing from pacer
   site but no hematoma. HCT stable>24 hours.
   - Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H
   - Transfuse PRN for HCT < 21 or signs of ischemia
   7. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
   Stable
