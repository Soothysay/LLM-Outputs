   tachycardia after an episode of dialysis yesterday and labs consistent
   with spotaneous bacterial peritonitis.  She appears quite well despite
   her overall condition.
   #. Sepsis:  The patient is hypotensive, tachycardic with low grade
   temps in the setting of SBP.  Basline SBP 80s, but no history of
   tachycardia.  Given small fluid boluses and 100g albumin with some
   improvement. This is concerning for distributive hypotension from
   infection given evidence of SBP.  The patient's CXR is wnl and she does
   not make urine.  No indication of central infection or need for LP.
   Elevated lactate without acidosis not concerning given lack of renal
   clearance.
   - Small boluses of NS prn

   #. Spotaneous bacterial peritonitis: Elevated PMN on diagnositic
   paracentesis although gram stain negative.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone 1g IV Q24 hours
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg (100g) [**10-5**] give and 1g/kg (66g) on [**10-7**]
   - Hold Vanc for now given renal function
   - Appreciate hepatology input
   #. Ascites/ESLD: The patient's LFTs are within normal limits but she
   has significant ascites on exam.  She was scheduled for a large volume
   paracentesis today of 8-10L.  Given hypotension, she had a therapeutic
   para and about 3L were removed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old lady with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hepatic failure (ESLD) due to polycystic kidney disease. She presents with hypotension and tachycardia after an episode of dialysis yesterday. Her labs show signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and she has an elevated lactate level without acidosis. The patient's physical examination reveals significant ascites, impaired skin integrity, and diarrhea. She is currently receiving treatment for sepsis, SBP, ascites, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her hypotension, tachycardia, and evidence of SBP. It is crucial to monitor her closely for any signs of deterioration and administer appropriate antibiotics.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has an elevated PMN count on diagnostic paracentesis, indicating possible SBP. It is important to continue administering antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, and consider albumin administration as per guidelines.
3. Ascites: The patient has significant ascites, which can lead to complications like respiratory distress and abdominal pain. Regular therapeutic paracentesis may be required to manage the ascites and prevent these complications.
4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's hepatic function may deteriorate further, leading to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old lady with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and ESLD from polycystic kidney disease. She presents with hypotension, tachycardia, and laboratory findings consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Despite her overall condition, the patient appears well. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has an indwelling urinary catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and low-grade fever in the setting of SBP raise concerns for sepsis. Small fluid boluses and albumin have been given with some improvement. This suggests distributive hypotension from infection, given evidence of SBP. The patient's chest X-ray is normal, and she does not make urine, which may indicate a lack of central infection or need for lumbar puncture. Elevated lactate without acidosis is not concerning due to lack of renal clearance.

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has elevated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) on diagnostic paracentesis, although the gram stain is negative. Ceftriaxone has been initiated at 1g IV Q24 hours. Albumin 1.5g/kg (100g) has been given and 1g/kg (66g) on [10-7]. Vancomycin has been"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   A 63 year old lady with a complicated history of ESRD and ESLD from
   polycystic kidney disease.  She presents with hypotension and
   tachycardia after an episode of dialysis yesterday and labs consistent
   with spotaneous bacterial peritonitis.  She appears quite well despite
   her overall condition.
   #. Sepsis:  The patient is hypotensive, tachycardic with low grade
   temps in the setting of SBP.  Basline SBP 80s, but no history of
   tachycardia.  Given small fluid boluses and 100g albumin with some
   improvement. This is concerning for distributive hypotension from
   infection given evidence of SBP.  The patient's CXR is wnl and she does
   not make urine.  No indication of central infection or need for LP.
   Elevated lactate without acidosis not concerning given lack of renal
   clearance.
   - Small boluses of NS prn
   - Fludrocortisone & Midrodrine per home doses
   - Continue Ceftriaxone 1g daily, no additional Vancomycin given lack of
   renal function
   - F/U Blood and peritoneal cultures and narrow appropriately.
   - F/u  C. diff given recent abx
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] with HD
   #. Spotaneous bacterial peritonitis: Elevated PMN on diagnositic
   paracentesis although gram stain negative.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone 1g IV Q24 hours
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg (100g) [**10-5**] give and 1g/kg (66g) on [**10-7**]
   - Hold Vanc for now given renal function
   - Appreciate hepatology input
   #. Anemia: Hct drop from admission, now stable.  No obvious bleeding.
   Likely chronic component
   - Monitor PM hct
   - Active T&S
   #. Ascites/ESLD: The patient's LFTs are within normal limits but she
   has significant ascites on exam.  She was scheduled for a large volume
   paracentesis today of 8-10L.  Given hypotension, she had a therapeutic
   para and about 3L were removed.
   - Repeat therapeutic para if worsening abdominal pain/distention or
   respiratory distress
   - Hep input appreciated
   #. s/p bilateral nephrectomy: Renal is following closely, electrolytes
   within normal limits.
   - Renally dose all meds
   - Nephrocaps
   - Appreciate Renal input
   - HD per renal
   - Renagel
   #. Elevated Troponin: The patient's elevated troponin, but trending
   down without CK or MB elevation, chest pain or EKG changes beyond
   tachycardia and a strain pattern.  Likely from stress and lack of renal
   clearance.
   - Repeat EKG
   #. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal diet with supplements TID

   Remains tachycardic which is of concern. As she otherwise looks well
   and the overall all trend has been for improvement (albeit  slow) would
   continue to hold off on either fluid resuscitation or pressors.
   Fluid resuscitation if BP starts to drop
   On Vanc/CTX and will f/u cultures
   On mitodrine/fludrocortisone
   (2) SBP- CTX, 1 gm/kg dose of albumin tomorrow
   (3) Decompensated cirrhosis: therapeutic para as needed. given ongoing
   hypotension, would avoid large volume paracentesis to prevent fluid
   shifts
   (4) ESRD: No HD today given ongoing hypotension ,  lack of acute
   indicators, renal team following
   (5) abn'l CK enzymes: suspect from demand ischemia, trend cardiac
   enzymes and will obtain f/u ECG
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent on pt: 40 minutes.

   Assessment and Plan:
   A 63 year old lady with a complicated history of ESRD and ESLD from
   polycystic kidney disease.  She presents with hypotension and
   tachycardia after an episode of dialysis yesterday, staph aureus
   peritonitis and bacteremia.  She appears quite well despite her overall
   condition.
   #. Sepsis/hypotension:  The patient is growing staph aureus from her
   peritoneal fluid and has GPC
s in her blood.  Pressures are improved
   and she is stably hypotensive.  Her mental status is clear, suggesting
   she is adequately perfused.  She has a notable murmur on exam, which is
   likely old considering her abnormal echo in [**8-7**].  She remains
   tachycardic likely due to under-resuscitation, but we would prefer not
   to give further fluids as she is anuric.  Her elevated lactate is not
   concerning as it is stable and she has no renal clearance.  Per ID, we
   will leave in her dialysis line at this time and obtain surveillance
   cultures.
   - Albumin for fluid replacement per SBP protocol, small boluses of NS
   prn
   - Start with TTE, but if negative may require TEE given her high-grade
   bacteremia.
   - Fludrocortisone & Midrodrine per home doses
   - Continue Ceftriaxone 1g daily, repeat vancomycin dose as level was 13
   (goal 15-20 w/ high-dose bacteremia).
   - Surveillance blood cultures today and tomorrow.  If possible, should
   get cultures at dialysis through dialysis catheter to assess for other
   potential site.
   - F/U Blood and peritoneal cultures and narrow appropriately. -> likely
   MRSA given hospitalizations and frequent taps.
   #. Bacterial peritonitis: Given she is growing staph aureus, most
   likely not SBP but seeded by pericentesis.  We will treat with abx and
   then repeat a tap early this coming week.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone 1g IV Q24 hours.  Extra vanco dose given today,
   dosing based on levels.
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg (100g) today and 1g/kg (66g) on day 3
   - Appreciate hepatology input
   #. Ascites/ESLD: The patient's LFTs are within normal limits but she
   has significant ascites on exam.  She is supposed to have a large
   volume paracentesis at some point of 8-10L.
   - Therapeutic Paracentesis, lower volume given hypotension (3-5L),
   should be done early this week.
   - Hep input appreciated
   #. s/p bilateral nephrectomy: Renal is following closely, electrolytes
   within normal limits.  Plan to hold off on dialysis for the weekend.
   - Renally dose all meds
   - Nephrocaps
   - Appreciate Renal input
   - HD per renal
   - Renagel
   #. Elevated Troponin: The patient has a stably elevated troponin and
   low CK.  Likely from stress and lack of renal clearance.  No need to
   trend further.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old lady with a complicated medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to polycystic kidney disease. She is currently being treated in the ICU for hypotension and bacteremia.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 89/45 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

The patient has several potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension and bacteremia, indicating a possible sepsis. She has staphylococcus aureus growing from her peritoneal fluid and GPC in her blood. Despite being tachycardic, her mental status remains clear, suggesting adequate perfusion. The elevated lactate level is not concerning due to the lack of renal clearance.
2. Bacterial peritonitis: The patient is growing staph aureus, which suggests bacterial peritonitis. She will be treated with antibiotics and a repeat tap early next week.

   Assessment and Plan:
   A 63 year old lady with a complicated history of ESRD and ESLD from
   polycystic kidney disease.  She presents with hypotension and
   tachycardia after an episode of dialysis yesterday and labs consistent
   with spotaneous bacterial peritonitis.  She appears quite well despite
   her overall condition.
   #. Sepsis:  The patient is hypotensive, tachycardic with low grade
   temps in the setting of SBP.  She does have a history of hypotension in
   the 80s, but no history of tachycardia.  She does not appear to be far
   off of baseline at this time, but did dip into the 60s earlier today.
   This is concerning for distributive hypotension from infection given
   evidence of SBP.  The patient's CXR is wnl and she does not make
   urine.  No indication of central infection or need for LP.  Elevated
   lactate without acidosis not concerning given lack of renal clearance.
   - Albumin for fluid replacement per SBP protocol, small boluses of NS
   prn
   - Fludrocortisone & Midrodrine per home doses
   - Continue Ceftriaxone 1g daily, no additional Vancomycin given lack of
   renal function
   - F/U Blood and peritoneal cultures and narrow appropriately.
   - Send C. diff given recent abx
   #. Spotaneous bacterial peritonitis: As suggested by diagnositic
   paracentesis although gram stain and culture not sent.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone 1g IV Q24 hours
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg (100g) today and 1g/kg (66g) on day 3
   - Hold Vanc for now given renal function
   - Appreciate hepatology input
   - Add on culture/gram stain to initial para
   - Add on serum Albumin
   #. Ascites/ESLD: The patient's LFTs are within normal limits but she
   has significant ascites on exam.  She was scheduled for a large volume
   paracentesis today of 8-10L.  She is currently uncomfortable from an
   abdominal and breathing perspective.
   - Therapeutic Paracentesis, lower volume given hypotension (3-5L)
   - Hep input appreciated
   #. s/p bilateral nephrectomy: Renal is following closely, electrolytes
   within normal limits.
   - Renally dose all meds
   - Nephrocaps
   - Appreciate Renal input
   - HD per renal
   - Renagel
   #. Elevated Troponin: The patient's elevated troponin without CK or MB
   elevation, chest pain or EKG changes beyond tachycardia and a strain
   pattern.  Likely from stress and lack of renal clearance.
   - Follow serial enzymes/EKGs q8 hours x3 for CK bump, otherwise no

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old lady with a complicated history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) from polycystic kidney disease. She presents with hypotension and tachycardia after an episode of dialysis yesterday and labs consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is hypotensive, tachycardic with low-grade temperatures in the setting of SBP. She has a history of hypotension in the 80s but no history of tachycardia. She does not appear to be far off of baseline at this time but did dip into the 60s earlier today. This is concerning for distributive hypotension from infection given evidence of SBP.

2. Spotaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): As suggested by diagnostic paracentesis although gram stain and culture not sent. Continue Ceftriaxone 1g IV Q24 hours, albumin 1.5g/kg (100g) today and 1g/kg (66g) on day 3, hold Vanc for now given renal function, appreciate hepatology input, add on culture/gram stain to initial para, and add on serum albumin.
