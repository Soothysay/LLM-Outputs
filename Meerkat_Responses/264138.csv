   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis in the MICU. She has septic shock with persistently elevated lactate, respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia, bullous abdominal rash, and GPCs growing from the blood. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock/GPC bacteremia/abdominal cellulitis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock and GPC bacteremia. If not properly managed, this condition can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction and sepsis-induced tissue injury.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the respiratory support is not adequately provided, it can lead to worsening respiratory distress, lung injury, and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

3. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is sluggish, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. This can progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if not addressed promptly.

4. Trauma: The patient has a history of recent trauma, and it is important to monitor for any signs of complications related to the injury.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which increases the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome.

6. Anemia: The patient has a history of recent melena and is being transfused with packed red blood cells"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 40 YO F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ?DM, depression who
   presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week
   ago, breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis
   Meets SIRS criteria and now WBC climbing gradually. Evident sepsis with
   hypotension, high cardiac output state, organ failure (renal failure
   and respiratory compromise). Likely group A strep. Strep. Pneumoniae
   also possible. Broadly covered at present, and with help of ID, pending
   speciation and sensitivities. Also E. coli in urine culture but not in
   blood. Meropenem and linezolid per ID. Need to also consider empyema
   and SBT.
   - Meropenem, linezolid (stopped other ABx yesterday: Vanc/
   Levo/flagyl/PO vanc)
   - Maintain perfusion, MAP > 65 with pressors PRN (on norepi and
   vasopressin at the moment), CVP > 12
   # Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax
   Both possibly septic, but risky at present to perform diagnostic taps
   given coagulopathy. Will get another US today and mark spot. Unlikely
   that coags will shift much with vitamin K or FFP.
   - US abdomen to mark spot and follow ascites
   - Monitor intravesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] at present with concern for
   abdominal compartment
   - ARDS ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites
   # Abdominal pain
   Given high lactate, concern for mesenteric ischemia > peritonitis.
   Alternatively intrabdominal abcess versus SBT. Also possible colitis
   with bowel thickening on CT
 unclear significance at present. Lactate
   persists in part, no doubt, due to liver failure, but seems quite high
   for this. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis. Possible
   toxin mediated with GAS.
   - Continue IVIG, D/w ID
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Therapeutic tap when feasible
   - Follow US/CT if change
   - Monitor vesicular pressure
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, hep C, COPD, possible DM, and depression. She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, breast pain, and a rash. She was transferred from another hospital. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely caused by group A strep or Streptococcus pneumoniae. She is being treated with antibiotics, including meropenem and linezolid. She also has ascites, effusion, and emphysema, which are being monitored closely. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she requires ARDSnet ventilation. Her liver function is decreased, and she has pancytopenia. She has positive urinalysis for E.coli, but it is not a blood culture organism. Rib fractures are present, but the etiology is unclear. The patient has a history of hypoglycemia and a possible upper GI bleed in the past. She is also experiencing acute kidney injury and has a bilious OG tube drainage. Coagulopathy is also present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already been diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a concern for possible empyema and hemothorax.
2. Liver failure: The patient's liver synthetic function is decreased, and her INR is elevated. She also has an elevated total bilirubin level.

   This is a 40 YO F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ?DM, depression who
   presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week
   ago, breast pain and a rash.
   # Abdominal pain: DDX: SBP, cholangitis, mesenteric ischemia, colitis,
   gastroenteritis, rash, atypical chest pain, worsening ascities,
   vasculitis, less likely splenomegaly or UTI.  Given patients history of
   N/V/D slightly favor infectious etiology, although concern for SBP is
   high.  Elevated lactate certainly concernign for mesenteric ischemia
   although lactate can be elevated by cirrhosis and may be falsely
   elevated.  Her pain may also be due to her rash (discussed below).
   -F/u final read of CT ab
   -F/u Tx [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   -Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Levo/flagyl/PO vanc for possible bacterial infectious
   etiology and tamiflu and acyclovir for posible viral etiology.
   -No evidence of cholangitis at this time on CT, continue to monitor.
   -D/w hepatology and transplant when and how to attempt para.  Given
   concern for cellulitis and small amount of ascities will be difficult.
   -ROMI
   -F/U urine Cx
   -Consult ID: Abx and anti-virals. Would she be candidate for IVIG
   (toxim mediated disease).
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial in the setting of COPD
   exacerbation, volume overload with anasarca and possible infectious
   process.  B/l infiltrates on CXR, Likely not in florid heart failure,
   PaO2:FiO2 = 110.  Meets definition for ARDS.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   -Rule out influenza - treat until negative given ILI, COPD and ICU.
   -Given BP will hold on diurese, but likely will need to remove volume
   -consider thoracentesis
   -wean vent as tolerated - RISBI in am.
   # SIRS/Sepsis: Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia and
   tachypnea (WBC low, but chronic).  Sources for infection include
   pneumonia, SBP, colitis, less likely meningitis.  Also less likely

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, hep C, COPD, and possible diabetes presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena, breast pain, and a rash. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with septic shock, ARDS, pancytopenia, and an elevated intra-abdominal pressure.

Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be due to several possible causes including SBP, cholangitis, mesenteric ischemia, colitis, gastroenteritis, rash, atypical chest pain, worsening ascites, vasculitis, and less likely splenomegaly or UTI. Given the patient's history of N/V/D and the presence of possible infection, infectious etiology is slightly favored. However, the elevated lactate level raises concern for mesenteric ischemia, although it can also be elevated in cirrhosis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has multifactorial respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, volume overload with anasarca, and possible infectious process. The presence of bilateral infiltrates on CXR suggests pneumonia, and the patient meets the criteria for ARDS.
3. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia and tachypnea. Potential sources of infection include pneumonia, SBP, colitis, and less likely meningitis. The patient is currently being treated as septic shock, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued.
4. Rash: The patient's rash may be due to cellulitis, vasculitis, viral rash, zoster, cutaneous cryoglobulinemia, possible necrotizing fasciitis, or self-inflicted harm. Given the patient's leukopenia and neutropenia, there is a concern for disseminated zoster. The patient has also been tested for cryoglobulins and possible HIV.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is secondary to Hep C and possibly exacerbated by EtOH. The liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR, and the patient's MELD score is 27.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient has stable low counts likely related to hep C. There is concern for DIC or hemolytic anemia given the rise in bilirubin. Trending CBC and monitoring for DIC are recommended.
7. Rib fractures/trauma: The patient has rib fractures with no history of trauma. Concerns include falls or trauma while intoxicated or abuse. Pain control with fentanyl is being provided.
8. DM/Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes is unclear, and there is concern for surreptitious insulin injection. C-peptide levels were high, but HbA1c was 5.
9. History of melena: The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 40 YO F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ?DM, depression who
   presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week
   ago, breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis
   Meets SIRS criteria and now WBC climbing gradually. Evident sepsis with
   hypotension, high cardiac output state, organ failure (renal failure
   and respiratory compromise). Likely group A strep. Strep. Pneumoniae
   also possible. Broadly covered at present, and with help of ID, pending
   speciation and sensitivities. Also E. coli in urine culture but not in
   blood. Meropenem and linezolid per ID. Need to also consider empyema
   and SBT.
   - Meropenem, linezolid (stopped other ABx yesterday: Vanc/
   Levo/flagyl/PO vanc)
   - Maintain perfusion, MAP > 65 with pressors PRN (on norepi and
   vasopressin at the moment), CVP > 12
   # Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax
   Both possibly septic, but risky at present to perform diagnostic taps
   given coagulopathy. Will get another US today and mark spot. Unlikely
   that coags will shift much with vitamin K or FFP.
   - US abdomen to mark spot and follow ascites
   - Monitor intravesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] at present with concern for
   abdominal compartment
   - ARDS ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites
   # Abdominal pain
   Given high lactate, concern for mesenteric ischemia > peritonitis.
   Alternatively intrabdominal abcess versus SBT. Also possible colitis
   with bowel thickening on CT
 unclear significance at present. Lactate
   persists in part, no doubt, due to liver failure, but seems quite high
   for this. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis. Possible
   toxin mediated with GAS.
   - Continue IVIG, D/w ID
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Therapeutic tap when feasible
   - Follow US/CT if change
   - Monitor vesicular pressure
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, hep C, COPD, and possible depression. She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various interventions and tests. The key medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis and is showing signs of infection with a high cardiac output state and organ failure. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further identification and sensitivities are pending. Strep pneumoniae and E. coli are possible pathogens.

2. Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax: The patient may have ascites and effusion, which could be septic. It is risky to perform diagnostic taps due to coagulopathy. Another ultrasound will be done to mark the spot for ascites, and intravesicular pressure will be monitored.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient's high lactate levels raise concerns for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis, intrabdominal abscess, or colitis. RUQ US shows ascites and cirrhosis without venous thrombosis. Toxin-mediated pathology with GAS is also a possibility.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is contributing to respiratory failure, likely due to infection and large empyema versus effusion. ARDSnet ventilation has been initiated, and the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis in the MICU experiencing septic shock with persistently elevated lactate, respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia, and a bullous abdominal rash. She also has gram-positive cocci (GPCs) growing from the blood and E. coli in her urine.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock/GPC bacteremia/E. coli in urine/abdominal cellulitis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. The presence of GPCs in the blood and E. coli in the urine indicates a bacterial infection that needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume strategy to minimize lung injury. Decreasing the tidal volume to 30 and closely monitoring the patient's respiratory status is essential to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications.

3. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is sluggish but adequate. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI) and potential renal failure.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has Child's C cirrhosis, which is characterized by liver dysfunction. Rising bilirubin and INR levels suggest worsening liver function and may contribute to the inability to clear lactate. Monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS although mechanism and pathology likely related
   with underlying pneumonia/infection. Concern for empyema, less likely
   hemothorax although under consideration given coagulopathy.
   - Continue ARDS low tidal volume and low rate ventilation given fairly
   large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal volume and rate; increased
   FiO2
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. The patient's condition is complicated by abdominal pain, ascites, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, rash, cirrhosis, positive urinalysis, pancytopenia, rib fractures, hypoglycemia, critical fall history, acute kidney injury, bilious OG tube drainage, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. This condition requires immediate treatment with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.

2. Abdominal Pain/Ascites: The patient has stable ascites with ongoing abdominal pain. Mesenteric ischemia and peritonitis are possible causes, but the lack of intrabdominal abscess on CT makes them less likely. Continued monitoring and consideration of diagnostic paracentesis if there is a change in clinical status are recommended.

3. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient meets criteria for ARDS, likely related to underlying pneumonia/infection. Empyema is also a concern. Low tidal volume and low rate ventilation, along with FiO2 adjustments, are"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis
   Meets SIRS criteria and now WBC gradually downtrending. Evident sepsis
   with hypotension, high cardiac output state, organ failure (renal
   failure and respiratory compromise). Likely [**1-24**] strep. pneumoniae from
   culture data. Broadly covered at present, and with help of ID, pending
   speciation and sensitivities. Also E. coli in urine culture but not in
   blood. Meropenem and linezolid per ID. Need to also consider empyema
   and SBT.
   - Meropenem, stopped linezolid (stopped other ABx yesterday: Vanc/
   Levo/flagyl/PO vanc)
   - Maintain perfusion, MAP > 65 with pressors PRN (on norepi and
   vasopressin at the moment), CVP > 12
   # Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax
   Both possibly septic, but risky at present to perform diagnostic taps
   given coagulopathy. Will get another US today and mark spot. Unlikely
   that coags will shift much with vitamin K or FFP.
   - US abdomen to mark spot and follow ascites
   - Monitor intravesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] at present with concern for
   abdominal compartment
   - ARDS ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down
   tidal volume and rate; increased FiO2
   # Abdominal pain
   Given high lactate, concern for mesenteric ischemia > peritonitis.
   Alternatively intrabdominal abcess versus SBT. Also possible colitis
   with bowel thickening on CT
 unclear significance at present. Lactate
   persists in part, no doubt, due to liver failure, but seems quite high
   for this. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis. Possible
   toxin mediated with GAS.
   - Continue IVIG, D/w ID
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Therapeutic tap when feasible
   - Follow US/CT if change
   - Monitor vesicular pressure
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, hepatitis C, COPD, and possible diabetes, presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has broken ribs and is currently in the ICU. The patient has sepsis with hypotension, high cardiac output state, and organ failure (renal failure and respiratory compromise). She has an infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem and linezolid, and is also being treated for possible empyema and hemothorax. 

Her abdominal pain could be due to mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis, intrabdominal abscess, or colitis. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and she is being ventilated with an ARDSnet protocol. 

The patient has a rash that is vesicular with polymorphonuclear leukocytes, possibly sterile bacterial or viral (varicella-zoster virus). She also has cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C and possibly exacerbated by alcohol use. 

The patient has pancytopenia, which is likely related to hepatitis C. There is uncertainty regarding the etiology of her rib fractures and trauma history. The patient may have had episodes of hypoglycemia and possibly insulinoma. 

She has a history of a critical fall and an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has acute kidney injury, likely due to hypoperfusion"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Given good CO and SVV will hold off
   on fluids for now.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and possible depression. She presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, a rash, and broken ribs approximately one week ago. She is currently in the ICU due to sepsis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia, respiratory failure, and pleural effusion. Her liver function is compromised, and she has pancytopenia. The patient also has rib fractures, hypoglycemia, a history of an upper GI bleed, acute kidney injury, and a bilious OG tube drainage. She is being treated with various medications and has multiple lines and tubes in place. Her condition remains unstable, and she is on pressors and vasopressin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. This is indicated by her hypotension, organ failure (renal and respiratory), and positive blood cultures for strep pneumo.
2. Abdominal Pain/Ascites: The patient has stable abdominal pain and ascites. There is concern for mesenteric ischemia or peritonitis, but lactate levels are resolving. A diagnostic paracentesis was deferred due to coagulopathy.
3. Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion: The patient meets criteria for ARDS (acute respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS although mechanism and pathology likely related
   with underlying pneumonia/infection. Concern for empyema, less likely
   hemothorax although under consideration given coagulopathy.
   - Continue ARDS low tidal volume and low rate ventilation given fairly
   large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal volume and rate; increased
   FiO2
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible breast pain, and a rash. She has been diagnosed with sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, and pancytopenia. She also has a positive urine analysis for E. coli, which is not a blood culture organism. The patient's liver synthetic function is decreased, and she has elevated total bilirubin levels. She has a history of possible neck trauma and rib fractures. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and there is a suspicion of an insulinoma. She has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's kidney function is impaired, and she has been experiencing bilious OG tube drainage without clear obstruction on CT. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, likely secondary to liver failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. It is crucial to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS or a large empyema. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Consideration for thoracentesis should be made when feasible.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient"

   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Given good CO and SVV will hold off
   on fluids for now.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting complaint and not really adequately addressed by primary
   issue at present. Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis
   initially, although lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation
   may also have been secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely
   that levels would have peaked so high solely due to this). Need to
   remain sensitive to possibility of abscess also. SBT possible given
   ascites, although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed
   colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and
   cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin
   mediated at this time.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Lost A-line so no vigileo. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 only boluses as indicated by UOP
   and pressure at present
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today and trial O2 of 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Appears slightly more jaundiced today. Secondary to Hep C, possible
   also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver synthetic function is
   decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score of C. MELD
   27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   ---------
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite
   likely will develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures.
   UOP slightly improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved to 131 now that meds in NS where possible instead of D5. Liver
   failure also likely responsible.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes mellitus. She presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. The patient also has broken ribs and is currently experiencing respiratory failure and sepsis. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate several abnormalities, including an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The blood culture shows the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is consistent with all cultures. 

The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to bilateral infiltrates and a decreased P/F ratio. She also has a pleural effusion, which is likely related to the underlying pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status is being managed with low tidal volume ventilation and increased FiO2.

The patient has a positive urine analysis for E. coli, which is not a blood culture organism. This infection is being covered by meropenem.

The patient's pancytopenia is likely related to her hep C infection. She has been tested for HIV multiple times, but no documented result is available. It is recommended to retest the patient for HIV with her consent.

The patient's rib fractures have an unclear etiology. She has ecchymoses on examination and possible neck trauma. Trauma was consulted in the emergency department, but no further action has been taken at this time"

   - Dermatology recommended to continue to follow viral/fluid cultures,
   to leave overlying skin intact if bullae rupture, and to continue to
   dress with gauze and with daily dressing changes.
   - ID recommended continuing meropenem and acyclovir as unclear whether
   rash is Zoster and would continue coverage. They recommend tapping when
   able.
   - Hepatology recommended continued supportive care, meropenem and
   acyclovir. They noted ascitic tap not required as empiric treatment
   with meropenem.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting complaint and not really adequately addressed by primary
   issue at present. Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis
   initially, although lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation
   may also have been secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely
   that levels would have peaked so high solely due to this). Need to
   remain sensitive to possibility of abscess also. SBT possible given
   ascites, although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed
   colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and
   cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin
   mediated at this time.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Lost A-line so no vigileo. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes who presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has been diagnosed with sepsis and respiratory failure, and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has multiple comorbidities including hepatitis C, depression, and a history of broken ribs. The patient's liver synthetic function is decreased, and she has elevated bilirubin levels. She is also experiencing pancytopenia, hyponatremia, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires ongoing intensive care management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It is crucial to continue aggressive management with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of gas exchange, oxygenation, and ventilation parameters is essential. Adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary to optimize lung function and prevent further complications.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels and decreased liver synthetic function suggest worsening liver failure. Monitoring liver enzymes, coagulation profile, and hepatic encephalopathy is crucial. Administration of lactulose and management of electrolyte imbalances related to liver failure should be considered.
4. Pancytopenia: The"

   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
    - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
    Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
    - Discontinue IVIG
    - Continue antibiotics as above
    - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
    # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
    Meets criteria for ARDS although mechanism and pathology likely
   related with underlying pneumonia/infection. Concern for empyema, less
   likely hemothorax although under consideration given coagulopathy.
    - Continue ARDS low tidal volume and low rate ventilation given fairly
   large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal volume and rate; increased
   FiO2
    # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
    -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
    -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   No fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, hepatitis C, COPD, possible diabetes, depression, and broken ribs. She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. The patient is currently in the ICU due to sepsis/streptococcal pneumonia bacteremia, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, abdominal pain/ascites, and other medical conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis/streptococcal pneumonia bacteremia: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to further organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she meets the criteria for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). This condition requires careful management with low tidal volume ventilation and may progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a large empyema, which can complicate her respiratory status and increase the risk of pneumonia or other infections.

4. Abdominal pain/ascites: The patient has stable ascites, but there is concern for mesenteric ischemia or peritonitis. Monitoring for signs of worsening abdominal pain or signs of infection is essential.

5. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood counts are likely related to her hep C infection. Monitoring for bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting complaint and not really adequately addressed by primary
   issue at present. Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis
   initially, although lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation
   may also have been secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely
   that levels would have peaked so high solely due to this). Need to
   remain sensitive to possibility of abscess also. SBT possible given
   ascites, although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed
   colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and
   cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin
   mediated at this time.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Lost A-line so no vigileo. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 only boluses as indicated by UOP
   and pressure at present
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today and trial O2 of 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Appears slightly more jaundiced today. Secondary to Hep C, possible
   also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver synthetic function is
   decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score of C. MELD
   27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bloody OG tube drainage
   Some bloody tube feed evacuated this a.m. Resolved spontaneous late in
   a.m. Likely related to thrombocytopenia.
   - Continue tube feeds with brief gentle intermittent suction to
   evaluate for further bleeding.
   # Coagulopathy
 Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far. Thrombocytopenia
 partly of liver failure,
   but more likely related to other cell lines being depressed. Should
   test for HIV when possible.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved to 131 now that meds in NS where possible instead of D5. Liver
   failure also likely responsible

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes mellitus. She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash, and has been experiencing respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia: The patient has Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia, which is consistent with all cultures. The recommended treatment includes continuing meropenem, following ID recommendations, and maintaining MAP > 65 with pressors as needed.

2. Abdominal pain/Ascites: The patient has abdominal pain and ascites, possibly related to mesenteric ischemia or peritonitis. Further evaluation, such as a SBT or CT scan, may be necessary. The patient should continue with the current antibiotic regimen and monitor for any changes in clinical status.

3. Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion: The patient meets criteria for ARDS and likely has an empyema. The recommended treatment includes continuing ARDSnet protocol ventilation, closely monitoring pressure, I&Os, and UOP, and considering thoracentesis if coagulopathy improves.

4. Rash: The patient has a vesicular rash with PMNs only so far, and DFA negative. It is advised to continue following cultures and re-culture the rash.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Repeat Blood Cultures today.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting symptom. No clear etiology to explain at this time. Treating
   for SBT. CT showed colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US
   ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider CT abdomen if scan chest.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepetology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, reassess hypoxia with volume down.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02 to 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.
   # Coagulopathy
 Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far. Thrombocytopenia
 partly of liver failure,
   but more likely related to other cell lines being depressed. Should
   test for HIV when possible.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Patient on Vasopressin. Improved to 132 now that meds in NS where
   possible instead of D5. Liver failure also likely responsible.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, possible diabetes, and depression. She presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, a rash, and broken ribs. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure and sepsis, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has several medical complications, including pancytopenia, coagulopathy, positive urine analysis, rib fractures, opioid dependence, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia: The patient has Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia, which is consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood cultures are needed, and meropenem should be continued.
2. Abdominal Pain/Ascites: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to ascites, as indicated by the CT scan showing colitis and the RUQ US revealing ascites. Further investigations, such as a CT abdomen, may be necessary. Monitoring of vesicular pressure is also recommended.
3. Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion: The patient meets criteria for ARDS with decreased P:F ratio and bilateral infiltrates. There is concern for empyema, but hemothorax is less likely. Following pressure, I&Os, and UOP is crucial to estimate fluid needs.
4. Rash: The patient has a vesicular rash with PMNs"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis who is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit). She is experiencing septic shock with persistently elevated lactate, respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia, a bullous abdominal rash, and gram-positive cocci (GPCs) growing from the blood.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Septic Shock/S. pneumo bacteremia: The patient is already being treated with linezolid, but the infection may progress or lead to further complications.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and PEEP of 15. There is a concern about under-PEEPing her, so recruitment maneuvers will be attempted to improve oxygenation.

3. Oliguria: The patient is experiencing decreased urine output, and her creatinine levels are slowly trending up. She is significantly volume overloaded, and diuresis will be attempted to manage this issue.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has worsening liver function indicated by rising bilirubin levels and elevated lactate, suggesting ongoing hepatic dysfunction.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include impaired skin integrity, pain control, altered mental status, altered nutrition, ascites, electrolyte & fluid disorder, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cirrhosis of the liver, coag"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Repeat Blood Cultures today.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting symptom. No clear etiology to explain at this time. Treating
   for SBT. CT showed colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US
   ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider CT abdomen if scan chest.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepetology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, reassess hypoxia with volume down.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02 to 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes, who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, breast pain, and a rash. She has respiratory failure and sepsis as primary issues at present. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis/streptococcus pneumonia bacteremia, abdominal pain with ascites, respiratory failure with pleural effusion, rash with vesicles, cirrhosis, positive urinalysis, pancytopenia, rib fractures/trauma, opioid dependence, diabetes/hypoglycemia, critical fall, history of GI bleed, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, and hyponatremia. She is currently intubated and sedated, with decreased lung sounds on the right side and occasional wheezing on the left side. She also has anasarca, sclera mildly icteric, and an enlarged bullae. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 117/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/streptococcus pneumonia bacteremia: The patient is already being treated for sepsis with antibiotics.
2. Abdominal pain with ascites: The cause of the ascites is unclear at this"

   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD.
   - Would consider broadening coverage to include Vancomycin.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Trending up since admission. Overnight LFTs increased drastically.
   Unclear etiology. Most likely related to cholestasis in the setting of
   acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - CT Abdomen with Contrast today.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepatology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02
   # Blood Per OG Tube: [**Month (only) 11**] be related to gastritis, stress ulcer, varix
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). Question need for EGD to
   eval etiology of bleed.
   - Appreciate Hepatology Recs.
   - Q6 Hr HCT
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   - Platelets >20, FFP to decrease INR
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative. Viral Culture
   preliminary negative.
   - DC Acyclovir
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and possibly diabetes, presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena, breast pain, and a rash. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She also has sepsis and bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Her liver function tests are abnormal, indicating transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia. She has a pleural effusion and is at risk for ARDS. She has coagulopathy with a significantly elevated INR and has experienced a gastrointestinal bleed. She has a vesicular rash but no confirmed viral etiology. She has pancytopenia and positive urinalysis for E. coli. She has rib fractures and signs of trauma, opioid dependence, and possible diabetes with hypoglycemic events. She is also experiencing acute kidney injury and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and adjustment of ventilation settings are necessary.
2. Sepsis and Bacteremia: The patient has sepsis and bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the need for additional coverage should be evaluated based on culture results.
3. Liver Decompensation: The patient's liver synthetic function is decreased"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of Child's C cirrhosis in the MICU. She is experiencing septic shock with persistently elevated lactate, respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia, and a bullous abdominal rash. The patient has not made much clinical progress and remains hypoxemic and pressor-dependent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/S. pneumo bacteremia: The patient is currently being treated for septic shock caused by Staphylococcus pneumonia bacteremia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains hypoxemic and requires respiratory support. A torso CT scan is planned to further evaluate her condition.
3. Oliguria: The patient has low urine output, which may be related to her circulatory issues. Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 70 is aimed to improve urine output.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are rising, indicating possible complications related to her cirrhosis.
5. GI Bleed: There is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the rising Hct levels and NG tube output. Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin concentration and NG tube output is important. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is being used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity,"

   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Bicarb/Mucomyst prior to CT with contrast.
   # Hyponatremia
   Patient on Vasopressin. Improved to 133 now that meds in NS where
   possible instead of D5. Liver failure also likely responsible.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 133/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. Her general appearance is intubated and sedated. She has sclera icteric, dried blood on her lips, and an open gastric tube with blood. Her neck is supple with no jugular venous distention (JVD) or lymphadenopathy (LAD). Her lungs show decreased breath sounds on the right side and rhochi and occasional wheezing on the left side. Her cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Her abdomen is distended and moderately tense with diminished bowel sounds. She has a Foley catheter in place. Her extremities show anasarca and chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally. Her neurologic examination is as follows: sedated and minimally responsive, pupils reactive, unable to evaluate further.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 4."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis in the MICU, experiencing septic shock with persistently elevated lactate, respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia, a bullous abdominal rash, and budding yeast from blood cultures. The patient has not shown significant clinical progress in terms of respiratory function but is now off of pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Sepsis/S. pneumoniae bacteremia/fungemia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin, [Last Name (un)], and metronidazole for sepsis caused by S. pneumoniae bacteremia and fungemia. If the infection does not improve or if there is a resistant strain, alternative antibiotics may need to be considered.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains hypoxemic despite being off pressors. This could indicate ongoing respiratory failure or inadequate oxygenation. Further evaluation and management, such as adjusting ventilator settings or considering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may be necessary.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending down, indicating improvement in renal function. However, close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has Child's C cirrhosis, which is associated with an increased risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepat"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Will pull central line
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] goal -1L
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 30, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy. Given fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or
   other causes.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Follow up methadone clinic
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG tube in;
   currently NPO as holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Discuss on rounds re: pull line
   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Continue Lasix gtt goal -1L
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 50, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Follow up methadone clinic
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, OG tube in; currently NPO as
   holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and possible depression. She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena, breast pain, and a rash. The patient is currently in respiratory failure and sepsis. She has multiple medical complications including sepsis, fungemia, transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory failure/pleural effusion, blood per OG tube, altered mental status, cirrhosis, positive UA, pancytopenia, rib fractures/trauma, opioid dependence, DM/hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, and others. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications and treatments. The patient's condition is unstable, and she is pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae, indicating a bacterial infection. This can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition.
2. Fungemia: The patient has yeast in her blood cultures, suggesting a fungal infection. This can cause systemic illness and potentially organ damage.
3. Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. This could indicate liver dysfunction or damage, which may worsen due to ongoing illness.
4. Respiratory Failure/Pleural"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Discuss on rounds re: pull line
   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Continue Lasix gtt goal -1L
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 50, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Follow up methadone clinic
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, OG tube in; currently NPO as
   holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, hep C, COPD, possible diabetes, and depression. She presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena, breast pain, and a rash. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and sepsis. She has multiple medical complications including sepsis/strep pneumo bacteremia, fungemia, transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory failure/pleural effusion, blood per OG tube, abdominal rash, altered mental status, cirrhosis, positive UA, pancytopenia, rib fractures/trauma, opioid dependence, DM/hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis/strep pneumo bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with Strep. Pneumo bacteria in her blood, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. Fungemia: The patient has yeast present in her blood cultures, indicating a fungal infection. This requires identification and treatment of the specific fungus causing the infection.
3. Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, suggesting liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and further deterioration of liver function.
4. Respiratory failure/pleural eff"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently intubated and sedated, with decreased lung sounds on the right side and occasional wheezing on the left. The patient has a history of cirrhosis with splenomegaly and varices, as well as evidence of portal hypertension. They also have ascites and evidence of liver dysfunction. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and pancreatitis. There are concerns regarding potential bloodstream infections, including a positive blood culture for budding yeast. The patient has a history of chronic venous stasis changes and bullae formation. They are also experiencing renal dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of multifocal pneumonia on imaging studies, which could worsen if not appropriately treated.
2. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhotic liver with portal hypertension and signs of liver dysfunction may lead to further decompensation and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Sepsis: The positive blood culture for budding yeast suggests a bloodstream infection, which could progress to sepsis if not managed promptly.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has chronic venous stasis changes, increasing the risk of developing DVT.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to their underlying lung conditions and current mechanical ventilation.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's renal function is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis admitted to the MICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and severe hypoxemia. She has an abdominal rash with bullae and growth of Gram-positive cocci from the blood. Despite improvement in hemodynamics, the patient continues to have severe hypoxemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple medications including vanc, metronidazole, and micafungin. Her renal function is impaired, and she has elevated liver enzymes. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/S. pneumo bacteremia/fungemia: The patient is already being treated for sepsis caused by suspected Staphylococcus pneumoniae bacteremia and fungemia. It is crucial to continue aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and antifungal agents.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Efforts should be made to wean FiO2 and consider extubation once the patient's condition stabilizes.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as fluid repletion and medication adjustment, should be considered.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which can contribute to her overall morbidity and mortality risk. Monitoring of liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode this AM with approximately 500cc BRBPR. Likely related with
   coagulopathy with component of variceal bleed.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - GI/hepatology consult
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] consider drip
   - Octreotide consider drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider lasix when BPs stable
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy. Given fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or
   other causes. Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG tube in;
   currently NPO as holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy
   # Access:
   - Double Lumen midline placed [**1-18**]; will need to be removed [**1-21**]
   - Arterial Line placed [**1-12**]; will need to remove given fungemia
   - 20 Gauge placed [**1-13**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion: The patient is experiencing episodes of desaturation and has a history of respiratory failure. The presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of a pulmonary infection or pneumonia, which could lead to worsening respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae, indicating bacteremia. This could lead to sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection.

3. Fungemia: The patient's blood cultures have grown yeast, suggesting fungemia. This is a serious infection and requires appropriate antifungal treatment.

4. Abdominal Rash: The patient has an abdominal rash that is improving with therapy. It is important to continue monitoring the rash and following dermatology recommendations.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is unresponsive to voice but shows withdrawal to pain. This altered mental status could be due to various causes, including sedation, hepatic encephalopathy, or cryptococcal meningitis.

6. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis secondary to Hepatitis C and possible alcohol abuse. Decompensation of the liver is expected with elevated INR and T-bili levels.

7. Pancytopenia: The patient has stable"

   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] goal -1L
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 30, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy. Given fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or
   other causes. Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG tube in;
   currently NPO as holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and sepsis. She has multiple medical complications including fungemia, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, altered mental status, and pancytopenia. The patient's condition is improving but she still requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae in her blood, which is causing sepsis. She is receiving appropriate antibiotics and will need to continue treatment until the infection is resolved.
2. Fungemia: The patient's blood cultures have tested positive for yeast, indicating a fungal infection. Further identification of the specific type of fungus is pending, and she is being treated with Micafungin until the speciation is confirmed.
3. Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to a pleural effusion. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been placed on ARDSnet protocol ventilation. The effusion may be secondary to pneumonia or infection.
4. Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient is showing signs of liver dysfunction, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. This may be related"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of Child's C cirrhosis, currently in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). She presents with septic shock, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia and fungemia, and is being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole. She also has ongoing biliary pneumonia and requires high levels of FiO2. The patient's condition is complicated by acute renal failure, elevated bilirubin levels, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/S. Pneumonia Bacteremia/Fungemia: The patient is experiencing persistent fevers and bacteremia/fungemia despite antibiotic treatment. Close monitoring and reevaluation of the antibiotic regimen are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and she requires high FiO2. Active reduction in settings is not currently possible due to ongoing issues. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.
3. GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has experienced a GI bleed, resulting in blood loss anemia. Blood product transfusion and volume resuscitation are required to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal parameters and timely intervention to prevent further deterioration"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of Child's C cirrhosis who is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit). She is experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Septic Shock/S. Pneumonia Bacteremia/Fungemia: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock caused by Staphylococcus pneumonia bacteremia and fungemia. She is being treated with antibiotics and antifungal medication. Blood cultures are to be rechecked.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ongoing bilateral pneumonia and bibasilar collapse, leading to respiratory failure. She is on high FiO2 and there are no active reductions in settings due to ongoing issues.

3. GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has experienced a gastrointestinal bleed resulting in blood loss anemia. She has received packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and intravenous fluids (IVF) to manage the condition. Hepatology is aware of her situation.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, as evidenced by elevated bilirubin levels.

6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose has been restarted to manage this condition.

   today to do an EGD where they found bleeding esophageal and gastric
   varices.  Esophageal varices were banded and gastric varix treated with
   glue with at least temporary hemostasis.  Her blood pressure has
   remained stable though her HR has been 100-120.  We have transfused
   pRBCs, FFP, platelets.  New RIJ central placed this evening.
   Meanwhile, her O2 requirement has increased to 1.0, PEEP 18 as she has
   been transfused additional blood products.
   We had a family meeting today with the patient
s sister and
   brother-in-law, who are her closest family memebers.  Discussed with
   her that she now has multiorgan failure superimposed on her worsening

   point, particularly if she rebleeds.  Her code status was changed to
   DNR/DNI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of Child's C cirrhosis admitted to the MICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She has bullous abdominal rash and growths from the blood. Her condition has improved hemodynamically but she continues to have severe hypoxemia and blood in her stool.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/S. pneumonia bacteremia/fungemia: The patient is being treated with antibiotics and antifungals for septic shock. Blood cultures should be rechecked.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has ongoing bilateral pneumonia and bibasilar collapse. She is on a high FiO2 and there are no active reductions in settings due to ongoing issues.
3. GI bleed/Blood loss anemia: The patient has received packed red blood cells and intravenous fluids. FFP and platelets should be corrected. Hepatology is aware.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is down again today.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient's total bilirubin level is now 26 and climbing.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's head CT scan was unrevealing and could be hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose will be restarted when able.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has acute and chronic pain, altered nutrition, and altered mental status.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has a bleeding esophageal and gastric varix. Esophageal varices were banded and gastric varix treated with glue with temporary hemostasis.
9. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS): The patient has a rash and other signs consistent with TSS.
10. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has severe hypoxemia and ARDS.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information or tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, depression who presents with
   abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain and a rash,
   broken ribs. Respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure and
   altered mental status primary issues at present.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode yesterday with approximately 2.5L blood per rectum total. S/p
   EGD GI intervention with variceal banding and Dermabond. High
   likelihood of rebleed. Complicated by ongoing coagulopathy/DIC.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations; continue to follow their
   recommendations regarding TIPS and outcomes
   - IV PPI drip
   - Octreotide drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. No growth to date
   of multiple blood cultures since that time of Strep pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently not
   on pressors), CVP > 12, UOP>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. CXR unremarkable consistent with
   volume overload (+16L length of stay), likely associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely component of underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate
   need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 20-40mg prn; likely hold given hypernatremia
   # Goals of Care
   Need to continue discussion with family regarding goals of care.
   Patient currently intubated x 10 days. Will need to discuss PEG, trach
   as potential next steps.
   - Family meeting
   # Hypernatremia
   Likely secondary to ongoing fluid shifts, component of renal failure.
   - Replete free water, D5W
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone. Patient unresponsive to
   voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic component or if
   related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given poor liver
   function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic encephalopathy. Given
   fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or other causes although
   less likely as Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and depression. She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain, and a rash, as well as respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, with a significant episode yesterday resulting in approximately 2.5 liters of blood loss. She underwent an EGD procedure with variceal banding and dermabonding but remains at high risk for rebleeding due to ongoing coagulopathy/DIC. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing coagulopathy/DIC puts her at a high risk for rebleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for yeast, indicating a potential fungal infection. She is also on antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection.
3. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis, and she meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P:F ratio and bilateral infiltrates on CXR.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be related to hepatic encephalopathy, although ammonia levels are not elevated.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient is likely experiencing hypernat"

   broken ribs. Respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure and
   altered mental status primary issues at present.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode yesterday with approximately 2.5L blood per rectum total. S/p
   EGD GI intervention with variceal banding and Dermabond. High
   likelihood of rebleed. Complicated by ongoing coagulopathy/DIC.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations; continue to follow their
   recommendations
   - IV PPI drip
   - Octreotide drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. No growth to date
   of multiple blood cultures since that time of Strep pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently not
   on pressors), CVP > 12, UOP>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. CXR unremarkable consistent with
   volume overload (+16L length of stay), likely associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely component of underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate
   need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 20-40mg prn
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone. Patient unresponsive to
   voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic component or if
   related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given poor liver
   function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic encephalopathy. Given
   fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or other causes although
   less likely as Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)

She also has rib fractures and a history of opioid dependence, diabetes mellitus, acute kidney injury, and a potential insulinoma. Her medical history includes hepatitis C and possible alcohol abuse. She has a MELD score of 29 and is currently on various medications including octreotide, PPI, lasix, and methadone.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Rebleeding from the esophageal varices due to the ongoing coagulopathy/DIC.
2. Progression of sepsis and septic shock due to the ongoing Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia.
3. Fungal infection or dissemination of the current fungal infection.
4. Respiratory failure due to worsening ARDS and potential infection.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function.
6. Abdominal compartment syndrome due to ascites and intra-abdominal pressure.
7. HIV infection due to the presence of pancytopenia and potential exposure.
8. Insulinoma-related hypoglycemia.
9. Acute kidney injury due to hypoperfusion and potential nephrotoxic medications.
10. Further deterioration of mental status due to multiorgan dysfunction.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional clinical assessments and tests may be required for a more accurate evaluation."

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis presenting to the ICU with variceal bleeding and sepsis. The patient underwent endoscopy but continued to bleed, requiring blood product transfusion. He also has ongoing biliary pneumonia and is on high FiO2 due to respiratory failure. The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's variceal bleed has not been controlled despite endoscopic intervention, indicating a high risk of ongoing blood loss and potential re-bleeding.

2. Infection/sepsis: The patient is already septic with suspected S. pneumonia bacteremia and fungemia. This increases the risk of further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is on high FiO2 with ongoing issues. This suggests a high risk of further deterioration in lung function and the need for increased ventilatory support.

4. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis is associated with increasing bilirubin levels, indicating possible hepatic decompensation and worsening liver function. This may lead to hepatic encephalopathy and other complications.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulation issues"

   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, depression who presents with
   abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain and a rash,
   broken ribs. Respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure and
   altered mental status primary issues at present.
   Impression: Liver failure complicated by coma, coagulopathy and gastric
   varices that are now bleeding. Prognosis very poor. Will meet with
   family today to discuss goals of care.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode yesterday with approximately 2.5L blood per rectum total. S/p
   EGD GI intervention with variceal banding and Dermabond. High
   likelihood of rebleed. Complicated by ongoing coagulopathy/DIC.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations; continue to follow their
   recommendations regarding TIPS and outcomes
   - IV PPI drip
   - Octreotide drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until sensitivities.
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. No growth to date
   of multiple blood cultures since that time of Strep pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently not
   on pressors), CVP > 12, UOP>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. CXR unremarkable consistent with
   volume overload (+16L length of stay), likely associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely component of underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate
   need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 20-40mg prn; likely hold given hypernatremia
   # Goals of Care
   Need to continue discussion with family regarding goals of care.
   Patient currently intubated x 10 days. Will need to discuss PEG, trach
   as potential next steps.
   - Family meeting
   # Hypernatremia
   Likely secondary to ongoing fluid shifts, component of renal failure.
   - Replete free water, D5W
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone. Patient unresponsive to
   voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic component or if
   related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given poor liver
   function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic encephalopathy. Given
   fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or other causes although
   less likely as Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG
   tube/currently NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots; elevated INR
   # Access:
   - Double Lumen midline placed [**1-18**]; will need to be removed [**1-22**]

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to Hepatitis C, COPD, and depression. She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain, and a rash. The patient also has broken ribs, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, hepatic failure, and altered mental status.

The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, esophageal varices, impaired skin integrity, pain control, altered mental status, sepsis with organ dysfunction, alteration in nutrition, ascites, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cirrhosis of the liver, coagulopathy, rash, and hypernatremia.

The patient's current condition includes liver failure complicated by coma, coagulopathy, and gastric varices that are now bleeding. The prognosis is very poor. The medical team will meet with the family today to discuss the goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, esophageal dysmotility, and increased risk of infections.

The patient's treatment plan includes maintaining access, IV fluid bolus, albumin, packed red blood cells (pRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2, platelets > 30, IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip, octreotide drip, and monitoring of Hct, INR, and platelets every six hours. The patient will also continue on micafungin until sensitivities are identified. The medical team will follow hepatology recommendations and appreciate their input.

The patient's goals of care need to be discussed with the family, including the possibility of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy. The patient's altered mental status requires minimizing sedation/benzos and continuing lactulose. The patient's transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia are being monitored, and the abdominal rash is improving on therapy.

The patient's cirrhosis is secondary to Hepatitis C and possible EtOH use. The patient's MELD score is 29 today, and alpha-1-anti-trypsin levels are within normal limits. The patient has pancytopenia likely related to Hepatitis C, and there is a consideration for testing for HIV given the recent fungemia. The patient's opioid dependence will be maintained on methadone at last known dose.

The patient's acute kidney injury is improving with fluid resuscitation, and the medical team will avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications. The patient's femoral nerve injury is being managed with IV fluids prn, repletion of electrolytes, and repletion of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a chief complaint of variceal bleed and sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Septic Shock/S. pneumo bacteremia/fungemia: The patient has persistent gastric variceal bleed and has undergone banding and glue treatment. She is also dealing with septic shock caused by S. pneumonia bacteremia and fungemia. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and metronidazole, as well as antifungal medication micafungin.

2. Respiratory failure/bilateral pneumonia: The patient is suffering from respiratory failure due to bilateral pneumonia. She is on mechanical ventilation support with a ventilator set at CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 45 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%.

3. GI bleed/Blood loss anemia: The patient continues to actively bleed, requiring significant ongoing support with blood products. Efforts are being made to correct the international normalized ratio (INR) refractory to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet transfusion.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient's bilirubin levels continue to rise, indicating worsening liver function due to cirrhosis.

   -INR refractory to correction despite sig FFP
   -does bump to plt transfusions
   -Hepatology following closely
 not candidate for TIPS given MELD 29
   -embolization discussed with IR
 not candidate b/c of high likelihood
   of mortality
   -cont supportive care following plt, coags, electrolytes closely given
   large volume transfusion
   -need to discuss goals of care with family since no definitive
   intervention possible and likelihood of stopping on its own given DIC
   is low

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis who has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe complications. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing systemic infection, specifically bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and the patient has been afebrile for 24 hours without the need for pressors.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusions, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is receiving mechanical ventilation according to ARDSnet guidelines.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) along with synthetic issues, resulting in elevated INR refractory to correction.
4. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive and not following simple commands, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose therapy may be necessary.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient's liver function is deteriorating, as indicated by increasing bilirubin levels and a MELD score of 29.
6. Gastric variceal bleed: The patient has ongoing bleeding from gastric varices despite banding and dermabond treatment. She requires continuous support with blood products.
