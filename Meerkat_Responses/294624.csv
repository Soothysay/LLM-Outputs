   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 55% on [**9-2**] echo), recent pulmonary embolism, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure attributed to flash pulmonary edema. The patient is currently sedated and intubated but on a CPAP trial.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure may continue if she is not successfully extubated or if there are any complications during the weaning process.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a trend of increasing white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. This could be due to the urinary tract infection (UTI) from the previous hospitalization.

3. Increasing Troponins: The patient's troponin levels have been increasing at the previous hospital, but they are not higher than 0.5. This may indicate ongoing myocardial damage or ischemia.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.0-1.2, and there is a possibility of acute renal failure, especially in the setting of diuresis.

5. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive during diuresis by report at OSH. This could be a concern for ongoing hypotension"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 55% on 9/2 echo), recent pulmonary embolism (PE) on 2/2181, and recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding attributed to colon diverticuli seen on colonoscopy during a previous hospitalization in 9/25/2181. The patient was transferred from another hospital with respiratory failure attributed to flash pulmonary edema. 

The patient is currently sedated and intubated in the ICU. She is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) but is not yet ready for extubation due to rapid and shallow breathing. The plan is to optimize her cardiac condition, rate control, and hypertension management. 

The patient also has leukocytosis, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) from the previous hospital stay. She has already received broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) for this. 

There are concerns about acute renal failure, which is likely in the setting of diuresis. The baseline creatinine levels are 0.9-1.0, and the plan is to follow up with urine electrolytes, trend creatinine, and dose medications accordingly. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is currently holding beta blockers due to hypotension. Aspirin and statin therapy are also being"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pulmonary edema and gastrointestinal bleeding. Upon admission, the patient was on CPAP trial after achieving a good RSBI (respiratory system compliance and resistance index). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/40 to 148/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 285 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.13 ng/mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 365 mmHg, and oxygen saturation ("

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB), pulmonary edema, and diastolic heart failure. They have a history of allergies to metronidazole, morphine, and Oxycodone/Acetaminophen. The patient is currently on various medications including propofol, furosemide, metoprolol, and others. They are also receiving ICU care and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's diastolic heart failure and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest potential cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may worsen, leading to significant blood loss and anemia.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can further compromise respiratory function.
6. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is being carefully monitored, but there is a risk of developing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 55%), recent pulmonary embolism, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema and is currently sedated and intubated. The patient has leukocytosis, urinary tract infection, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema. Close monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation status will be necessary.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is trending up, indicating a possible infection. Continuous monitoring of the WBC count and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a positive urinary tract infection from the previous hospitalization. Regular assessment of urine output and cultures should be performed to prevent further complications.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD. Optimizing cardiac status, rate control, and blood pressure control are important in managing this condition.
5. Hypertension: The patient was hypotensive during diuresis. Monitoring blood pressure and adjusting antihypertensive medications accordingly will be necessary.
6. Hyperlipidemia: Restarting statin therapy for managing hyperlipidemia should be considered"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 55% on echo), recent pulmonary embolism, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was transferred from another hospital with respiratory failure attributed to flash pulmonary edema. She is currently sedated and intubated in the ICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, as indicated by her dependence on mechanical ventilation. There is a need for continued monitoring and management of her respiratory status.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. It is important to monitor the white blood cell count trend and follow up on cultures to identify any potential sources of infection.

3. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of CAD and hypertension, both of which are risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm and rate control measures should be implemented.

4. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension in the setting of diuresis. Careful monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate titration of medications will be necessary.

5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, for which she was prescribed atorvastatin. Restarting the medication is recommended to manage her lipid levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 55% on 9/2 echo), recent pulmonary embolism, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure attributed to flash pulmonary edema. The patient was initially intubated but later extubated. However, she developed flash pulmonary edema again and required nitroglycerin, labetalol, and furosemide for management. She was also placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure and later developed flash pulmonary edema. This indicates a potential risk for recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has leukocytosis and a positive urine culture showing mixed gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. This suggests a urinary tract infection.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure and recent pulmonary embolism, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive in the setting of diuresis. This indicates a potential risk for hypotension, especially during diuretic therapy.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient needs to restart atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, recent pulmonary embolism, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema and subsequently developed urinary tract infection. The patient has been extubated but required intervention for fluid overload. She has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient continues to have stable blood pressure but may require monitoring and restarting home lasix in the morning. There is a need to consider uptitration of captopril and beta-blocker medications, as well as follow-up with the cardiologist.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed flash pulmonary edema after extubation but was managed with furosemide gtt and blood pressure reduction. Currently, the patient is off labetalol and lasix gtt. Bipap backup support should be continued, along with nasal cannula oxygen and monitoring of I/O status. If not achieving -1 L, IV lasix 40 may be used. Cardiac status should be maximized with HR 70-80 and SBP 110s.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is trending up, and she received Vancomycin and Zosyn for broad coverage."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), recent pulmonary embolism (PE), and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient was intubated and managed with furosemide and blood pressure reduction. She has been extubated but required BiPAP support.

The patient has several ongoing medical conditions that need attention:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed flash pulmonary edema after extubation. She is currently on Bipap backup support, nasal cannula oxygen, and being closely monitored for fluid balance and blood pressure. If her input-output balance is not within normal limits, she may require IV lasix.

2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic CHF is being managed by titrating captopril and considering uptitration of beta-blockers. The goal is to maintain a heart rate of 70-80 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure in the 110s.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which was initially attributed to a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has already received treatment with ciprofloxacin for the UTI. The WBC count should be trended, and further cultures are pending.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's CAD is being managed with beta-blockers, aspirin, and statins.

5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with metoprolol and captopril. BPs should be uptitrated as tolerated.

6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being treated with atorvastatin.

7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine.

8. Urinary Incontinence: The patient has urinary incontinence, and tolterodine has been withheld while she is on a Foley catheter.

The patient's care in the ICU includes cardiac healthy nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is scheduled for transfer to the floor once her condition stabilizes."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who was admitted to the ICU with a history of pulmonary edema, diastolic dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleed, and urinary tract infection. They have completed their course of antibiotics for the UTI. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C (99°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/24 to 127/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with FiO2 at 40%. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2 of 92 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the respiratory system, right lower extremity edema of 1+, left lower extremity edema of 1+, and inability to stand. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, place, and person, and movement, tone, and reflexes are not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 262 K/uL, sodium of 119 mg/dL, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, chloride of 27 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.0 mg/dL, phosphate of 36 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 26.5 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 133 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.11. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and electrolytes.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no significant changes from the previous one, with chronic bilateral pleural effusions noted. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are planned to be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a history of pulmonary edema, and their respiratory system examination shows crackles and wheezes. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is essential to prevent worsening of pulmonary edema.
2. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient has diastolic dysfunction, and their blood pressure readings indicate hypotension at times. It is important to monitor and manage fluid balance carefully to prevent fluid overload.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding recurrence and maintaining glycemic control are crucial.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although the patient has completed their course of antibiotics, it is important to monitor for any signs of UTI recurrence.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immob"
