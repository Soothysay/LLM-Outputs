","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented to the ICU with fevers and hypoxia. He has been hospitalized previously for cellulitis and was discharged on loratadine. The patient's recent symptoms started with chills and malaise, accompanied by a fever of 100.8. His daughter reported that he had been feeling unwell recently. Upon arrival in the emergency department, the patient's temperature was 101Â°F and his pulse rate was 104 bpm. He became hypoxic and required non-rebreather oxygen therapy. The patient also exhibited signs of hypotension with a blood pressure of 80s and responded to fluid resuscitation.

The patient has a history of allergies to cefepime and ciprofloxacin, as well as rashes from those medications. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), azithromycin, and acyclovir. His current infusions include heparin sodium at 1,350 units/hour and other ICU medications such as prednisone, neurontin, folic acid, acyclovir, bactrim, testosterone patch, cyclosporine, oxycontin, and azithromycin.

The patient has a medical history of AML with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the skin and liver"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. The patient presented with fever and hypoxia, and was found to have a small subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) for which heparin was started. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/72 to 100/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen and has been weaned off the nonrebreather mask.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, and he is well-nourished and overweight/obese. He has wheezes on expiration at the lung bases, rhonchi, and upper airway congestion. His cardiovascular examination is normal, and his extremities are warm with erythematous rash over the torso. His neurologic examination is also normal.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, as well as prolonged PT/PTT/INR. Imaging reveals engorged pulmonary vasculature with possible development of infiltrate around the left base, which could indicate pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

The patient's assessment and plan include pain control, treatment for presumed pneumonia/bronchitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo M with AML s/p allo-BMT with chronic GVHD of liver, skin now with
   fever and pulmonary embolism.
   .
   1. Fever: Given the patient's sick contacts it is possible that the
   patient has a viral URI/ bronchitis causing fever as well as
   potentially fever secondary to pulmonary embolism.  However, as the
   patient is s/p BMT and on immunosuppressives, he should be covered by
   broad spectrum antibiotics while cultures are pending.  Though he has
   mild neck/headache, the symptoms are typical for his previous headaches
   and not associated with neck stiffness..  Though on arrival to the
   floor the patient was somewhat somnolent, he has improved in the last
   few hours (change in mental status likely secondary to dilaudid in ER).
   As well the patientt has area on CT that is concerning for pneumonia
   and thus will cover for respiratory infection.
   - vanc, zosyn, azithromycin
   - serial cultures of blood, urine and sputum with fevers
   - AM CXR
   - follow initial cultures, will also send sputum cultures
   - will defer LP for now as no neck stiffness and improved mentation.
   If patient were to need LP, likely to be very complicated given
   patient
s significant back pain and previous surgeries
   2. Pulmonary embolism: the patient had pleuritic chest pain and
   dyspnea, found on prelim read of the CT to have PE in LLL.
   - heparin gtt
   - likely will need chronic anticoagulation
   - LENIs in AM
   .
   3.Hypotension: Unclear etiology but likely secondary to hypovolemia and
   poor PO intake.  Patient may have had preseptic physiology, but is now
   normotensive after 4L NS.  Will continue IVF, following urine output
   and mentation.
   - hold outpatient BP meds, lasix
   - IVF
   4. GHVD: Patient with baseline erythema from GVHD at baseline, per
   patient,
   - Currently on cyclosporin and prednisone
   - will check csa level in AM
   .
   5. AML: s/p unrelated allogenic transplant [**2142**] on
   cyclophosphamide
   - Continued outpatient prophylaxis - ACV, Bactrim and
   Voriconazole
   - check CSA level in AM
   .
   6. Diabetes: Continue outpatient dose of NPH, lispro ss.
   .
   7. Avascular necrosis of hips bilateral: Cause of pain and immobility
   at home.  Will eventually need surgical repair, but patient will need
   further evaluation as outpatient.
   - outpatient pain regimen
   .
   8. RUQ pain: Previous history of GVH of the liver, now with RUQ
   tenderness.  Was to have RUQ ultrasound as outpatient.  Will order
   today.
   - RUQ ultrasound
   .
   9. Elevated creat: Appears to be at baseline when compared to previous
   labs from [**11-10**].  [**Month (only) 60**] be slightly hypovolemic, but could also be

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is chest pain. The CT Chest official read revealed several findings, including a left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism and wedge-shaped peripheral consolidation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. There are also indications of a thoracic vertebral compression fracture.

The patient's medical history includes AML post allo-BMT with chronic GVHD of the liver and skin. They are currently experiencing fever and pulmonary embolism. The patient is immunocompromised due to being post-BMT and on immunosuppressives.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Fever: The patient's sick contacts suggest a possible viral URI/bronchitis causing fever, as well as fever secondary to pulmonary embolism. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started while cultures are pending.

2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea, and a preliminary read of the CT scan indicates a PE in the LLL. Heparin gtt has been initiated, and chronic anticoagulation may be necessary. LENIs will be done in the morning.

3. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear but may be due to hypovolemia and poor PO intake. The patient has been given 4L NS, and IV fluids will continue to be administered. Outpatient BP medications have been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently experiencing chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents with fever, pulmonary embolism, hypotension, skin erythema from GVHD, diabetes, avascular necrosis of the hips, back pain, and RUQ pain. The patient is receiving multiple medications including azithromycin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for infection, as well as cyclosporine and prednisone for GVHD. He is also on outpatient prophylaxis for infections. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has persistent oxygen requirements and desaturation when sleeping. His peripheral pulses are diminished in both lower extremities, and he has pedal edema. Laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever and continued oxygen requirement, suggesting a possible respiratory infection. The CT scan findings of wedge-shaped consolidation in the right lower lobe raise the possibility of pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The CT pulmonary angiography revealed a left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism, and the patient has persistent leg edema.
3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pulmonary embolism and hypoxemia. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications, including cefepime and ciprofloxacin. The patient is currently receiving IV heparin for the pulmonary embolism, and their hemodynamic status is stable. An echocardiogram is being performed to assess the situation further. The patient's oxygen saturation levels are in the 90s when using supplemental oxygen with a 70% mask. Cultures have come back negative, indicating no signs of infection. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics but is now on prophylactic antibiotics for a bone marrow transplant. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Pulmonary Embolism: Given the patient's chronic issues with lower extremities, there is a risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are consistently below normal, indicating inadequate oxygenation.
3. Sepsis: Despite negative cultures, the patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, as indicated by crackles and wheezing in the lungs, which may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of chronic pain in the lower extremities increases the risk of developing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the liver and skin. He presented with fever and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has evidence of lower extremity edema and continues to require supplemental oxygen. His current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and other BMT prophylactic medications. The patient's recent labs show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal creatinine and glucose levels. His respiratory culture is pending, and he has tested negative for influenza and Legionella. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. The respiratory culture is pending, which could identify the causative organism.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient currently has a pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential organ dysfunction if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, indicating potential hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary.
4. GVHD: The patient has chronic GVHD involving the liver and skin, which may require ongoing immunosuppressive therapy to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an unrelated allogenic transplant in [**2142**]. He presented to the ICU with fever, and further evaluation revealed pulmonary embolism (PE) and potential infarct in the left lower lobe of the lung. The patient has been experiencing generalized aches, pain, difficulty with CPAP, and continued chest congestion.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been febrile, and his oxygen requirements have increased, indicating a possible worsening of the PE. He is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to his immunosuppressed state. Microbiology data is pending.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a confirmed PE in the left lower lobe of the lung. He also has persistent leg edema and ongoing desaturation while sleeping. This suggests a potential worsening of the PE. The patient is on heparin gtt with a goal PTT of 70 and will undergo a lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) to evaluate for clot burden. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is being considered, and the patient will start warfarin in the next 24-48 hours, pending the necessity of the procedure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently experiencing chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents with fever, pulmonary embolism (PE), and right lower extremity edema. Laboratory findings show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and prolonged prothrombin time (PTT). Imaging studies reveal left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) confirms a pulmonary embolism in the left lower lobe. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including azithromycin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis. The presence of right lower extremity edema and elevated D-dimer levels indicate a higher risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE.
2. Organ Dysfunction: While the patient currently does not have organ dysfunction, the presence of sepsis and PE increases the risk of organ failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), or hepatic dysfunction.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is below the normal range,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and now has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the liver and skin. He presents with fever and is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient also has pulmonary embolism (PE), which was confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA). Additionally, he has bilateral lower extremity edema and continues to require supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, and creatinine levels. His electrolytes are within normal range, but he has an elevated calcium level. The respiratory culture shows gram-positive rods and budding yeast, indicating a possible bacterial and fungal infection.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics (azithromycin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam), antivirals (acyclovir), and immunosuppressants (cyclosporin and prednisone). He is also receiving enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and heparin for anticoagulation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of sepsis, progression of pulmonary embolism, further development of graft-versus-host disease, and complications related to diabetes and chronic pain management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an unrelated allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**2142**]. He presents with fever and is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the liver and skin. He also has pulmonary embolism (PE) with left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, likely due to a combination of atelectasis and developing infarct. The patient has persistent left lower extremity edema, indicating a potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and immunosuppressants. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 103/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 3L nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals right basilar rales and course breath sounds throughout, as well as bilateral pedal/leg edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and hyponatremia. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is currently on azithromycin, vancomycin, and zosyn due to his immunosuppressed state. The plan includes weaning off oxygen, following cultures, continuing antibiotics, and performing a chest CT. The patient's pain, diabetes, avascular necrosis of hips, back pain, and previous history of GVHD are stable and being managed accordingly. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the BMT unit when stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening pulmonary embolism: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement and desaturation when sleeping are concerning for a worsening PE. Close monitoring and adjustment of treatment accordingly are necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's persistent left lower extremity edema suggests a potential DVT. Further evaluation with lower extremity venous ultrasound is needed to confirm the diagnosis, and appropriate anticoagulation therapy should be initiated.
3. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's fever persists. Monitoring of fever trends, culture results, and response to antibiotics is crucial. Adjustments in antibiotic therapy may be necessary based on microbiology data.
4. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension resolved with IV fluids. Ongoing monitoring of blood pressure and urine output is required. Holding outpatient BP medications and restarting beta-blocker therapy after hemodynamic stability should be considered.
5. Graft-versus-host disease: The patient's chronic GVHD of the liver and skin requires ongoing immunosuppressive therapy. Monitoring liver function tests and skin lesions"

The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature are within normal limits. The patient has 3+ edema in the right lower extremity and 3+ edema in the left lower extremity. There are diffuse coarse rales and rhonchi, expiratory wheeze, and prolonged exhalation on lung examination. The patient's abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The patient has warm skin with no rash or jaundice. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, and has purposeful movement. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and a slightly elevated creatinine level. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on 11/22/2144 at 07:10 AM, 11/23/2144 at 03:54 AM, and 11/24/2144 at 04:32 AM. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other ICU medications are documented. The patient's overall condition appears to be improving, but they still require critical care in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an unrelated allogenic transplant in [2142] and now presents with symptoms of sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, pulmonary embolism (PE), and hypotension. The patient has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the liver and skin and is currently being treated with cyclosporin and prednisone. He also has a history of diabetes, avascular necrosis of the hips, chronic back pain, previous history of GVHD of the liver, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and positive Gram-positive cocci in sputum indicate a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is necessary. Thrombolytics may be considered if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which could be due to fluid overload or sepsis. Careful monitoring of fluid balance and blood pressure is essential.
4. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient has chronic GVHD of the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's sputum culture revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs, chains, and clusters, along with 2+ budding yeast, but no Pneumocystis jirovecii. The respiratory viral culture confirmed the presence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The patient was on a lasix drip for gentle diuresis and had a fever of 101.6 after taking Tylenol.

Allergies were noted for cefepime and ciprofloxacin Hcl, both causing rashes. The patient received multiple antibiotics including azithromycin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), voriconazole, acyclovir, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and piperacillin.

The patient's review of systems remained unchanged from admission except for mild right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and cough with sputum production (CP). The patient denied shortness of breath (SOB).

Flowsheet data showed vital signs with a temperature of 38.7Â°C (101.6Â°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/73 mmHg to 144/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of"

","The patient is a 72-inch, 105 kg well-nourished obese male presenting with a chief complaint of pulmonary embolism, fever, and pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, acute pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and obstructive sleep apnea. 

On the current day, the patient's temperature is 101.6Â°F (38.7Â°C) with a maximum temperature of 101.7Â°F (38.7Â°C) at 05:00 AM. Blood pressure readings are 121/83 mmHg, 97/56 mmHg, and 144/90 mmHg. Heart rate ranges from 68 to 125 bpm, respiratory rate is 12-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 89%. The patient's blood cultures were obtained at 05:32 AM. 

The patient has been diuresed with lasix infusion most of yesterday but it was stopped when blood pressure dropped. The patient is currently receiving acyclovir for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 

The patient has multiple allergies to cefepime, ciprofloxacin Hcl, and azithromycin. The patient has received various antibiotics including Bactrim, azithromycin, voriconazole, acyclovir, piperacillin/tazobactam, piperacillin, vancomycin, and enoxaparin. 

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of 1,813 mL total in, 400 mL PO, 720 mL TF, 1,413 mL IVF, 2,525 mL total out, and a negative balance of 712 mL. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 105 kg. 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished, non-distressed, overweight male with no acute distress. The patient's eyes are normal, and there are no signs of conjunctival pallor or scleral edema. The head, ears, nose, and throat examination is normal with no endotracheal or nasogastric tubes present. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and no murmurs. The respiratory/chest examination reveals wheezes and scattered rhonchi with a prolonged expiratory phase. 

Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The extremities show 2+ edema in both the right and left legs. The musculoskeletal examination is unremarkable. The skin examination is warm and free of rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, and has purposeful movement without muscle wasting or paralysis. 

Laboratory values include a white blood cell count ranging from 3.5 to 4.1 K/uL, hem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT). He is currently experiencing fevers, shortness of breath, and has a past medical history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting his liver and skin.
- The patient's fever has resolved after receiving a second dose of synagist. Chest X-ray shows stable left lower lobe opacity with improvement in the right lung opacity.
- The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) in the left lower lobe, as confirmed by computed tomography angiography (CTA). No evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is present.
- The patient's hypotension appears to be resolved, but he has developed lower extremity edema.
- He is currently on immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD, including cyclosporin and prednisone.
- The patient also has a history of diabetes, avascular necrosis of the hips, back pain, RUQ pain, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
- His current medications include enoxaparin (Lovenox) for prophylaxis against thromboembolism, as well as antibiotics for infection prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogenic transplant. He presents with fever and shortness of breath. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has multiple medical conditions, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, pulmonary embolism (PE), pain control, chronic pain, diabetes, avascular necrosis of hips, back pain, RUQ pain, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and febrile neutropenia (FEN).

The patient has been afebrile for 48 hours, but still requires supplemental oxygen. He has been on CPAP with a full-face mask and has tolerated it for about 6 hours with occasional apnea up to 6 seconds. The patient's SpO2 has been between 92-97% on 10 liters per minute of oxygen. Nebulized albuterol has been administered twice, but there has been no change in audible expiratory wheeze, and the patient has thick white secretions. A repeat RSV nasal swab has been done.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/79 to 104/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 90%. The patient's weight remains"
