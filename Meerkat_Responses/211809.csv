   addition, BUN slightly elevated. Pt with recent heavy NSAID use and
   daily ETOH. Pt with 10pt HCT drop over 4 hrs. Since that time, he was
   given 2L IVF and is now currently getting his 3rd unit of PRBCs. Pt
   sinus tachy,  but normotensive. Also could be LGIB from

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with no past medical history who was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He experienced a pre-syncopal episode after undergoing a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and nuclear medicine scan. The patient has a history of heavy NSAID use and daily alcohol consumption.

During the procedure, the patient's hemoglobin levels dropped from 30.8 to 26.7 g/dL, indicating significant blood loss. He received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a venti mask.

Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds, supple neck, and no signs of distress. Laboratory results show elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, and hemoglobin are within normal limits.

The patient's current assessment includes likely upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to possible peptic ulcer disease, given the melena (black, tarry stools) and recent heavy NSAID use. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) could also be a possibility due to diverticula or colitis. An upper endoscopy (EGD) is planned tonight to investigate the source of the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with no previous medical history admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He experienced a pre-syncopal episode after undergoing a colonoscopy, which revealed blood up to the transverse colon but no active bleeding. A nuclear medicine scan indicated bleeding near the splenic flexure, and angiography did not identify the source. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is tachycardic and hypotensive at times. He has received multiple blood transfusions and has a low hemoglobin level. The patient has a history of heavy NSAID use and daily alcohol consumption. He has dark stools, indicating ongoing bleeding. Further evaluation and management are planned, including repeat colonoscopy, CT scan, and consideration for a massive transfusion protocol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's dark stools suggest ongoing bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock if not controlled.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's low blood pressure and tachycardia may be due to blood loss, leading to decreased tissue perfusion.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to invasive procedures and the presence of IV lines.
4. Coagulopathy: Repeated blood transfusions can disrupt the patient's normal coagulation pathways, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Organ dysfunction: Prolonged hypotension and hypoperfusion can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of vasovagal episodes. He presented with bradycardia, hypotension, and continued active bleeding. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed blood but no active bleeding site identified. A red blood cell scan suggested bleeding near the terminal ileum. The patient received a total transfusion of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in 24 hours. He has allergies to Demerol (Meperidine Hcl) and experiences nausea/vomiting as a side effect. The patient is currently on midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, calcium, magnesium, and potassium chloride. His medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except for the mentioned above.

24-hour events:
- EGD was normal.
- Colonoscopy identified a full colon full of blood extending to the terminal ileum.
- Red blood cell scan suggested bleeding near the terminal ileum.
- Total transfusion: 7 units in 24 hours.

Physical examination:
- General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress, not overweight/obese.
- Head, ears, nose, throat: Normocephalic.
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds (S1 and S2), regular heart rhythm, radial and dorsalis pedis pulses present bilaterally."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of vasovagal episodes. He presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and continued active bleeding despite receiving a 7-unit packed red blood cell transfusion. Endoscopy down to the third part of the duodenum showed no active bleeding site, and a red blood cell scan suggested bleeding near the terminal ileum. However, an angiogram did not reveal any extravasation of contrast to suggest a localizable focus of gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of the bleeding remains unknown.

The patient has allergies to Demerol (Oral) and experiences nausea/vomiting as a side effect. He is currently on midazolam and fentanyl infusions, as well as pantoprazole, calcium, magnesium, and potassium chloride.

Review of Systems is unchanged from admission except for the cardiovascular system, where he experiences no chest pain or palpitations. The patient is not receiving nutritional support and has no signs or concerns for abuse. He reports no pain and appears comfortable.

Flowsheet Data shows that the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F) with a current temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (61-120 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 141/90 mmHg to 148/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with no prior medical history who was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He experienced a pre-syncopal episode and had an abdominal CT scan that revealed a small mass in the small intestine. The patient received calcium gluconate due to low ionized calcium levels and underwent two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase his hematocrit from 26.5% to 31.7%. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/91 mmHg to 112/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg. He has received pantoprazole infusion and other medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient was admitted for GIB, and despite receiving PRBCs, he continues to have dark stools, indicating ongoing bleeding. This can lead to hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.

2. Small intestinal mass: The presence of a small mass in the small intestine may require surgical resection. Surgical complications such as bleeding, infection, or anastomotic leak can occur during and after the procedure.

3. Pre-syncopal episode: The patient experienced"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with a brisk gastrointestinal bleed (GIB). The bleeding is likely due to a small bowel mass, as confirmed by radiographic imaging. The patient is currently in the ICU and awaiting surgery. He has an unlimited exercise tolerance and no cardiac history, making him at a very low risk for cardiac complications during surgery. There is no need for perioperative beta blockers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient already has a brisk GIB, which can lead to hypovolemia and shock if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient is critically ill and may be at an increased risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT formation.
4. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach, which can lead to further bleeding.
5. Cardiac complications: Although the patient is considered to be at a very low risk for cardiac complications during surgery, there is still a small possibility of perioperative cardiac events occurring.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and assessment may be required."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with brisk gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely caused by a small bowel mass consistent with GIST. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/78 mmHg to 152/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient has received a total of 5 units of blood products in the last 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show normal hemoglobin (11.2 g/dL), leukocyte count (121 K/uL), platelet count (94 mg/dL), sodium (139 mEq/L), potassium (3.9 mEq/L), and glucose levels (80 mg/dL). However, the patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.7 mg/dL. The coagulation profile shows an INR of 1.1, and the differential white blood cell count reveals neutrophils at 82.1%, lymphocytes at 14.3%, monocytes at 2.8%, eosinophils at 0.6%, and basophils at 0.4%. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance with no acute"
