   ===========================
   Patient with what started like a typical URI but progressed to chills,
   sweats, and cough productive of green sputum. The sputum has become
   more white with azithromycin started as an outpatient. With elevated
   LDH, concern for PCP but the fact that the patient is much improved
   this AM, argues against PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] alternative explanation is that he
   developed a bacterial superinfection superimposed on an initial viral
   process. This could explain the cavity as well, if he has a necrotizing
   pneumonia. Alternatively given his drug use hx, the abscess may be old,
   reflecting prior aspiration. Continue present antibiotics, but if he
   continues to get better quickly, I would consider stopping treatment
   for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 9239**] continues to improve. Try to change supplemental oxygen to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress, pulmonary embolism, chronic hepatitis, and HIV/AIDS. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on a 50% face tent with O2 sats in the mid-90s. The patient has allergies to sulfonamides and had a rash as a result of the last dose of antibiotics, piperacillin.

The patient is receiving various medications including HAART, vancomycin, clindamycin, primaquin, azithromycin, and prednisone. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 73 bpm (67-83), blood pressure ranging from 106/67 to 104/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (16-30), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received a total of 192 mL of IV fluids and has had no blood product transfusions. The patient's urine output is 300 mL, and there is a negative fluid balance of 508 mL.

The patient is on respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and has an ABG showing pH 7.43, PaCO2 43, and PaO2 118. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of overweight/obesity. The patient's eyes, conjunctiva, and head/ears/nose/throat are normal. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal PMI, S1, S2, and no murmurs, rubs, S3, or S4. Respiratory/chest examination reveals crackles/rales in the lungs. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Musculoskeletal examination is normal. Skin examination shows no rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Lab results include TCO2 29, alk phos/total bilirubin 6.0, lactic acid 1.0 mmol/L, and LDH 344. Imaging shows ground glass opacities in the left greater than right lungs, particularly in the lower lobes, along with a cavity in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe. A CTA was negative for PE.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP), and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP). The patient also has HIV/AIDS.

The patient initially presented with symptoms resembling a typical upper respiratory infection (URI) but progressed to chills, sweats, and cough productive of green sput"

   This is a 40 year old man with AIDS and a CD4 count of 12, as well as
   genotype 1b Hepatitis C, recently restarting HAART.
   PULMONARY INFLAMMATION
   In the setting of AIDS, the differential for pulmonary inflammation is
   broad, however his rapid improvement makes a viral etiology likely in
   this setting, since his recovery began the first day of antibiotic
   treatment.  Cavitation seen on CT concerning for possible TB vs. an
   anaerobic abscess, in the setting of night sweats and poor induced
   sputum production will bronch and send BAL for AFB and culture.  Will
   continue [**Year (4 digits) 9262**] for PCP and anaerobic coverage, continue primaquin for

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 40 year old man with AIDS and a CD4 count of 12, as well as
   genotype 1b Hepatitis C, recently restarting HAART.
   PULMONARY INFLAMMATION
   In the setting of AIDS, the differential for pulmonary inflammation is
   broad. The small patchy ground-glass opacities, as opposed to more
   confluent regions, are less consistent with PCP and more [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/w fungal
   infection; however, PCP has protean manifestations and the clinical
   course, high A-A gradient, worse appearance on CT scan than on x-ray,
   and cavitating process are all consistent with this. Would treat PCP
   given its common frequency in people with this CD4 count; would not
   treat fungal infection empirically yet. Picture is not consistent with
   cardiologic origin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 40-year-old male with AIDS and a CD4 count of 12. He has genotype 1b Hepatitis C and is restarting HAART. The patient presented to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath and was placed on non-rebreather. He has indirect hyperbilirubinemia, mild scleral icterus, and a cavitary lesion on CT scan. Possible diagnoses include PCP, fungal pneumonia, and bacterial infection.

The patient is currently being treated empirically for PCP with prednisone and primaquine/clindamycin (due to sulfa allergy). He is also receiving zosyn, clindamycin, and azithromycin for atypical bacterial infection and anaerobic coverage. Levofloxacin has been ordered overnight, and azithro covers for possible mycobacterial infection. The patient's LDH may be elevated due to liver disease rather than PCP, and fungal coverage has been withheld until results are available.

Further tests include sputum cultures, viral cultures, beta-glucan, galactomannan, and legionella tests. The patient's respiratory support includes an O2 delivery device and nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 93%. ABG results show ///21/. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the base and slight inspiratory/expiratory wheezes, with diminished air movement throughout, more so on the left lower lung"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and presenting symptoms of pneumonia, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. The patient's condition has improved significantly with supplemental oxygen and antibiotic treatment. There are concerns about tuberculosis due to nightsweats and lung abscess, but the physician believes an indolent anaerobic infection is more likely. The patient will undergo bronchoscopy for further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen and there is no indication of VAP at this time. However, if the patient develops respiratory distress again and requires mechanical ventilation, VAP may become a potential complication.
2. Tuberculosis (TB): Although the physician does not believe TB is the primary cause, the presence of nightsweats and lung abscess raises concerns for TB infection. It is important to rule out TB through appropriate testing and monitoring.
3. Drug-resistant infection: In patients with HIV/AIDS, there is an increased risk of drug-resistant infections. The choice of antibiotics should be carefully considered to ensure effectiveness against potential resistant strains.
4. Pulmonary sequestration: A lung abscess may indicate an underlying issue such as pulmonary sequestration, where a portion of the lung is not receiving adequate blood supply. Further evaluation may be needed to rule out this condition.
5. HIV/AIDS progression: While the patient's immediate symptoms have improved, it is essential to continue managing the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with AIDS and a CD4 count of 12. He also has genotype 1b Hepatitis C and is restarting HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy). The patient's main medical issues include pulmonary inflammation, potential tuberculosis (TB), and possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

The patient's recent history includes completion of a 5-day course of azithromycin and initiation of ambulation. He is currently on multiple medications, including HAART, primaquine for PCP prophylaxis, and an antibiotic regimen for anaerobic coverage.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/58 to 125/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -500 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the lung bases, slight inspiratory/expiratory wheezes, diminished air movement throughout with shallow breathing, and decreased air movement on the left lower lung field. There is no evidence of rash, jaundice, or peripheral edema. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to situation, place, and"

   On this day I examined the patient and reviewed his history and
   hospital course. I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9311**]
s note above and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  The patient looks and feels well, so much
   better than a few days ago. The plan is to continue Rx for PCP upon
   discharge today,  with Clinda and Primaquine, but also to initiate MAC
   prophylaxis with Azithro. The pt seems motivated to take these meds and
   his HAART meds and to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9235**].

","Summary:
- The patient is a 40-year-old male with AIDS and a CD4 count of 12. He also has genotype 1b Hepatitis C and is restarting HAART.
- The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary inflammation, most likely due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), as indicated by a positive BAL for PCP.
- His symptoms improved after starting antibiotic treatment, and he completed a 5-day course of azithromycin.
- The patient will be discharged today with prescriptions for primaquine and clindamycin for PCP prophylaxis.
- He is currently not open to social work input regarding substance abuse.
- The patient's HIV/AIDS management will continue according to the outpatient plan provided by Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 9235**].
- The patient has an outpatient follow-up scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9235**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of PCP: Since the patient has a low CD4 count, he is at risk for recurring PCP infections. It is important for him to complete the prescribed prophylactic treatment with primaquine and clindamycin.
2. Opportunistic infections: With his compromised immune system, the patient is susceptible to other opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Regular monitoring and appropriate treatment should be considered if any signs or symptoms arise.
3. Hepatitis C progression: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with AIDS and a CD4 count of 12, as well as genotype 1b Hepatitis C. He recently restarted HAART therapy. The patient presented with pulmonary inflammation, and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was positive for PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He was initially started on antibiotics but did not have primaquine, which is needed for PCP treatment. The patient's symptoms improved with antibiotic treatment, suggesting a viral etiology. He is currently on a 5-day course of azithromycin and will be discharged today with primaquine/clindamycin for PCP. The patient's HIV/AIDS requires continued HAART therapy, and he has an outpatient follow-up scheduled with Dr. [Last Name]. The patient also has a history of substance abuse but denies any current use, and his toxicology screen on admission was negative. In the ICU, the patient is receiving regular diet, prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, and vaporator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be discharged home today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): The patient's initial presentation suggests PCP, which is common in individuals with AIDS and low CD4 counts. Without proper treatment, PCP can"

   broad, however his rapid improvement makes a viral etiology likely in
   this setting, since his recovery began the first day of antibiotic
   treatment.  BAL

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with AIDS and a CD4 count of 12. He also has genotype 1b Hepatitis C and is restarting HAART. The patient presented with pulmonary inflammation, and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was positive for PCP. He was initially planned for discharge but was kept overnight due to the unavailability of primaquine, which is needed for PCP prophylaxis. The patient is also allergic to sulfonamides and has a rash as a result.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 70 bpm (normal range: 66-92 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 119/73 mmHg to 136/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has no peripheral edema or cyanosis. His neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, and electrolyte levels are also normal. Other lab results indicate mild elevations in creatinine and potassium levels.

The patient's respiratory support includes none, and he has been ambulating without difficulty. He is expected to be discharged"
