","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from an outside hospital with a loculated hemopneumothorax, worsening hypoxia, and somnolence. The patient has received multiple doses of oxycodone but the last dose was around October 12th. A head CT was negative for acute changes. He has a history of prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and it is possible that his deficits are returning in the setting of illness. 

Assessment and Plan:
- Treat infection
- Monitor electrolytes
- LP negative, suspicious for meningitis given neck posture
- Cover for pseudomonas with cefepime
- Repeat blood cultures
- Follow-up cultures
- Follow-up outside hospital for culture data
- CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism in setting of bloody effusions
- Repeat cytology
- Repeat pleural studies from bilateral pleural fluid
- Continue statin and ASA for CAD
- Look into old notes and start low-dose beta blocker if no contraindications
- Stable hypertension treatment with amlodipine
- Dialysis team following ESRD and anemia secondary to dialysis
- Insulin sliding scale for diabetes management
- Midline and left-sided AV fistula for hemodialysis access
- Tube feeds with Renal (Full) nutrition at 35 mL/hour
- Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis
- Code status: Full code

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for an infection, likely pneumonia caused by pseudomonas. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent worsening of the infection and potential complications such as sepsis or meningitis.
2. Meningitis: Given the patient's neck posture and negative lumbar puncture (LP) results, there is suspicion for meningitis. Close monitoring and repeat LP may be necessary to rule out meningitis.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on heparin prophylaxis. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been ordered to rule out PE in the setting of bloody effusions. It is important to manage this complication promptly to prevent further respiratory distress.
4. Hypertension: The patient has stable hypertension and is currently on amlodipine. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and adjustment of medication may be necessary to maintain blood pressure within the normal range.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia secondary to ESRD. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and appropriate management by the dialysis team"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from an outside hospital with a loculated hemopneumothorax, worsening hypoxia, and somnolence. The patient has pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas, which is being treated with antibiotics. His left pneumothorax appears mostly resolved. The reason for the bloody effusion is unclear, and further investigations are needed to determine the cause. The patient's somnolence has improved, and a head CT was negative for acute changes. He has a history of a prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and possible returning deficits. The patient's electrolytes should be monitored, and he received dialysis yesterday. There are concerns about meningitis, and cultures are pending. The patient's CAD status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) should be managed with appropriate medications. His hypertension is stable, and he is on amlodipine. The patient has ESRD and is on dialysis. He also has diabetes and is on insulin sliding scale. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through tube feeds, and he is receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. His arterial line was inserted yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred to the hospital with a loculated hemopneumothorax, worsening hypoxia, and somnolence. The patient has pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which he is being treated with ceftazidime. He also has a left pneumothorax that appears mostly resolved, and all chest tubes are on water suction. The reason for the bloody effusion is unclear. The patient's somnolence has improved, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. His past medical history includes CABG surgery, hypertension, and diabetes. The patient is on dialysis for ESRD and has anemia secondary to this. He is also receiving tube feeds and prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has pneumonia and a loculated hemopneumothorax, which could lead to further infection and complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating a risk of hypotension.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory support and ABG results suggest a risk of respiratory distress.
4. Bleeding: The presence of bloody effusion and the need for intermittent tPA"
