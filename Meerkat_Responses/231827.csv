   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M history of wegener's with baseline creatinine 1.2, PE [**11-17**],
   stable meningioma, AS with [**Location (un) 549**] 1, gout, who presented with altered
   mental status and was found to have new liver failure
   1. Liver failure: initial concernf for primary fulminant liver failure,
   now appears most consistent with biliary process, remote history of
   etoh hepatitis
    - liver and tox service following
    - continue NAC
    - hepatitis panel pending
    - trending LFTs
   2. Mental status changes: uremia versus hepatic encephalopathy
    - likely not HD candidate at this moment for uremia
    - frequent neuro checks
    - holding lactulose in setting of GI bleed
   3. Coagulopathy: unclear source, holding a/c, has ivc filter in place
   4. Biliary process: gallstones, pneumobilia, possible enterobiliary
   fisutla
    - surgical services following,
    - considering percutanous gallbladder drain
    - will cont vanc/zosyn
   5. Acute renal failure:  sediment consistent with ATN
    - renal service following, no acute indication for HD, continue to
   trend electrolytes
   6. Gout:
    - continue prednisone for now at 40 mg, understanding that he is at
   increased risk for infection an dpossible wound healing, will discuss
   with his PCP regarding indication for prednisone/gout
    - holding colchicine
   7. GIB: hct drop tp 20 in setting of INR 20, responded to 3 uPRBCs no
   active s/sx bleed but egd would be useful to assess possible
   varices/gastritis
    - cont trend hct and t/f < 26 or s/sx bleed

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, aortic stenosis, gout, and previous ethanol hepatitis.
- The patient presented with altered mental status and was found to have new liver failure.
- The patient was intubated for airway protection and to facilitate mechanical ventilation due to acute onset atrial fibrillation with rapid response that responded to beta blockade.
- The patient received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 10 units of vitamin K, which improved the INR from 20 to 3.
- The patient has several allergies, including lisinopril causing angioedema.
- The patient's last doses of antibiotics were piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 05/24/2159 at 08:17 PM, vancomycin on 05/24/2159 at 09:00 PM, and micafungin on 05/25/2159 at 04:04 AM.
- The patient is currently receiving phenylephrine and propofol infusions.
- Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) on 05/25/2159 at 08:55 AM.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current presentation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, aortic stenosis, gout, and previous ethanol hepatitis. He presented with altered mental status and was found to have new-onset liver failure. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and to facilitate mechanical ventilation. He developed atrial fibrillation, which responded to beta-blockade. The patient received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 10 units of vitamin K, resulting in improvement in INR from 20 to 3. He is allergic to lisinopril and has a history of angioedema. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for an elevated heart rate of 103 bpm. The patient's respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 22 mEq/L, base excess of -2, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of"

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice:  imaging c/w gallstone ileus, may have
   associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improving
   slowly . Initial concern for fulminant liver failure on presentation,
   but  less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated.
   Bandemia when arrived, concern for biliary sepsis
   - f/up IR re: drain function
   - f/up bile culture final
 cont Zosyn / Vanc
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   -- F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue gentle  fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs 8-10
   - goal net even if possible / esp given meningioma hx
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR : Per discussion with his partner this is a new issue
   for patient.  Most likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain.
   Currently he is back in NSR.
   .
   -follow tele closely
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 changed from 5mg q4 to
   q6 dosing
   - given transaminitis will hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today, appears more awake today  and has + gag
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - f/up GI recs
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q8 HCts for now , transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status:
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia given Cr 1.2 to >4 range
 also
   considered hepatic encephalopathy. No evidence of seizure activity. CT
   head with 2mm hyperdensity stable on serial imaging, not clearly a
   bleed, unlikely contributory to the current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q6h neuro checks
   - f/up neurosurgery recommendations
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   .
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra & dilantin
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now w/Solumedrol
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners. Renal feels this is not ARF
   related to Wegeners now.  Possibly pre-renal evolving to ATN.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented

   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs

   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism (PE), and no known history of active liver disease. The patient presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and was found to have encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy by interventional radiology (IR) with drainage of malodorous fluid. He also experienced episodes of hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR), and required vasopressor support. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin, and abnormal kidney function tests. Blood cultures are pending, and imaging studies reveal a large stone in the gallbladder, air in the common duct and gallbladder neck, diffuse dilation of fluid-filled proximal small bowel, and evidence of cirrhosis.

The patient's medical complications include suspected gallstone ileus, possible biliary enteric fistula, acute on chronic renal failure, sepsis, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), altered mental status, and hypernatremia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, hepatic en"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and no known history of active liver disease. He presented to the emergency department with one day of altered mental status and was found to have encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystotomy and has shown improvement in liver function tests and bilirubin levels. He remains on pressors for hypotension, which is suspected to be due to sepsis, relative hypovolemia in the setting of post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis and blood loss, as well as possible adrenal insufficiency. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, for which metoprolol has been started. He is intubated for airway protection and is being weaned to pressure support ventilation. The patient has coagulopathy with an improved INR following vitamin K administration. He is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to a history of melena and coagulopathy. There are concerns about altered mental status, possibly related to uremia or hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is holding on dialysis. There are also concerns about hypernatremia, gout, Wegeners, pulmonary embolism, and aortic stenosis. The"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism (PE), and known heart condition. He presented to the emergency department with one day of altered mental status and was found to have encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystotomy by interventional radiology (IR) due to suspected gallstone ileus. His liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels are trending down. Initially, there were concerns for fulminant liver failure, but it seems less likely now.

The patient remains on pressors overnight and is suspected to have sepsis along with relative hypovolemia in the setting of post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis and blood loss. His atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR) is likely precipitated by his acute illness. He is currently on metoprolol, and anticoagulation is held due to bleeding and coagulopathy.

The patient has transaminitis, which is likely secondary to gallstone ileus. He has been placed on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for biliary sepsis. Cultures are pending, and antibiotics will be discontinued if cultures are negative within 48 hours.

The patient's altered mental status is suspected to be due to uremia and possibly hepatic encephalopathy. He has a history of seizures, but there is no evidence of worsening central nervous system (CNS) process on the CT head.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to ATN. Good urine output is noted, indicating post-ATN diuresis. Hemodialysis (HD) is not indicated at this time.

The patient has a history of Wegeners, but there are no signs of a flare at present. He has a history of gout and was on prednisone for it. He is also on low-dose steroids at home.

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism with right heart strain and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. He is currently on warfarin, and vitamin K has been given to reverse the INR.

The patient has mild aortic valve stenosis and is being monitored for fluid overload.

Overall, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications including encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal failure, suspected sepsis, afib/RVR, coagulopathy, potential gallstone ileus, and a history of various other conditions such as meningioma,"

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, and new onset acute fulminant liver failure
   and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Highest concern for hepatic encephalopathy with labs showing hepatic
   failure, asterixis. Also could have component of uremia with acute on
   chronic renal failure.  Also has known seizure disorder with meningioma
   which has been stable - no evidence of seizure. No recent depression,
   known high risk factors for overdosing on medications.
   CT head with 2mm hyperdensity
 not clearly a bleed, reviewed with
   neurosurg
 unlikely contributory to current presentation
   - elective intubation for airway protection overnight
   - Q2h neuro checks
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   - will discuss to renal ?HD
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient on coumadin anticoagulation for outpatient.
   Unclear why would have acute coagulopathy (medication interaction, poor
   PO, dehydration, biliary process). INR>20.2 in ED.
   Good response to FFP overnight, vitK
   - hold warfarin
   - type screen x 2
   - IV PPI
   - watch closely for bleeding as at high risk, trend Hct Q6hr, transfuse
   to keep Hct>25
   .
   # Liver failure:
   Suspect [**3-13**] biliary process
   Patient in advanced fulminant liver failure with exam findings,
   INR>20.2 on admission. Unclear history - no active liver disease but
   upon further review of records, did have mention of alcoholic hepatitis
   in past and US did show mild cirrhosis of liver. Reasons for acute
   decompensation or fulminant liver failure include tylenol ingestion,
   ETOH (although no history to suggest), hepatitis (but no recent
   food/travel exposures to suggest this). No evidence of septic
   physiology, recent infection. Also checking other etiologies of liver
   failure including autoimmune hepatitis. Got NAC overnight.
   - Consider percutaneous biliary drain placement by IR, will discuss
   with surgery
   - Continue vanc/zosyn x48h, if negative consider dc. Will stop
   micafungin today.
   - Ok to continue NAC, will discuss with liver
   - FSBG Q4h, synthetic function
   - Transplant recs appreciated
   - f/u serologic panel for liver transplant eval (hepatitis panel,
   autoimmune panel, other infectious diseases)
   - f/u add on serum and urine tox including ETOH level
   - SW consult
   .
   # Melena, GIB
   - continue to trend Hcts, trend hct>25 or active bleeding
   - favor EGD, will discuss with liver
   - continue PPI
   # Hepatobiliary CT findings: Found with pneumobilia, gallstones,
   dilated small bowel with transition point raising concern for
   hepatobiliary infectious process
   See discussion above
   .
   # Renal failure: Baseline Cr was 1.3 per records. Acute renal failure
   could be in setting of liver disease, urine lytes most consistent with
   ATN, but could be component of prerenal.
   - Renal following
   - f/u UCx, Ulytes
   - No indication for HD overnight but will follow if needed tomorrow AM
   - close followup of lytes
   .
   # Gout: Was on prednisone for gout. Also unclear if patient taking more
   tylenol/pain medications for gout which was component of altered mental
   status. On low dose prednisone at home
   - hold on any pain medications overnight
   - will continue steroids for now
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs s/p IVC filter [**12-18**] on coumadin. No evidence of hypoxia.
   - IV vitamin K to reverse INR
   .
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   - continue home seizure ppx therapy by IV dosing
   - no evidence of worsening CNS process on CT head
   .
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts consistent with flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)
   - watch for fluid overload

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and chronic renal failure. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, and new-onset acute fulminant liver failure. The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy and drainage of malodorous fluid. He was found to have encephalopathy, asterixis, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's coagulopathy improved with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. The assessment and plan include suspected biliary process causing liver failure, consideration for percutaneous biliary drain placement, continuation of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and evaluation for liver transplantation. Other concerns include melena, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatobiliary infectious process, renal failure, gout, history of pulmonary embolism, meningioma, and Wegeners.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure could progress to acute kidney injury if not managed appropriately.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of melena suggests the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a serious complication in critically ill patients.
4. Infection:"

   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice:  imaging c/w gallstone ileus, may have
   associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improving
   slowly . Initial concern for fulminant liver failure on presentation,
   but  less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated.
   Bandemia when arrived, concern for biliary sepsis
   - f/up IR re: drain function
   - f/up bile culture final
 cont Zosyn / Vanc
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   -- F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue gentle  fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs 8-10
   - goal net even if possible / esp given meningioma hx
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR : Per discussion with his partner this is a new issue
   for patient.  Most likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain.
   Currently he is back in NSR.
   .
   -follow tele closely
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 changed from 5mg q4 to
   q6 dosing
   - given transaminitis will hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today, appears more awake today  and has + gag
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - f/up GI recs
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q8 HCts for now , transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status:
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia given Cr 1.2 to >4 range
 also
   considered hepatic encephalopathy. No evidence of seizure activity. CT
   head with 2mm hyperdensity stable on serial imaging, not clearly a
   bleed, unlikely contributory to the current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q6h neuro checks
   - f/up neurosurgery recommendations
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   .
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra & dilantin
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now w/Solumedrol
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners. Renal feels this is not ARF
   related to Wegeners now.  Possibly pre-renal evolving to ATN.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and no known history of active liver disease. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, and transaminitis. Imaging showed gallstone ileus, which was treated with percutaneous cholecystotomy. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and required pressors. He also has a history of gout, Wegeners, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). The patient is intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation. He has renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), coagulopathy, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent hypotension and bandemia suggest a potential sepsis, particularly in the setting of biliary sepsis due to gallstone ileus.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may progress to AKI due to ongoing hypotension, coagulopathy, and potential infection.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's melena on admission indicates possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which should be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and presence of melena suggest a coagulopathy that needs to be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and no known history of active liver disease. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, and transaminitis. The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystotomy by interventional radiology (IR) and drainage of malodorous fluid. He also received metoprolol for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated respiratory rate. His laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury (ATN) with an elevated serum creatinine level of 6.1 mg/dL and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There is evidence of liver dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and coagulopathy. Imaging studies reveal multiple findings including a large stone in the gallbladder, air in the common duct, and diffuse dilation of fluid-filled proximal small bowel. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation with pressures support ventilation (PSV) mode. He has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving IV fluids, blood products, and medications including antibiotics, analgesics, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)
   - watch for fluid overload

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and no known history of active liver disease. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and was found to have encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. 

The patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystotomy by interventional radiology (IR) with drainage of malodorous fluid. He was also started on metoprolol for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/64 mmHg to 131/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 6,861 mL and a total output of 5,150 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,711 mL. 

The patient is intubated for airway protection and is on mechanical ventilation (CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode) with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 20 cmH2O, and plateau pressure at 16 cmH2O. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, liver enzymes (AST, ALT), total bilirubin, amylase, lipase, and lactate. Blood cultures are pending. 

Imaging studies reveal a large stone in the gallbladder, air in the common duct and gallbladder neck, suggesting a possible biliary-enteric fistula. There is also diffuse dilation of fluid-filled proximal small bowel up to nearly 4 cm, with relative collapse of the TI and distal ileum, indicating early or partial small bowel obstruction (SBO). No definite transition point is identified. 

The patient's assessment and plan include suspected gallstone ileus with associated biliary infection, concern for fulminant liver failure, potential sepsis, hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR), vent weaning, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, gout, history of Wegeners, history of pulmonary embolism, and aortic stenosis. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and communication with the interdisciplinary team. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M history of wegener's with baseline creatinine 1.2, PE [**11-17**],
   stable meningioma, AS with [**Location (un) 549**] 1, gout, who presented with altered
   mental status and was found to have new liver failure
   1.)  Biliary obstruction/Sepsis: Now s/p perc drain.
     -Follow up cultures from drain.
     -Continue empiric Zosyn, Vanc.   Will wait for final cultures to
   tailor abx.
     -Still on neosynephrine (not levophed given AF with RVR).  Will wean
   as biliary tree is drained.
     -CVP adequate now
     -Surgery on board
   2.)  Renal Failure:  Sediment c/w ATN in setting of sepsis.  U/o and
   Creatine both improving.
     -Continue to monitor u/o, lyes during post-ATN diuresis
   3.)  Coagulopathy: Anticoagulated for h/o PE in [**11-17**].  INR responded
   vigorously to Vitamin K.
     -If no new bleeding, will restart coumadin soon.
   4.) AF with RVR:  Currently in sinus.
     -PRN rate control with low dose BB vs amio if persistent problem.
   5.)  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated originally for airway protection.
   Minimal secretions
     -PSV trial today.
    6. Gout: Apparently on chronic prednisone 40mg daily.  Unclear if all
   for gout or in part for WG.
    - Currently on solumedrol for absorption issues.
    7. GIB: No signs of GIB since melena on initial presentation.
   -Check Q8hr HCT for now.  If rebleeds, may need EGD
   Rest of plan per resident note.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M history of wegener's with baseline creatinine 1.2, PE [**11-17**],
   stable meningioma, AS with [**Location (un) 549**] 1, gout, who presented with altered
   mental status and was found to have new liver failure
   1.)  Biliary obstruction/Sepsis: Now s/p perc drain.
     -Follow up cultures from drain.
     -Continue empiric Zosyn, Vanc.   Will wait for final cultures to
   tailor abx.
     -Still on neosynephrine (not levophed given AF with RVR).  Will wean
   as biliary tree is drained.
     -CVP adequate now
     -Surgery on board
   2.)  Renal Failure:  Sediment c/w ATN in setting of sepsis.  U/o and
   Creatine both improving.
     -Continue to monitor u/o, lyes during post-ATN diuresis
   3.)  Coagulopathy: Anticoagulated for h/o PE in [**11-17**].  INR responded
   vigorously to Vitamin K.
     -If no new bleeding, will restart coumadin soon.
   4.) AF with RVR:  Currently in sinus.
     -PRN rate control with low dose BB vs amio if persistent problem.
   5.)  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated originally for airway protection.
   Minimal secretions
     -PSV trial today.
    6. Gout: Apparently on chronic prednisone 40mg daily.  Unclear if all
   for gout or in part for WG.
    - Currently on solumedrol for absorption issues.
    7. GIB: No signs of GIB since melena on initial presentation.
   -Check Q8hr HCT for now.  If rebleeds, may need EGD
   Rest of plan per resident note.

   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q4h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   .
   # AS: From OSH records, patient with mild aortic valve stenosis: [**Location (un) 549**]
   1.07 cm2 on TTE [**12-18**]. Patient on lasix (unclear if with documented
   failure)

   Assessment and Plan
   62M meningioma, Wegeners, prior PE without known h/o active liver
   disease presenting to ED with 1 day altered mental status found to have
   encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # Transaminitis and jaundice
   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus, may have associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili improved
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams, follow biliary drain output
 will ask IR to
   check as output trailed off since drain placement
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function q6h for now
   - Continue fentanyl as needed for abdominal pain
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for now for question of biliary sepsis
   pending cultures
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Hypotension
   Remained on pressors overnight. Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative
   hypovolemia in setting of post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider
   also afib/RVR, meds (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic
   steroids at home, consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   - Check lactate, central venous O2
   - Await repeat TTE here
   - If difficulty weaning pressors despite volume consider stress dose
   steroids though would prefer to limit steroids given concern for GIB
   and possible infection. Checking cortisol complicated by current
   methylprednisolone tx.
   #Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
 with transaminitis will
   hold on amiodarone.
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - Repeat TTE here
   # Vent
   Intubated for airway protection yesterday
   - Wean to PSV today
   - Recheck gas this morning
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI yesterday held on EGD given absence of large
   bleeding
   - Continue PPI drip
   - Follow q6h hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # Altered mental status
   Suspect this is [**3-13**] to uremia
 also considered hepatic encephalopathy.
   No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm hyperdensity stable
   on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely contributory to the
   current presentation.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Transaminitis and jaundice: The patient presents with elevated liver enzymes and jaundice, suggesting possible liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency. It is important to continue fluid boluses, monitor urine output, and check lactate and central venous O2 levels.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has evidence of acute kidney injury on top of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has melena, which indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The cause needs to be investigated further, and appropriate measures should be taken to control the bleeding.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR, suggesting impaired blood clotting. Vitamin K administration has improved the INR, but close monitoring and active transfusion support may be required.

6. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion could be attributed to uremia or hepatic encephalopathy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and guide management.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which should be corrected carefully to avoid rapid changes in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and chronic renal failure. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystotomy and has shown improvement in liver function tests and bilirubin levels. However, he continues to have hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and requires pressors. There are concerns about sepsis, relative hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, and coagulopathy. The patient is also at risk for hypernatremia, gout, Wegeners flare, pulmonary embolism, and aortic stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and requirement for pressors suggest the possibility of sepsis. The presence of GNRs in blood cultures also supports this concern. Monitoring vital signs, maintaining adequate fluid balance, and ensuring appropriate antibiotic coverage are crucial.

2. Relative Hypovolemia: The patient's ongoing hypotension and need for pressors indicate possible relative hypovolemia. Close monitoring of fluid balance and urine output is important. If necessary, fluid boluses should be administered to target CVPs above 10.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's chronic steroid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, and prior pulmonary embolism presenting to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was found to have encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy for biliary infection and was found to have gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. He also has a history of gout, Wegeners, and mild aortic valve stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction.
2. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and the presence of ATN should be considered.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and potential bacteremia indicate a possible septic state.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and should be monitored for signs of recurrent PE, especially considering his immobilization.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has melena, which suggests a potential GIB, especially in the setting of coagulopathy.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and careful monitoring and management are required.
7. Atrial fibrillation (Af"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, aortic stenosis, gout, and altered mental status. The patient presented with new liver failure and was found to have biliary obstruction/sepsis. He underwent a percutaneous drain placement and now has a gram-negative rod (GNR) infection in his blood. The patient also has renal failure, coagulopathy, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, respiratory failure, gout, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biliary obstruction/sepsis: The patient has a GNR infection in his blood, which could lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
2. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys are still recovering from acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and there is a need for ongoing monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient is anticoagulated due to his history of pulmonary embolism. However, the INR responded vigorously to Vitamin K, and if no new bleeding occurs, the patient can restart coumadin tomorrow.
4. AF with RVR: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but he will continue with an amiodarone load for now. This will hopefully settle down as the acute illness improves.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, stable meningioma, atrial septal defect, gout, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with altered mental status and was found to have new liver failure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Biliary obstruction/sepsis: The patient has undergone percutaneous drainage and is now showing signs of GNR (gram-negative rods) in the blood. Follow-up cultures from the drain should be done, and empiric antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin) should be continued until final cultures are available. Daily surveillance cultures, discontinuation of pressors, and surgical intervention should also be considered.

2. Renal failure: The patient has sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis. Urea and creatinine levels are improving. Monitoring urine output and electrolytes during post-ATN diuresis, as well as targeting blood glucose levels, should be continued.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient is anticoagulated for a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). The INR responded vigorously to Vitamin K. If no new bleeding occurs, restarting coumadin tomorrow should be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, and pulmonary embolism presenting with altered mental status, encephalopathy, jaundice, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal failure, and sepsis. He underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy for biliary infection and found to have GNR bacteremia. The patient completed a course of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and initiated extensive pre-transplant workup. He is currently on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and sinus tachycardia, which has not responded to metoprolol and digoxin. The patient is also on pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and piperacillin/tazobactam for infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Transaminitis and jaundice: These symptoms suggest possible liver dysfunction or damage. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels is necessary.
3. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings indicate a potential infection leading to sepsis. Continued antibiotic therapy and careful monitoring for signs of infection are crucial.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism (PE), and chronic renal failure. The patient presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, and transaminitis. He underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy for biliary infection and was found to have gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Transaminitis and jaundice: The patient is suspected to have gallstone ileus and associated biliary infection. He has undergone percutaneous cholecystotomy and his liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels continue to improve.

2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR): The patient has not had this previously and it is most likely precipitated by acute illness and pain. He is now on amiodarone and his heart rate is better controlled.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR improved following vitamin K administration. He is advised to continue holding warfarin and to trend INR and maintain active thromboprophylaxis.

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient had melena on admission in the setting of coagulopathy. It is planned to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) when stabilized"

   CXR [**5-27**]
   Right infrahilar consolidation has been present since at least [**5-24**]. On
   the left, a less severe region of presumed atelectasis has slowly
   progressed.
   Lung volumes remain quite low. Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal.
   With
   the chin down, tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 2 cm from the
   carina
   is still acceptable. Right jugular line ends at the superior cavoatrial
   junction. No pneumothorax.
   [**5-26**] TTE
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Suspect [**3-13**] gallstone ileus and associated biliary infection
   Now s/p percutaneous cholecystotomy by IR with LFTs, bili continues to
   improve
   Had been concerned for fulminant liver failure on presentation, but
   less likely given rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. Patient
   completed course of NAC and extensive pre-transplant workup initiated
   - Surgery, IR, liver recs appreciated
   - Serial abdominal exams Q4hr, follow biliary drain output
   - Discuss fistulogram with surgery, GI
   - Trend LFTs and synthetic function daily
   - Continue fentanyl boluses as needed for abdominal pain
   - Can DC vancomycin, may change Zosyn to cipro to complete 7d course
   abx (D1=[**5-24**])
   - F/u pretransplant serologic workup
   # Paroxysmal Afib with RVR
   Per discussion with partner, patient has not had this previously. Most
   likely precipitated by his acute illness, pain. Now on amiodarone HR
   better controlled overnight, in SR this morning.
   - Continue amiodarone gtt s/p load
   - Can trial metoprolol or dilt prn
   - Pain control
   - No anticoagulation for now given bleeding, coagulopathy
   - f/u TSH
   # Coagulopathy
   INR improved following vitamin K.
   - Continue to hold warfarin
   - Trend INR, maintain active T+S
   # GIB
   Patient had melena on admission in setting of coagulopathy. Per
   discussion with GI, held on EGD given absence of large bleeding. Hct
   has been stable overnight.
   - Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse hct>25
   - Favor EGD when stabilized
   # h/o PE: Pulmonary Embolism with RH strain dx [**11/2158**] with bilateral
   DVTs
   - continuing to hold anticoagulation for now, has IVC filter
   # Hypotension: Patient off pressors now.
   Suspect [**3-13**] sepsis along with relative hypovolemia in setting of
   post-ATN diuresis and blood loss. Consider also afib/RVR, meds
   (metoprolol, propofol). In setting of chronic steroids at home,
   consider also adrenal insufficiency
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed targeting CVPs >10
   - Follow urine output, goal at least net even today
   # Altered mental status
   Now significantly improved. Consideratiosn included uremia,  hepatic
   encephalopathy. No evidence of seizure activity. CT head with 2mm
   hyperdensity stable on serial imaging, not clearly a bleed, unlikely
   contributory to the current presentation.
   - Wean sedation for q6h neuro checks
   - Neurosurgery recommendations appreciated
   - Renal failure improving, holding on HD at this time
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
   Felt most c/w ATN by renal. Good urine output, likely post-ATN
   diuresis. No indication for HD at this time
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow urine output closely given potential for volume depletion,
   goal even as discussed above
   # Meningioma and h/o seizures
   Scans reviewed by neurosurgery, felt no bleeding or significant acute
   process. No need for bolt.
   - continue keppra
   - run close to even
   - neurosurgery recs appreciated
   # Hypernatremia
   - Check PM lytes
   - Check free water deficit, replete conservatively
   # Gout:
   - will continue steroids for now
 change to PO prednisone today
   # h/o Wegeners: No evidence of white cell casts, acanthocytes, red cell
   casts that would suggest flare of Wegeners
   - renal following, appreciate recs

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of meningioma, Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and chronic renal failure. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, transaminitis, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy for biliary infection and was found to have GNR bacteremia. 

The patient's conditions include transaminitis and jaundice, which are improving after the cholecystostomy. There is also concern for fulminant liver failure, but this is less likely given the rapid improvement in INR with vitamin K. The patient has completed a course of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and an extensive pre-transplant workup has been initiated.

The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFR) and is now on amiodarone, which has helped to control his heart rate. He is also being monitored for coagulopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient had melena on admission in the setting of coagulopathy, but no large bleeding was observed. His hemoglobin (Hct) has been stable overnight.

The patient's medical history includes a pulmonary embolism with right heart strain diagnosed in 11/2018, along with bilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs). He currently has an inferior"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegeners, prior pulmonary embolism, and chronic renal failure. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, jaundice, and transaminitis. He was found to have GNR bacteremia and biliary infection. The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy and has shown improvement in liver function tests and biliary output. He is currently on antibiotics and will complete a 7-day course. The patient also has a history of gout, seizures, and a meningioma. He is on chronic steroids and has had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's conditions include acute on chronic renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy, and hypotension. He is currently off pressors and is being monitored for fluid balance and urine output. The patient's mental status has significantly improved, and there is no evidence of seizure activity. His renal failure is improving, and he is not indicated for hemodialysis at this time. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Liver failure: The patient's jaundice and transaminitis indicate possible liver dysfunction. Close monitoring of liver function tests is necessary to assess for any further decline in liver function.
2. Biliary infection: The presence of GNR bacteremia and biliary infection increases the risk of complications such as sepsis or abscess formation. Continuous monitoring of"

Vital signs are stable, with a CVP of 5 mmHg, total input of 4,141 mL, and total output of 4,660 mL. The patient has a history of meningioma and Wegeners, and his labs show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals right infrahilar consolidation and left atelectasis on chest X-ray, as well as moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and mild aortic valve stenosis on transthoracic echocardiogram. Microbiology shows heavy growth of E. coli and Serratia in bile culture. The patient's plan includes continuing ciprofloxacin for 7 days, weaning off sedation for neuro checks"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegener's disease, gout, who presented with acute liver failure in the setting of cholecystitis. He was successfully extubated and his mental status is improving. The patient has allergies to Lisinopril and angioedema. He received antibiotics including Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. He is currently on various medications such as Pantoprazole, other ICU medications, and changes to his medical and family history.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain and right upper quadrant discomfort. The flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal limits, with a slight elevation in heart rate. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 8 mmHg, with an adequate fluid balance. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%. 

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular issues, as pulses in both radial and digital arteries could not be assessed. Neurologic examination was also not assessed due to the patient's altered mental status. Skin and other systems were not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count. Kidney function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels. Liver enzymes are elevated, and there is evidence of jaundice. Electrolytes show normal sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. Glucose levels are within normal range."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Wegeners, gout, presenting with acute liver failure in the setting of cholecystitis. He has been extubated successfully, and his mental status is improving. The patient has allergies to Lisinopril and angioedema. He has been receiving various antibiotics and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
