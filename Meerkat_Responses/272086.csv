   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 51 y/o M with stiff person syndome here with fevers, likely
   from HAP vs Aspiration PNA and possible sepsis.
   Fever/PNA/Leukocytosis: CXR shows RML/RLL PNA. HAP vs aspiration. He
   was just advanced to regular diet earlier this week, so aspiration is
   possibility; patient also has poor cough reflex, making it difficult to
   clear secretions, etc. Patient hypotensive to 80's-90s in the ED Per
   last discharge summary, his baseline 80-110s, considering septic
   picture. Also keeping in mind Drug withdrawal considering he is on
   chronic narcotics and benzos.
   - Broad coverage for HAP with [**Doctor Last Name **]/Zosyn for now
   - improving on this so will hold off double covering gram negatives
   - Sputum culture -- although at this point he will have been on abx for
   several days
   - stool for C diff
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   - Will try to wake up patient if hpyotensive, if that doesn
t work can
   bolus him
    Hypotension: per last discharge summary, baseline is systolics 80-110.
   Per HCP report, SBPs have been 110-120s. got 5L NS in the ED, was 120s
   on arrival to floor. Considering sepsis, hypovolemia, autonomic
   dysfunction. Patient has been normal tensive for >24 hours. He did not
   require a bolus yesterday. CVPs have been low, but patient is making
   vigorous urine all throughout hospitalization, indicating that
   hypotension is likely autonomic and not from sepsis
   - wake up vs bolus NS for hypotension
   Bradycardia: Patient had 2 episodes of bradycardia, one in the ED, one
   upon arriving the the ICU. Autonomic instabilty is symptom of stiffman,
   so this may be a function of that. These episodes resolved on their
   own. Patient asymptomatic.
   - Atropine at bedside
   - monitor for now
   - would consider pacing or temp wire, but patient is DNR/DNI
    Stiff Person Syndrome: Patient denies current exacerbation, can move
   extremities. Home dose oxycontin 160mg AM and 200mg PM.
   - Dilauded PCA, cannot take POs right now. Per Neurology tends to
   become somnelent with too much narcotics. Will switch to when
   tolerating POS
   - Dizepam 20mg every 4 hours
   - let Movement Disorders Neuro input appreciated
   - Pain consult appreciated: Dilauded PCA
    DVT: diagnosed [**10-3**]. On coumadin. Considered PE, INR 4.2. Resolving
   DVT on u/s
   - will hold coumadin today. INR high in setting of antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with stiff person syndrome who presented with fevers, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, and possible sepsis. The patient's baseline blood pressure is systolic 80-110. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for HAP, but there are concerns about drug withdrawal given his chronic narcotics and benzodiazepines use. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen with a target SpO2 of 99%. He is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a nasogastric (NG) tube in place. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture (not yet sent) are all negative. His vital signs show a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 87/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of respiratory distress or abnormal breath sounds. He is alert, oriented to time, place, and person, and follows simple commands. The patient has a rash on his abdomen, chest, and face, which could be due to contact dermatitis, stiff person syndrome, or drug rash. His extremities are warm and well-perfused. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count."

He is anemic with a hematocrit level of 29%, which is his baseline. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires tube feeding recommendations. He does not feel comfortable eating at the moment. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and a healthcare proxy. He is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of stiff person syndrome, currently admitted to the ICU for fevers, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, as well as possible sepsis. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for HAP and his blood cultures and urine culture are negative. The patient's baseline blood pressure is 80-110s, and he has experienced episodes of hypotension and bradycardia, which have resolved on their own. He has been receiving intravenous fluids and is being monitored for sepsis. The patient is also on chronic narcotics and benzodiazepines, leading to concerns about drug withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the lower range, and he has experienced episodes of hypotension. Further monitoring and management are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has had two episodes of bradycardia, which could be related to autonomic instability associated with stiff person syndrome or sepsis. Close monitoring and the availability of atropine for symptomatic management are recommended.
3. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation suggests the possibility of sepsis, which requires ongoing monitoring of vital signs, regular assessment of blood cultures, and appropriate management of fluid and electrolyte balance.
4. Drug Withdrawal: Given the patient's chronic use of"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of stiff person syndrome, who presented with fevers, likely due to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia, and possible sepsis. The patient was hypotensive in the emergency department and had a baseline blood pressure of 80-110 systolic. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for HAP and also tested for C. difficile in his stool. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and a sputum culture has not been sent.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), a heart rate of 57 bpm, a blood pressure of 87/46 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented to time, place, and person, but has a poor cough reflex and rhonchi bilaterally on lung auscultation. His abdominal exam is notable for muscle wasting, and he is unable to stand. The patient has a rash on his abdomen, chest, and face.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, a platelet count of 168 K/uL, and a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient"
