","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with a medical history of ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CRI). The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently hemodynamically stable. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.5°F)
- Heart rate: 87 bpm (normal range: 70-96 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 91/43 mmHg (low blood pressure)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (normal range: 16-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL (low)
- Hematocrit: 20.2% (low)
- Platelets: 191,000/mm³ (slightly low)
- Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL (elevated)
- Glucose: 238 mg/dL (elevated)
- White blood cell count: 18.1/mm³ (elevated)
- Leukocytosis with normal differential

The patient's physical examination revealed conjunctival pallor, a systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border, distended abdomen with fluid waves, and 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema.

The patient's assessment includes several issues:
1. GI bleed: The patient has known ulcerative colitis and a friable lesion found during sigmoidoscopy, which is most likely causing the gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's hematocrit dropped significantly, but they are currently hemodynamically stable. The plan is to transfuse 2 units of packed red blood cells, trend hematocrit, monitor for hemodynamic stability, administer intravenous corticosteroids, and continue mesalamine.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis due to NASH with increasing ascites and baseline coagulopathy. The liver team is aware of the situation and recommends continuing ursodeoxycholic acid.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, likely secondary to GIB. They have required transfusions in the past. The plan is the same as for acute GIB.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a normal differential. They are afebrile and have no abdominal tenderness. Their lactate level is mildly elevated, and lipase is mildly elevated as well. These changes are likely due to an ulcerative colitis flare. Clostridium difficile will be considered on the differential. No other signs or symptoms of infection are present. Chest X-ray is normal, and there are"

   Assessment and Plan
   # GI bleed: The patient has known ulcerative colitis and was finishing
   a prednisone burst taper when his bleeding began.  Bleeding is most
   likely secondary to the friable lesion found on flex sigmoidoscopy on
   [**11-22**].  He has remained hemodynamically stable despite a significant
   hematocrit drop.  He had 3 episodes of BRBPR on [**11-29**], each with about
   50 cc of blood.   He has now received 6 units of PRBCs since
   admission.  Poor hematocrit response likely secondary to
   dehydration/volume contraction on admission and continued bleeding.
   Hepatology scoped patient in unit this morning: evidence of portal
   hypertensive gastropathy and previous attempts at cautery.  Patient
   needs TIPS to decompress venous congestion.  Will plan for procedure on
   [**12-2**] unless patient begins to bleed acutely and become HD unstable in
   the interim and requires urgent TIPS.  No evidence of active UC.  A
   villous adenoma was seen in the colon, but will wait to ressect until
   after TIPS.
   - will check post-transfusion hct; if <27, transfuse again & recheck
   hct; if >27 will recheck hct in 6 hours.
   - monitor on telemetry for hemodynamic stability.
   - solumedrol can be quickly tapered off

   # Thrombocytopenia: Baseline is 50-70s, likely secondary to
   NASH/cirrhosis/splenomegaly.  Drop is likely secondary to dehydration
   on admission and volume resuscitation with blood products.  Will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # Leukocytosis with normal diff: Patient afebrile.  No abdominal
   tenderness.  Lactate down to 1.9 by yesterday afternoon.  Lipase down
   to 32.  C. diff negative.  Additional stool studies, blood, & urine
   cultures still pending.  These changes are most likely due to

","The patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with known ulcerative colitis and cirrhosis, presenting to the ICU with GI bleeding. The patient has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for ongoing bleeding and significant hematocrit drop. He has been hemodynamically stable despite the blood loss. A flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed a friable lesion, which is likely the cause of the bleeding. The patient also has evidence of portal hypertensive gastropathy and previous attempts at cautery. He is planned for a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure on [**12-2**] unless he experiences an acute bleeding episode and becomes hemodynamically unstable, requiring an urgent TIPS. A villous adenoma was seen in the colon, but will be addressed after the TIPS procedure. 

The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to an ulcerative colitis flare and volume contraction. His thrombocytopenia is secondary to NASH/cirrhosis/splenomegaly, and his anemia is most likely caused by gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's baseline mid to low 30s hemoglobin level indicates chronic blood loss. 

The patient's renal function is currently normal, but he has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and cirrhosis. He requires close monitoring of his creatinine levels and avoidance of nephroto"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and a recent diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, resulting in substantial transfusion requirements. The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level has been stabilized at 21 in the past 24 hours, despite receiving 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). There is no evidence of upper GI blood loss.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with lower GI bleed, which is causing hematochezia and bloody bowel movement per rectum (BRBPR). He has diabetes mellitus type I, leukocytosis, and cirrhosis associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The patient is also diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.

Given the continued need for transfusion, an early intervention with colonoscopy will be considered. Other co-existing conditions, such as cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis, will require treatment as well.

Medications:
The patient is currently receiving solumedrol, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), ursodiol, and ciprofloxacin/flagyl for possible infection in the setting of a flare of ulcerative colitis.

ICU Care:
The patient is receiving IV fluids due to his nil per os (npo) status, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and has two central lines inserted."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   # GI bleed: The patient has known ulcerative colitis and was finishing
   a prednisone burst taper when his bleeding began.  Bleeding is most
   likely secondary to the friable lesion found on flex sigmoidoscopy on
   [**11-22**].  He has remained hemodynamically stable despite a significant
   hematocrit drop.  He had 3 episodes of BRBPR on [**11-29**], each with about
   50 cc of blood.   He has now received 6 units of PRBCs since
   admission.  Poor hematocrit response likely secondary to
   dehydration/volume contraction on admission and continued bleeding.
   Hepatology scoped patient in unit this morning: evidence of portal
   hypertensive gastropathy and previous attempts at cautery.  Patient
   needs TIPS to decompress venous congestion.  Will plan for procedure on
   [**12-2**] unless patient begins to bleed acutely and become HD unstable in
   the interim and requires urgent TIPS.  No evidence of active UC.  A
   villous adenoma was seen in the colon, but will wait to ressect until
   after TIPS.
   - will check post-transfusion hct; if <27, transfuse again & recheck
   hct; if >27 will recheck hct in 6 hours.
   - monitor on telemetry for hemodynamic stability.
   - solumedrol can be quickly tapered off
   - continue mesalamine
   - continue flagyl/cipro
   - hepatology following
   .
   # Cirrhosis [**2-3**] NASH:  Has increasing ascities.  Baseline coagulopathy.
   - Liver team is aware, appreciate recommendations.
   - continue ursodial
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline mid to low 30s.  Last HCT on [**11-12**] was 32.2.  ?
   secondary to GIB.  Needed transfusions in the past.  No known CHF.
   - plan as above for acute GIB.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Baseline is 50-70s, likely secondary to
   NASH/cirrhosis/splenomegaly.  Drop is likely secondary to dehydration
   on admission and volume resuscitation with blood products.  Will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # Leukocytosis with normal diff: Patient afebrile.  No abdominal
   tenderness.  Lactate down to 1.9 by yesterday afternoon.  Lipase down
   to 32.  C. diff negative.  Additional stool studies, blood, & urine
   cultures still pending.  These changes are most likely due to
   ulcerative colitis flare as well as volume contraction as mentioned
   above.
   - f/u blood & urine cultures
   - f/u stool studies
   - cont. ciprofloxacin and flagyl for possible GI infection
   - Diagnostic perotoneal tap if abdominal exam changes per liver recs
   .
   # CRI: BL Cr 1.8-2.1.  Currently at BL.  Unclear etiology but have DM
   2, HTN and cirrhosis.
   - Trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 73-inch individual with a medical history of ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a recent colonoscopy that revealed diffuse bleeding. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being managed for several medical complications.

1. GI Bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which is likely secondary to a friable lesion found during sigmoidoscopy. The bleeding episodes have resulted in a significant drop in hematocrit levels, but the patient remains hemodynamically stable. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission. Due to continued bleeding and portal hypertensive gastropathy, the patient is planned for a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure on December 2nd unless there is an acute bleeding episode that requires urgent TIPS.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, likely due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This is evidenced by increasing ascites and baseline coagulopathy. The liver team is aware of these findings, and ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodial) is being continued.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is most likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. The last hematocrit (HCT) reading on November 12th was 32."

   NASH/cirrhosis/splenomegaly.  Drop is likely secondary to dehydration
   on admission and volume resuscitation with blood products.  If actively
   bleeding again would Tx platelets.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-inch individual with a chief complaint of diffuse bleeding after undergoing a colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. The bleeding is likely due to ulcerative colitis (UC) and exacerbated by portal hypertension. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 26.6 to 22.9 after the bleeding episode. Urgent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement was recommended if there are further bleeding episodes.

The patient also has a history of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis, which has led to increasing ascites, baseline coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 50-70s. The thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to NASH/cirrhosis/splenomegaly. The patient received blood products for volume resuscitation, leading to an increase in platelet count. If there is active bleeding again, platelet transfusion will be considered.

The patient has chronic kidney injury (CRI) with baseline creatinine levels of 1.8-2.1, currently at baseline. The etiology of CRI is unclear but may be related to diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension, and cirrhosis. The patient's DM2 was last assessed with an HbA1c of 7.1, and finger stick glucose levels have been elevated. Close monitoring of kidney function and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.

The patient is currently nil per os (NPO), meaning they are not receiving any oral intake. Intravenous fluids (IVF) will be considered later in the day if the patient is not receiving further blood products. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been prescribed for peptic ulcer disease (PPx).

Overall, the patient's medical complications include GI bleeding likely due to UC and exacerbated by portal hypertension, NASH-related cirrhosis with associated complications such as ascites, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia, CRI with an unclear etiology, and DM2. Urgent TIPS placement and platelet transfusion may be required for managing the GI bleeding and thrombocytopenia. Close monitoring of kidney function and avoidance of nephrotoxins are necessary for managing CRI."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted with bright red blood per rectum. He has experienced ongoing blood loss and has undergone sigmoidoscopy, which suggests that the bleeding is likely a consequence of portal hypertension. The patient has required transfusion over the past 24 hours but has not shown significant hemodynamic compromise. He is currently stable and has clear and reasonable questions regarding the risks and benefits of the planned procedure, TIPSS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating a decline in kidney function. This could be due to hypoperfusion or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
2. Type I Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, indicating poor glycemic control. This could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Lower: The patient initially presented with bright red blood per rectum, suggesting lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further bleeding.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending down since admission, which may indicate splenic sequestration in the setting of portal hypertension. Monitoring for platelet count below 30,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and cirrhosis admitted for bloody bowel movements. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including steroids, octreotide, insulin, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/58 to 134/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support. Physical examination reveals mild jaundice, distended abdomen with positive fluid wave, and 2+ pitting edema to the mid-tibia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly low platelet count, increased creatinine level, and elevated glucose levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates an elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, with an INR of 1.9. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including gastrointestinal bleeding likely caused by ulcerative colitis and exacerbated by portal hypertension, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, chronic renal insufficiency, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently on hold for a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure, which requires a platelet count above 50,"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and cirrhosis. He was admitted for several bloody bowel movements. He underwent a TIPS procedure yesterday, which involved the placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to relieve portal hypertension. The patient also has ascites and coagulopathy. He has thrombocytopenia with a baseline platelet count of 50-70s, likely secondary to NASH/cirrhosis/splenomegaly. His creatinine levels are within baseline range. He has diabetes mellitus type 2 with an elevated HbA1c level of 7.1. He is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) for the procedure and will need reassessment of his nutrition status post-procedure. He is on multivitamins and has a code status of full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and cirrhosis. He was admitted for bloody bowel movements, which were likely caused by UC and exacerbated by portal hypertension. The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure due to portal vein clot and removal of 3 liters of ascites fluid. After the procedure, his hematocrit (HCT) dropped from 27.2 to 22.2, and then to 21.5, suggesting dilutional effect. The patient is no longer experiencing bloody bowel movements or abdominal pain, suggesting no subcapsular bleed. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI bleed: The patient likely had a bleeding episode due to UC, which was worsened by portal hypertension. The TIPS procedure has been performed, and the patient is showing improvement.
2. Liver: The patient's liver is no longer suspected to have a flare-up of UC, and the patient has completed a course of steroids.
3. Cirrhosis [2-3] NASH: The patient has cirrhosis with ascites and coagulopathy. Follow-up liver recommendations include f/u liver tests, continuing on mesalamine and ursodiol.
4. SOB: The patient's oxygen requirement has increased after TIPS and 3L IVF. A chest X-ray shows increased pulmonary vascular congestion. Neb"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 64-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and cirrhosis, was admitted for several bloody bowel movements. The patient likely had a gastrointestinal bleed caused by ulcerative colitis and exacerbated by portal hypertension. However, he is no longer experiencing bloody bowel movements. During the TIPS procedure, a large clot in the portal vein was found and 3 liters of ascites fluid were removed. The patient received 25g albumin and 3 liters of intravenous fluids. After the procedure, the patient's hematocrit (HCT) dropped from 27.2 to 22.2, which was believed to be dilutional. There were no further bloody bowel movements or abdominal pain suggesting a subcapsular bleed.

1. GI bleed: The patient had a likely bleeding caused by UC and exacerbated by portal hypertension. However, he is no longer having bloody bowel movements. The liver is no longer suspecting UC flare, and the patient has finished steroids. The patient does not have UGI bleed in need of prophylaxis, so he does not require ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. The interventional radiology (IR) recommends considering US abdomen to access for subcapsular bleed if HCT does not stabilize. The patient should follow up with liver recommendations, continue on mesalamine and ursodiol, and stop octreotide post-procedure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis and cirrhosis. He was admitted for several bloody bowel movements, and it is likely that the bleeding started from ulcerative colitis and was exacerbated by portal hypertension. The patient is no longer experiencing bloody bowel movements, and his hematocrit levels have remained stable.

The patient's liver condition suggests that he would benefit from a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. To prepare for this procedure, the patient will receive fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to correct his coagulopathy, with the goal of having an INR less than 1.5 before the procedure.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to NASH/cirrhosis/splenomegaly. His platelet count is currently above 50, which meets the requirement for TIPS. The plan is to continue monitoring the platelet count and treat if more bleeding occurs.

Other medical issues include chronic kidney disease (CKD) with baseline creatinine levels of 1.8-2.1, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) with elevated finger sticks, and malnutrition due to being nil per os (NPO) for a couple of days. The patient is on multivitamins and will need reassessment of his nutrition status post-procedure and when feeding can be started.

The patient is currently on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His code status is full code, and his disposition is pending the TIPS procedure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis who underwent a TIPS procedure yesterday for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He also had a paracentesis performed by interventional radiology. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 27% to 21% after the procedures, despite receiving albumin and multiple fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 137/63 mmHg and a heart rate of 76 bpm. He is on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no signs of distress. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The patient has mild peripheral edema in his extremities.

Potential Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, indicating that renal failure has not occurred.

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, and possibly a history of ulcerative colitis (UC). The patient presented to the hospital with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which was likely exacerbated by portal hypertension. He underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and was found to have a portal vein clot that was not seen on ultrasound. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 128/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with mild jaundice noted on physical examination. He has a distended abdomen with positive fluid wave, indicating ascites. There is also decreased pitting edema compared to yesterday. Peripheral pulses are symmetric and intact.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Liver enzymes are elevated, with AST and ALT levels at 185 and 42 U/L, respectively. The patient's serum creatinine is at the baseline range of 1.8-2.1 mg/dL. Electrolyte imbalances include hy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-inch tall individual with a history of renal failure, diabetes mellitus type I, leukocytosis, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 128/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is conscious and alert, with mild icterus and no murmurs. Lung examination reveals expiratory rhonchi, and abdominal examination shows distension with a positive fluid wave. There is also 2+ pitting edema and symmetric peripheral pulses. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and leukocytes, along with decreased platelet count. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions, IV fluids, antibiotics, and other medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of renal failure suggest a potential worsening of kidney function. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and urine output is crucial.

2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly stated, the patient's elevated glucose levels may indicate uncontrolled diabetes. DKA is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis. It requires immediate medical intervention.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed and presence of nonbloody vomit suggest ongoing bleeding. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and stool/black tarry output is essential.

4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an immune response or infection. It could be related to the patient's recent antibiotic use or another underlying cause. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of infection.

5. Fluid overload: The patient's increased edema and fluid balance indicate potential fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema, hypertension, and heart failure. Careful monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary.

6. Hyperglycemia: The consistently high glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control. Insulin therapy and close monitoring of blood glucose levels are required to prevent further complications.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The decreasing platelet count may suggest platelet consumption or sepsis-induced coagulopathy. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and considering platelet transfusion if necessary.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information may be needed for a more accurate assessment."

   A/P: 64 y/o man with h/o cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis w/lower GI
   bleed now 2d s/p TIPS procedure.
   # GI bleed: Known Ulcerrative colitis. Had multiple oozing lesions on
   sigmoidoscopy and it was thought that his oozing would not stop until
   his portal HTN was relieved. His Hct was 17.9 on presentation, he
   recieved 6U PRBCs and his HCT went up to 26 and then dropped back to
   22. He was given 2 more U PRBC's. His UOP dropped on [**11-30**] to 20cc/hr
   and he was given several boluses of fluid and his UOP improved. Is no
   longer having bloody bowel movements,  Got TIPS done [**12-3**]. During
   procedure found to have portal vein clot. Had 3L removed during para
   with TIPS. Given 25g albumin and 3L IVF.  After tips HCT drop from 27.2
   to 22.2, to 21.5. Felt to be dilutional, no further bloody BM, no abd
   pain to suggest subcapsular bleed. Liver no longer suspect UC flare,
   finished steroids course. Per liver d/ced cipro and Flagyl as does not
   have UGI bleed in need of ppx. IR reccomends consider US abd to access
   for subcapsular bleed if HCT does not stabilize. Received 2 U pRBC,
   with 20 IV lasix prior and 20 IV lasix after infusion w/good urine
   output. Hct stable 12h post-transfusion and patient is asymptomatic
   >24h post-TIPS procedure.
   - Follow stools

   # SOB: Increased oxygen requirement after TIPS and 3L IVF. CXR c/w
   fluid overload, patient with anasarca. Started nebs and gave Lasix
   boluses. Breathing improved with lasix boluses, but still requiring 3L
   NC O2 to maintain O2 sat in 90's.
   - Lasix boluses, follow electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Baseline is 50-70s, likely secondary to
   NASH/cirrhosis/splenomegaly.  Plt downtreanding to 33. Hold transfusion
   unless signs of active bleeding.
   .
   # Elevated INR: likely due to cirrhosis. Given several units of FFP
   before TIPS procedure with INR never dropping below 1.8. 24h post
   procedure, INR is 1.9.
   .
   # CRI: BL Cr 1.8-2.1.  Currently at baseline, decreaseded to 1.9.
   - Trend Cr
   - Monitor UOP, giving diuretics
   - pm lytes
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds

   # DM2:  Last HbA1c on [**10-9**] was 7.1.  Elevated finger sticks. ISS and
   long-acting insulin titrated up during patient's stay. Added 15U
   Glargine QHS on [**12-4**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis who presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, during which a portal vein clot was found and 3 liters of blood were removed. After the procedure, the patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 27.2 to 22.2 and then to 21.5. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with good urine output and his Hct has been stable for 12 hours post-transfusion. The patient is asymptomatic 24 hours post-TIPS procedure.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including cirrhosis with associated complications such as ascites and coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), constipation, a right medial ankle ulcer, and vomiting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and recent lower GI bleed pose a risk for further bleeding.
2. Portal hypertension: The patient underwent a TIPS procedure to correct portal hypertension, but there is still a risk of recurrent portal hypertension and associated complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet"
