   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG and AVR surgeries. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and osteomyelitis of the right foot leading to amputation. The patient experienced a mechanical fall at home and was found comatose with a large hypertensive thalamic hemorrhage.

The current assessment indicates an intracranial thalamic bleed likely caused by hypertension and a supratherapeutic INR. Given the patient's neurologic status, age, volume, and location of the bleed, the prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery is poor. The patient has previously expressed a wish to be DNR/DNI, and the family discussed goals of care with the surgeon. It was decided not to pursue any further intervention.

The patient has been extubated, and the c-collar has been removed. Morphine is being administered for comfort. Other medical interventions include fasting, insertion of peripheral IV lines, and code status as CMO.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate ranging from 62-76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/38-125/43 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 88%. The patient remains unresponsive.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include further neurological deterioration, development of secondary infections due to immob"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous surgeries including CABG and AVR with mechanical valve. He also has diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and amputations on his right foot. The patient experienced a mechanical fall at home and was found to have a large hypertensive thalamic hemorrhage. He presented in a comatose state.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial thalamic bleed: The patient has a large hypertensive thalamic hemorrhage, which is likely secondary to high blood pressure and a supratherapeutic INR. Given the current neurologic status, age, volume, and location of the bleed, the prognosis for any meaningful neurologic recovery is poor. The presentation with coma and stupor also indicates a poor chance of survival. The patient has previously expressed his wish to be DNR/DNI, and the family discussed goals of care with the neurosurgeon, deciding against further interventions.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's SpO2 level is 88%, indicating possible respiratory distress or infection. Monitoring for signs of pneumonia, such as fever, increased sputum production, or worsening oxygenation, is important.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization and underlying risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease. Prophylaxis measures should be"

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and mechanical aortic valve replacement. He previously had streptococcal endocarditis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and amputation of the digits of his right foot. The patient presented comatose after a mechanical fall at home and was found to have a large hypertensive thalamic hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial thalamic bleed: The patient's current neurologic status, age, volume, and location of the bleed indicate a poor prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery. The presentation with coma and stupor also suggests a poor chance of survival.
2. Respiratory issues: The patient's extubation may lead to respiratory difficulties, especially considering his previous need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged stay in the ICU and mechanical ventilation.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which could potentially lead to pulmonary embolism.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and mechanical aortic valve replacement. He was previously on coumadin, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and had amputation of digits on the right foot. The patient presented comatose after a mechanical fall at home and was found to have a large hypertensive thalamic hemorrhage.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Intracranial thalamic bleed: The patient's neurologic status is poor, and the prognosis for any meaningful recovery is not favorable. Given the coma and stupor, which are associated with the poorest chance of survival, and the patient's previous expression of being DNR/DNI, the focus is on comfort measures only. Neurosurgery recommendations are appreciated, and propofol will be continued as needed to keep the patient comfortable. Follow-up with a final read of the CT head and c-spine is planned, and the c-spine collar can be removed if cleared.
2. FEN - NPO (nothing by mouth).
3. Access - PIV x 2 (peripheral intravenous access).
4. Code - CMO (cardiopulmonary resuscitation status).
5. Dispo - ICU (disposition to the intensive care unit).

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. The 24-hour events, allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications are also not mentioned. There are no changes to the medical and family history. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some unspecified noted changes. The flowsheet data as of 10/22/2165 07:50 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, physical examination findings, and lab/radiology results. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low (94/47 mmHg) within the specified range (91/45 - 137/56 mmHg). This indicates potential hypotension, which can lead to organ perfusion issues and shock if not managed appropriately.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is at 73%, indicating hypoxemia. This could be due to respiratory failure or inadequate oxygen supply. Immediate intervention may be required to ensure adequate oxygenation.

3. Fluid imbalance: The total fluid input and output shows a negative balance of -677 mL since 12 AM. This suggests that the patient is experiencing fluid loss or inadequate fluid resuscitation, which can lead to dehydration or hypovolemia. Monitoring and correction of fluid status are necessary.

4. Unknown peripheral pulses: The peripheral vascular examination reveals"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with h/o HTN, CAD s/p CABG, AVR with mechanical St. [**Male First Name (un) **] s/p strep
   endocarditis on coumadin, DM, PVD s/p osteo and amputation of digits of
   R foot, who had mechanical fall at home presented comatose and found to
   have large hypertensive thalamic hemorrhage.
   .
   #. Intracranial thalamic bleed: Likely secondary to HTN and also in
   context of supratherapeutic INR. Given current neurologic status, age,
   volume and location of bleed, is poor prognosis for any meaningful
   neurologic recovery. Presentation with coma and stupor are also found
   in studies to give the poorest chance of survival. Patient has
   expressed the wish to be DNR/DNI in past. Family discussed goals of
   care in conjunction with Nsurg.
   - neurosurgery following, appreciate recs, no intervention
   - Pt made CMO by family, extubated, c-collar removed
   - Morphine gtt: pt appears comfortable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG and AVR surgeries. He also has diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease with amputations on his right foot. The patient presented to the ICU in a comatose state after experiencing a mechanical fall at home. He was found to have a large hypertensive thalamic hemorrhage. The patient has expressed his wish to be DNR/DNI in the past. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91-137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 73%. The patient's physical examination shows agonal respirations, non-reactive pupils, coarse bilateral breath sounds, normal heart sounds, soft and nontender abdomen, and unresponsive neurologic status. The patient is receiving morphine infusion for pain management and has been extubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial thalamic bleed: The patient has a large hypertensive thalamic hemorrhage, which is likely secondary to hypertension and a supratherapeutic INR. Given the patient's neurologic status, age, volume, and location of the bleed, the prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery is poor. The patient's presentation with coma and stupor indicates a high chance of mortality.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has coarse bilateral breath"
