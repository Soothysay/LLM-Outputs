   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  60 yo F with PMHx sig. for HIV (CD4 cout 139 this admission) who
   was recently hospitalized with cryptococcal meningitis requiring a VP
   shunt ([**2-6**]) who was readmitted with malfunctioning shunt and now has a
   fluid collection in her brain with concern for impending herniation.
   .
   1.  Cerebral fluid collection:  After discussion with Neurosurgery,
   Neurology, and ID, this is most likely an infectious fluid collection
   or possibly a sterile fluid collection given lack of fever and
   leukocytosis.  This is not felt to be a stroke.  The main concern is
   herniation at this point.
   - neuro checks q2 hrs
   - elevated HOB
   - avoid hypotension to maintain CPP
   - cont mannitol 50 g q6; holding for osm >320, Na >150; monitor renal
   failure
   - hold steroids for now given likely infection
   - if pt decompensates will intubate to hyperventilation for pCO2 goal
   of 30 and will STAT page Neurosurg for emergent decompressive
   craniectomy.
   - will intensify cryptococcal infection with ambisome and flucytosine
   - will cover for retrograde infection from abdomen wtih
   vanc/ceftax/flagyl
   - will d/w Neurosurg re: sampling shunt v. LP by IR
   - US-guided aspiration of abdominal fluid collection though previous
   cultures have been negative, which is more reassuring
   .
   2.  Cryptococcal meninigitis:
   - cont ambisome and flucytosine
   .
   3.  Abdominal fluid collection:  Previous cultures from [**2-17**] negative
   for bacterial infection.
   - will cover for retrograde infection from abdomen wtih
   vanc/ceftax/flagyl
   - US-guided aspiration of abdominal fluid collection though previous
   cultures have been negative, which is more reassuring
   .
   4.  Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis:  Pt has been presumptively
   treated for RTA with po sodium bicarb.
   - urine studies
   - replete K
   - replace bicarb via IV/amps
   .
   5.  C. diff:  Pt already completed 10 day course of flagyl.
   - cont flagyl
   .
   6.  HIV/AIDS:
   - Refusing HAART meds
   - Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   7.  Hypothyroidism:
   - cont. levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a significant medical history of HIV (CD4 count 139 this admission) who was recently hospitalized with cryptococcal meningitis requiring a VP shunt. She was readmitted with a malfunctioning shunt and now has a fluid collection in her brain with concern for impending herniation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral fluid collection: The main concern is herniation at this point. The patient should have neuro checks every 2 hours, elevated head of bed, avoid hypotension to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), continue mannitol 50 g q6, monitor renal function, hold steroids for now given likely infection, and prepare for emergent decompressive craniectomy if the patient decompensates.
2. Cryptococcal meningitis: Continue treatment with ambisome and flucytosine.
3. Abdominal fluid collection: Cover for retrograde infection from the abdomen with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. Perform US-guided aspiration of abdominal fluid collection, though previous cultures have been negative.
4. Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis: Treat presumptively for renal tubular acidosis with sodium bicarb. Replete potassium and replace bicarb via IV/amps.
5. Clostridium difficile infection: Continue treatment with flagyl.
6. HIV/AIDS: Refuse HAART medications and start d"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  60 yo F with PMHx sig. for HIV (CD4 cout 139 this admission) who
   was recently hospitalized with cryptococcal meningitis requiring a VP
   shunt ([**2-6**]) who was readmitted with malfunctioning shunt and now has a
   fluid collection in her brain with concern for impending herniation.
   .
   1.  Cerebral fluid collection:  After discussion with Neurosurgery,
   Neurology, and ID, this is most likely an infectious fluid collection
   or possibly a sterile fluid collection given lack of fever and
   leukocytosis.  This is not felt to be a stroke.  The main concern is
   herniation at this point.  Neuro exam markedly worse this AM over acute
   period.  Family made aware and have decided that they do not want
   aggressive intervention regarding surgical treatment.
   - neuro checks q2 hrs
   - elevated HOB
   - avoid hypotension to maintain CPP
   - cont mannitol 50 g q6; holding for osm >320, Na >150; monitor renal
   failure
   - hold steroids for now given likely infection
   - cont  ambisome and flucytosine
   - cont coverage for retrograde infection from abdomen wtih
   vanc/ceftax/flagyl
   - Neurosurgery made aware that patients status has deteriorated this AM
   and that family does not want to pursue operative management or
   intubation
   .
   2.  Cryptococcal meninigitis:
   - cont ambisome and flucytosine
   .
   3.  Abdominal fluid collection:  Previous cultures from [**2-17**] negative
   for bacterial infection.
   - cont coverage for retrograde infection from abdomen wtih
   vanc/ceftax/flagyl
   .
   4.  Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis:  Pt has been presumptively
   treated for RTA with po sodium bicarb.
   - replace bicarb via IV/amps
   .
   5.  C. diff:  Pt already completed 10 day course of flagyl.
   - cont flagyl
   .
   6.  HIV/AIDS:
   - Refusing HAART meds
   - Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   7.  Hypothyroidism:
   - cont. levothyroxine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with significant medical history including HIV (CD4 count 139 this admission), recent hospitalization for cryptococcal meningitis requiring a VP shunt, and readmission with a malfunctioning shunt leading to a fluid collection in her brain with concern for impending herniation.

The patient's current condition includes a markedly decreased level of responsiveness and arousal, movement deficits on the left side of the body, increased muscle tone, upgoing Babinski reflexes bilaterally, and clonus especially in the right upper extremity. Vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and normal blood pressure. The patient is not receiving aggressive intervention regarding surgical treatment for the fluid collection in her brain, as per family decision.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased glucose, prolonged PT/INR, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Other lab values are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Cerebral fluid collection: Infectious or possibly sterile fluid collection, not a stroke, concern for herniation. Neuro checks q2 hrs, elevated HOB, avoid hypotension to maintain CPP, cont mannitol, monitor renal failure, hold steroids, cont coverage for retrograde infection from abdomen with vanc/ceftax/flagyl.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of stroke and meningitis. He was admitted to the ICU with an initial plan for comfort measures only (CMO) due to family request, no plans for surgery or escalation of intervention. The patient has been experiencing a fever of 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit. He has allergies to sulfa antibiotics and had an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of antibiotics. The patient is currently on several medications including vancomycin, ambisome, ceftazidime, metronidazole, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate. 

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate between 90-110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 67/43 mmHg to 143/72 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates an increase in total fluid intake and output with a negative fluid balance of 603 mL. 

The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessment were not performed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits. The patient's blood cultures were positive for bacteria. 

The patient's primary medical complication is impaired physical mobility due to a history of stroke and meningitis. The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and there is no disposition mentioned."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo F with PMHx sig. for HIV (CD4 cout 139 this admission) who was
   recently hospitalized with cryptococcal meningitis requiring a VP shunt
   ([**2-6**]) who was readmitted with malfunctioning shunt and now has a fluid
   collection in her brain with concern for impending herniation.
   .
   1.  Cerebral fluid collection:  After discussion with Neurosurgery,
   Neurology, and ID, this is most likely an infectious fluid collection
   or possibly a sterile fluid collection given lack of fever and
   leukocytosis.  This is not felt to be a stroke.  The main concern is
   herniation at this point.  Neuro exam markedly worse this AM over acute
   period.  Family made aware and have decided that they do not want
   aggressive intervention regarding surgical treatment.
   - neuro checks q2 hrs
   - elevated HOB
   - avoid hypotension to maintain CPP
   - can discontinue mannitol as renal function is worsening and serum osm
   was 316 this morning. (was 50 g q6 with goal osm >320, Na >150)
   - hold steroids for now given likely infection
   - cont  ambisome and flucytosine
   - cont coverage for retrograde infection from abdomen wtih
   vanc/ceftax/flagyl
   - Neurosurgery made aware that patients status has deteriorated and
   that family does not want to pursue operative management or intubation
   .
   2.  Cryptococcal meninigitis:
   - cont ambisome and flucytosine
   .
   3.  Abdominal fluid collection:  Previous cultures from [**2-17**] negative
   for bacterial infection.
   - cont coverage for retrograde infection from abdomen wtih
   vanc/ceftax/flagyl
   .
   4.  Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis:  Pt has been presumptively
   treated for RTA with po sodium bicarb.
   - replace bicarb via IV/amps
   .
   5.  C. diff:  Pt already completed 10 day course of flagyl.
   - cont flagyl
   .
   6.  HIV/AIDS:
   - Refusing HAART meds
   - will discontinue Dapsone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**] for now as patient not taking
   PO
   .
   7.  Hypothyroidism:
   - cont. levothyroxine
   FEN:  NPO
   Prophylaxis:  pneumoboots/heparin sq, PPI, bowel regimen
   Access:  PICC
   Code status:  DNR/DNI, may be made CMO today at which point abx will
   likely be discontinued.
   Dispo:  ICU care for now, family plans to come today to assess goals of
   care today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a significant medical history of HIV (CD4 count 139 this admission) who was recently hospitalized with cryptococcal meningitis requiring a VP shunt. She was readmitted with a malfunctioning shunt and now has a fluid collection in her brain, with concern for impending herniation. The patient's neurologic exam has markedly worsened, and the family has decided against aggressive intervention regarding surgical treatment. The patient's condition includes infectious fluid collection, cryptococcal meningitis, abdominal fluid collection, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, Clostridium difficile infection, HIV/AIDS, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently on DNR/DNI status and will be assessed for CMO status today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral fluid collection: The main concern is herniation at this point.
2. Cryptococcal meningitis: Continuation of antifungal treatment with ambisome and flucytosine.
3. Abdominal fluid collection: Coverage for retrograde infection from the abdomen with vanc/ceftax/flagyl.
4. Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis: Replacement of bicarb via IV/amps.
5. Clostridium difficile infection: Continuation of flagyl.
6. HIV/AIDS: Refusal of HAART medications and discontinuation of Dapsone for PCP.
7. Hypothyroidism: Continuation of levothyroxine."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo F with PMHx sig. for HIV (CD4 cout 139 this admission) who was
   recently hospitalized with cryptococcal meningitis requiring a VP shunt
   ([**2-6**]) who was readmitted with malfunctioning shunt and now has a fluid
   collection in her brain with concern for impending herniation.
   .
   1.  Cerebral fluid collection:  After discussion with Neurosurgery,
   Neurology, and ID, this is most likely an infectious fluid collection
   or possibly a sterile fluid collection given lack of fever and
   leukocytosis.  This is not felt to be a stroke.  The main concern is
   herniation at this point.  Neuro exam markedly worse this AM over acute
   period.  Family made aware and have decided that they do not want
   aggressive intervention regarding surgical treatment.
   - neuro checks q2 hrs
   - elevated HOB
   - avoid hypotension to maintain CPP
   - cont mannitol 50 g q6; holding for osm >320, Na >150; monitor renal
   failure
   - hold steroids for now given likely infection
   - cont  ambisome and flucytosine
   - cont coverage for retrograde infection from abdomen wtih
   vanc/ceftax/flagyl
   - Neurosurgery made aware that patients status has deteriorated this AM
   and that family does not want to pursue operative management or
   intubation
   .
   2.  Cryptococcal meninigitis:
   - cont ambisome and flucytosine
   .
   3.  Abdominal fluid collection:  Previous cultures from [**2-17**] negative
   for bacterial infection.
   - cont coverage for retrograde infection from abdomen wtih
   vanc/ceftax/flagyl
   .
   4.  Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis:  Pt has been presumptively
   treated for RTA with po sodium bicarb.
   - replace bicarb via IV/amps
   .
   5.  C. diff:  Pt already completed 10 day course of flagyl.
   - cont flagyl
   .
   6.  HIV/AIDS:
   - Refusing HAART meds
   - Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a significant medical history of HIV and a current CD4 count of 139. She was recently hospitalized for cryptococcal meningitis and required a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Upon readmission, it was determined that her VP shunt was malfunctioning and there is a fluid collection in her brain, which is causing concern for impending herniation. 

The patient's neurological exam has markedly worsened over the past day, with decreased responsiveness, increased muscle tone, upgoing Babinski's reflexes bilaterally, and clonus in the right upper extremity. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.7°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 111/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.8 thousand cells/mm³, decreased hemoglobin at 8.6 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 109 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's family has made the decision to refrain from aggressive intervention, including surgery or intubation. The plan of care includes neurologic monitoring every two hours, elevation of the head"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of stroke, meningitis, and multiple medical comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia and subsequently diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, and altered mental status. He has received broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications, including Vancomycin, Ambisome, and Ceftazidime, as well as other ICU medications such as Pantoprazole, Heparin Sodium, and Morphine Sulfate. The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with fluctuating blood pressures and temperatures. His respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen only, and his oxygen saturation remains at 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals right pupil dilation, decreased motor strength on the left side, increased muscle tone, upgoing Babinski's reflex bilaterally, and clonus in the right upper extremity. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and abnormal coagulation parameters. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by increased creatinine levels. The patient's overall condition is critical, with impaired physical mobility and markedly decreased responsiveness and level of arousal."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with AIDS who has been diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis, which has resulted in cerebritis and hemiparalysis. The family has opted for comfort measures only (CMO). The patient's fever reached 101.7°F and her temperature is currently at 95.9°F. Her blood pressure is low, ranging from 62-86 mmHg, and her heart rate is slightly elevated at 94 bpm. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is at 97%. 

The patient's vital signs and flow sheet data indicate fluctuations in temperature, blood pressure, and fluid balance. She has received various medications including Ambisome, metronidazole, vancomycin, ceftazidime, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, ampho, flucytosine, dapsone, synthroid, mannitol, and PPI. 

Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the mentioned events. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both extremities. Neurological assessment is limited due to paralysis.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but creatinine and magnesium levels are slightly elevated. Other lab values"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a significant medical history of HIV and recent hospitalization for cryptococcal meningitis. She was readmitted with a malfunctioning VP shunt and now has a fluid collection in her brain, which is concerning for impending herniation. The patient's neurological exam has markedly worsened, and the family has decided against aggressive surgical intervention. The patient is currently on Ambisome and flucytosine for cryptococcal meningitis, vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole for an abdominal fluid collection, and sodium bicarb for presumed RTA. She has completed a 10-day course of flagyl for C. diff. The patient is also being treated for HIV/AIDS, including Dapsone for PCP, but is refusing HAART medications. She has a history of hypothyroidism and has been placed on comfort measures only due to her deteriorating condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impending herniation due to the fluid collection in the brain.
2. Cryptococcal meningitis.
3. Abdominal fluid collection.
4. Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis.
5. Clostridium difficile infection.
6. HIV/AIDS, including opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

She was readmitted with a malfunctioning shunt and now has a fluid collection in her brain with concern for impending herniation. The patient's neurologic exam has markedly worsened over an acute period, and the family has decided against aggressive surgical intervention. The patient is currently on ambisome and flucytosine for cryptococcal meningitis, vancomycin/ceftazidime/flagyl for abdominal fluid collection, and sodium bicarb for hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has completed a 10-day course of flagyl for C. diff and is refusing HAART medications for HIV/AIDS. The patient also has hypothyroidism and has a DNR/DNI code status. The patient is being discussed with palliative care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of decreased level of consciousness. The patient has a history of stroke, meningitis, and allergies to sulfa antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 134 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal limits, respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. The patient is on morphine sulfate infusion for pain control.

Physical examination reveals right pupil being larger than the left, with both pupils reactive to light. The patient has diminished breath sounds at the lung bases. Neurologically, the patient is markedly decreased in responsiveness and arousal, with increased tone and upgoing Babinski's sign bilaterally. Motor strength is weak on the left side, while it is normal on the right side. Clonus is more prominent in the right upper extremity.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Creatinine levels are within normal range, but there is a significant rise in liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and bilirubin. Electrolytes are mostly within normal limits, except for low potassium and slightly elevated bicarbonate levels.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 287 mL over 24 hours. Respiratory support is not required as the patient is breathing"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo F with PMHx sig. for HIV (CD4 cout 139 this admission) who was
   recently hospitalized with cryptococcal meningitis requiring a VP shunt
   ([**2-6**]) who was readmitted with malfunctioning shunt and now has a fluid
   collection in her brain with concern for impending herniation.
   .
   1.  Cerebral fluid collection:  After discussion with Neurosurgery,
   Neurology, and ID, this is most likely an infectious fluid collection
   or possibly a sterile fluid collection given lack of fever and
   leukocytosis.  This is not felt to be a stroke.  The main concern is
   herniation at this point.  Neuro exam markedly worse this AM over acute
   period.  Family made aware and have decided that they do not want

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a significant medical history of HIV and previous hospitalization for cryptococcal meningitis, who presented with a malfunctioning VP shunt and fluid collection in the brain, which is concerning for impending herniation. The patient's neurologic examination has significantly worsened over the acute period. The family has declined aggressive intervention regarding surgical treatment. The patient is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) status and do not wish to receive aggressive treatment.

The patient's fever has increased to 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit. Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 beats per minute, low blood pressure of 88/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient has increased tone with upgoing Babinski's bilaterally, clonus especially in the right upper extremity, and decreased movement in the left upper extremity.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Imaging studies are pending.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including cerebral fluid collection (possibly infectious or sterile), cryptococcal meningitis, abdominal fluid collection (previously negative for bacterial infection), hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis, Clostr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a significant history of HIV and recent hospitalization for cryptococcal meningitis. She has been readmitted with a malfunctioning VP shunt and now presents with a fluid collection in her brain, raising concern for impending herniation. The patient's neurologic examination has markedly worsened, indicating an acute change. The family has declined aggressive intervention regarding surgical treatment. The patient is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Herniation: The main concern at this point is the risk of herniation due to the fluid collection in the brain.
2. Cryptococcal meningitis: The patient continues to be treated with Ambisome and flucytosine for cryptococcal meningitis, but the condition may persist or worsen if not effectively managed.
3. Abdominal fluid collection: The previous cultures from [**2-17**] were negative for bacterial infection, but the patient is still on vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole. The abdominal fluid collection may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis: These conditions need to be closely monitored and managed as part of the patient's overall care.
5. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: Although the patient has completed a 10-day course of Flagyl, there is still a risk of ongoing infection or recurrence.
6. HIV/AIDS: The patient's refusal to take HAART medications poses ongoing risks related to the progression of HIV/AIDS.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient requires management of hypothyroidism, including nutritional support and medication as needed.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information or tests may be necessary to fully assess the patient's condition and potential complications."
