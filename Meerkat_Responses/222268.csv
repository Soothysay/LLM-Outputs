   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response in setting of likely mild pancreatitis.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episode at 3:30PM
   occurred in setting of heart rate of 115 and resolved with metoprolol
   5mg IV x 2, which reduced heart rate to 70s.  Troponin elevation may be
   related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus
   NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the
   same level during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue
   anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be
   established.
   - Enoxaparin 70mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30
   - ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin
   - Trend biomarkers, telemetry, ECGs
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   exacerbated by hypovolemia in setting of gastritis and mild
   pancreatitis.
   - Hold diuretics
   - Uptitrate beta-blockers as tolerated by blood pressure
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not appear to be third spacing.  Unclear
   precipitant, medications vs. gallstones.  Alkaline phosphatase is
   negative suggesting against biliary tree source.
   - Hold furosemide 40mg for now, restart once nausea, vomitting resolved
   and patient taking POs
   - Hold off on IV fluids for now, but can consider 250cc boluses if
   urine output decreases.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue lisinopril, BB

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure, presented with chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and likely mild pancreatitis.
- The patient experienced multiple episodes of chest pain, with one episode occurring during atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which improved with beta-blocker and nitro therapy.
- Repeat EKGs did not show evidence of ST elevations but did show some ST-T wave changes on admission.
- The patient declined cardiac catheterization and increased beta-blocker dose along with starting long-acting Imdur.
- Cardiac enzymes are trending.
- The patient has allergies to Flexeril, Percocet, and Compazine.
- Infusions and other ICU medications include metoprolol, enoxaparin, and morphine sulfate.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for chest pain.
- Vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
- The patient's weight remains unchanged.
- Fluid balance indicates a negative balance of 247 mL since 12 AM.
- Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula with SpO2 at 100%.
- Physical examination reveals well-nourished and overweight-obese appearance, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response in setting of likely mild pancreatitis.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episode at 3:30PM
   occurred in setting of heart rate of 115 and resolved with metoprolol
   5mg IV x 2, which reduced heart rate to 70s.  Troponin elevation may be
   related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus
   NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the
   same level during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue
   anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be
   established. Patient started on lovenox with 70mg SC q24h for
   creatinine clearance < 30

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure presenting with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and likely mild pancreatitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may increase the risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and heart failure exacerbation.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has slightly elevated lipase and amylase levels suggesting mild pancreatitis. If the pancreatitis worsens, it can lead to complications like organ failure, sepsis, and multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Renal complications: The patient has chronic renal failure. There is a risk of worsening renal function due to factors like decreased urine output, fluid overload, and medications that may be nephrotoxic.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of chronic systolic CHF and presents with leg edema. There is a possibility of pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status, especially if the patient's heart failure worsens.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has coccygeal breakdown, indicating potential pressure ulcers. Proper skin care and repositioning are necessary to prevent further skin breakdown and potential infection.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Overnight events of chest pain and Afib with rapid ventricular response
   noted.
   Physical Examination
   JVP remains elevated but less distended. Lungs clear,
   Diffuse PMI, parasternal lift, [**3-15**] harsh AS murmur radiating to neck
   with murmur also headr at apex and subxiphoid space that is more
   blowing in charcater and increases with inspiration consistent with TR
   and MR.
   Medical Decision Making
   Concerned with ongoing symptoms of chest pain. There are multiple
   potential supply and demand issues, including rapid Afib, increased
   filling pressures limiting perfusion and increasing wall stress, and
   very likely significnt lesion of one or both remaining vein grafts. She
   continues to refuse cardiac cath but is amenable to other therapies
   short of resuscitation or intubation. Will continue very gentle
   diuresis with goal - 500 cc, rate control with metoprolol, add
   nitrates.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Unstable cardiac symptoms related to ischemia and acute systolic and
   diastolic  heart failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and mild pancreatitis. The patient presented with chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac Complications:
- Unstable angina or myocardial infarction due to ischemia.
- Heart failure exacerbation due to increased filling pressures and decreased cardiac output.
- Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

2. Respiratory Complications:
- Pulmonary edema due to left-sided heart failure.
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to hypoxemia and fluid overload.

3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
- Nausea and vomiting due to gastritis or pancreatitis.
- Aspiration pneumonia due to impaired swallowing and cough reflexes.

4. Renal Complications:
- Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis or nephrotoxic drugs.
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression due to long-standing hypertension, diabetes, or other underlying causes.

5. Infectious Complications:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
- Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) due to central venous catheters.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV.
   Troponin elevation may be related to demand in setting of atrial
   fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is
   stable near 400, which was the same level during her last admission.
   Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation until more definitive trend
   for troponins can be established. Patient started on lovenox with 70mg
   SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin
   - Given hypotension could only tolerate Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Trend biomarkers, telemetry, ECGs

   - Have discussed treatment options with pt
   - Consider rinolazone
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   exacerbated by hypovolemia in setting of gastritis and mild
   pancreatitis. Uptitrated beta blockers yesterday.
   - restart diuretic
   - continue BB at current dose, consider uptitration as tolerated
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue lisinopril, BB
   - diruesis with goal I /o negative -500 cc per day
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not appear to be third spacing.  Unclear
   precipitant, medications vs. gallstones.  Alkaline phosphatase is
   negative suggesting against biliary tree source.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. She presents with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient has been treated with NTG drip and MS IV for her symptoms, which she tolerated well. Troponin elevation may be related to demand in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR or NSTEMI. However, given the stable CPK level near 400, it is more likely to be related to the former. Anticoagulation has been continued until further trend for troponins can be established.

The patient is currently on several medications including ASA, Plavix, metoprolol (decreased to 50mg PO BID due to hypotension), lisinopril, atorvastatin, and lovenox (increased to 80mg daily). The plan is to continue these medications.

The patient has refused cardiac catheterization, and treatment options have been discussed with her. Consideration is being given to renin-angiotensin system blockade.

The patient's rhythm remains atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Beta-blockers have been restarted and uptitrated yesterday. Digoxin is being continued with an appropriate level of 1.0.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. She presented with chest discomfort due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Despite treatment with beta-blockers, her blood pressures have been borderline, limiting the use of additional anti-anginal medications. She has had episodes of chest pain associated with atrial fibrillation but has responded well to nitroglycerin and morphine IV. Troponin levels are elevated, which may be related to increased cardiac demand due to atrial fibrillation or a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, considering the stable CPK levels and previous admission CPK levels, it is more likely that the troponin elevation is due to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR rather than NSTEMI. The patient has been started on Lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening chest pain and potential progression to a myocardial infarction.
2. Development of further arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias.
3. Hypotension due to the use of NTG and morphine, potentially leading to decreased tissue perfusion.
4. Progression of congestive heart failure symptoms, including dyspnea and fluid overload.
5. Skin breakdown and potential development of pressure ulcers due to immobility.
6. Infection, particularly in the setting of central venous catheters and urinary catheter.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy.
8. Stress-related mucosal disease and gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Continued troponin elevation indicating ongoing myocardial injury or ischemia.
10. End-stage coronary artery disease may lead to further complications and reduced quality of life."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount, will try 25 Q8 hours metoprolol in order
   to optimize.
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, lisinopril, refusing atorvastatin
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Continue imdur
   - Consider ranolazine, fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in
   setting of end-stage CAD.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Goal 500-1L negative. Will resume home dose lasix of
   40mg PO daily.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue lisinopril, BB
   - diruesis with goal I /o negative -500 cc per day

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Recurrent episodes of chest pain, some of which are atypical for usual
   ischemic pain.
   Physical Examination
   HR 120s.
   JVP >16 with prominent v wave
   AS and TR murmurs
   Medical Decision Making
   Improving. Rate control remains an issue as does borderline hypotension
   Will increase metoprolol to 25 mg tid; Continue oral nitrates together
   with other heart failure regimen as recorded above.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. She presents with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's condition has been complicated by recurrent episodes of chest pain, which may be related to atrial fibrillation with RVR or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, the chest pain seems to have resolved, and the patient's troponin levels are stable near 400.

The patient has shown poor tolerance to anti-anginal treatment due to borderline blood pressures. Rate control is a priority, and the doctor plans to increase metoprolol to 25 mg three times a day. The patient will continue on lovenox, ASA, Plavix, and lisinopril. However, the patient has refused cardiac catheterization and atorvastatin. Consideration will be given to ranolazine and a fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in the setting of end-stage CAD.

The patient's rhythm remains atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and beta-blockers will be uptitrated as previously mentioned. Diuretics will be used to reduce preload, afterload, wall stress, demand, ischemia, and chest pain. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500-1000 mL per day. Digoxin will continue to be administered at an appropriate level of 1."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. She presents with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's chest pain has been treated with nitroglycerin and morphine IV, and she is currently stable. Troponin elevation may be related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI. The patient has refused cardiac catheterization.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response puts her at risk for further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to her underlying heart failure. She may be at risk for pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Renal complications: The patient has chronic renal failure, which can worsen during episodes of hypotension or if there is inadequate perfusion.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has experienced nausea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. There is also a suspicion of mild pancreatitis, which requires close monitoring.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed a coccygeal pressure ulcer, indicating the need for appropriate skin care and pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. She presented with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's chest pain was initially treated with nitrates and morphine, but she experienced nausea after receiving Zofran. The creatinine level increased, so Lisinopril was discontinued and Lasix 40 PO daily was started, resulting in minimal urine output. The patient received a 250cc bolus twice overnight due to low urine output, which improved to approximately 40/hr each time.

The patient's metoprolol dosage was increased to 25 mg three times a day, and she tolerated it well. The patient also refused an 80mg dose of statin. She had another episode of chest pain under the left breast and received morphine 1mg three times. The EKG remained unchanged from admission.

Allergies include Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine Hcl) and Percocet (Oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen), both causing nausea/vomiting. The last dose of antibiotics was administered on [**2171-2-18**] 06:41 AM.

Infusions and other ICU medications include morphine sulfate. Other medications are as follows: Lipase, Amylase, Reglan, Lasix, Metoprolol, and Statin.

Review of Systems remains unchanged from admission except for the chest pain episodes.

Flow Sheet Data as of [**2171-2-18**] 06:49 AM shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and her weight remains at 80.1 kg.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Creatinine levels have been increasing, while troponin T levels are slightly elevated but may be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Other lab values include potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, and magnesium.

Assessment and Plan include the patient's severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and chest discomfort associated with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient tolerated beta-blockers poorly due to low blood pressure and had episodes of chest pain. Troponin elevation may be related to demand in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR or NSTEMI. The patient started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance <30.

The plan includes optimizing rate control with metoprolol, continuing lovenox, ASA, Plavix, lisinopril (refused by the patient), refusing atorvastatin, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - Trial of ranolazine today, monitor QTc.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress

   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
   # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix
   as needed.
   # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Continued frequent angina
   Physical Examination
   BP 90s; HR 90-100
   Marked JVP elevation with prominent v wave.
   Medical Decision Making
   Difficulty controlling rate due to hypotension.
   creatinine elevation in setting of diuresis and ACE inhibitor - on hold
   and anemia.
   She continues to refuse cardiac cath.
   Will begin around the clock narcotic analgesics.
   Consider ranolazine.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure who presents with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been experiencing recurrent episodes of chest pain associated with her rapid ventricular response. 

The patient's medical history is significant for end-stage, non-intervenable coronary disease, and she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline blood pressures. Her current medications include ASA, Plavix, a statin (lowered dose per patient request), and Lisinopril, which has been held due to elevated creatinine levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals several findings, including an elevated JVP with a prominent v wave, a diffuse PMI, RV heave, and mid-peaking systolic murmur, as well as a holosystolic murmur at the apex. She also has stage II sacral decubitus noted on admission and 2+ peripheral edema.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a heart rate of 92 bpm (with a baseline of 73-113 bpm), a blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg (with a baseline of 66-159/31-93 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (with a baseline of 13-27 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 99%.

   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. She presents with chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been treated with various medications, including beta-blockers, nitroglycerin, morphine, and aspirin. She has also been given lovenox for anticoagulation. The patient's condition is complicated by chronic systolic CHF, anemia, and skin breakdown. The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and prefers a more palliative approach. The patient's medical team is focused on rate control, diuresis, and improving pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of systolic CHF: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine suggest that her renal function may be compromised, leading to fluid overload and worsening of her heart failure symptoms.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Despite being on anticoagulation therapy, the patient has a high risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization and decreased blood flow.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): If a DVT were to occur, it could potentially lead to a PE, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical intervention.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient already has stage II sacral decubitus, indicating the risk of further skin breakdown and potential infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of nausea. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and acute renal failure. He is currently in the ICU for chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and troponin-T. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 210 mL. The patient is receiving morphine for pain management and has been given Zofran for nausea, which he refused. The patient's condition is being monitored closely, and pending consults from SW and PPC teams are noted. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient continues to complain of nausea, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is not assessed, and the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores may be present due to prolonged bed rest.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and elevated troponin-T levels indicate potential cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy or myocardial injury.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and previous episodes of low urine output suggest ongoing renal dysfunction, which may require further intervention.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible inadequate perfusion and the need for close monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support.
6. Respiratory Issues: Although the patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, the ABG results are pending, and there may be underlying respiratory problems that need attention.
7. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's elevated potassium level requires careful monitoring and management to prevent cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
8. Infection Risk: The patient's immune system may be compromised, increasing the risk of infections, particularly in the ICU setting."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount, will try 25 Q8 hours metoprolol in order
   to optimize.
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, lisinopril, refusing atorvastatin
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Continue imdur
   - Consider ranolazine, fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in
   setting of end-stage CAD.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Goal 500-1L negative. Will resume home dose lasix of
   40mg PO daily.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue lisinopril, BB
   - diruesis with goal I /o negative -500 cc per day
   .
   # Skin breakdown

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. She presents with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient has been experiencing nausea after receiving Zofran and refused Reglan. Her creatinine levels are elevated, and she was taken off Lisinopril. Lasix 40 PO daily was added, but it resulted in minimal urine output. The patient received a 250cc bolus twice overnight to improve urine output, which increased to approximately 40/hr each time.

The patient's medications include morphine sulfate, metoprolol increased to 25 mg tid, and a decrease in statin dosage to 20 mg PO daily due to refusal of the higher dose. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (with a baseline of 73-113 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 102/51-159/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (with a baseline of 13-27 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 99%, and she is in atrial fibrillation.

   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload

   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. She presented with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The chest pain was initially treated with beta-blockers but was limited by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to demand in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response versus NSTEMI. The patient has end-stage, non-intervenable coronary disease and poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline blood pressures. Rate control is being emphasized, and the patient will be uptitrated on beta-blockers. Anticoagulation will continue until more definitive trends for troponins can be established. The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and prefers a more palliative approach. She has also refused wound care bed and prefers to lie on her side instead.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest pain due to ischemia and coronary artery disease.
2. Hypotension limiting the use of beta-blockers for rate control.
3. Elevated troponin levels indicating possible myocardial injury.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
5. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure with leg edema and elevated JVP.
6. Anemia with persistent low hemoglobin concentration.
7. Skin breakdown with coccygeal breakdown.
8. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure. She presented with chest pain in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's troponin elevation may be related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI, and it is likely a former due to stable CPK levels near 400.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications:
   - Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   - Systolic congestive heart failure.
   - Chest pain related to coronary artery disease.

2. Renal complications:
   - Acute on chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels from 1.5 to 2.5 yesterday.
   - Holding lasix and ACE inhibitors due to elevated creatinine levels.

3. Anemia:
   - Persistent low hct. Transfused additional unit pRBCs today.
   - Continuing to follow Hct levels.

4. Skin breakdown:
   - Coccygeal breakdown due to prolonged sitting or lying in one position.
   - Refusal of wound care bed or lying on her side.

5. Respiratory complications:
   - No acute distress or respiratory issues noted in the physical examination.

6. Gastrointestinal complications:
   - Increased bowel regimen as per palliative care recommendations.
   - Stress ulcer prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix
   as needed.
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and systolic congestive heart failure presenting with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been experiencing chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain and nausea have been much better controlled on MS Contin. The patient is willing to take bowel medications and heparin subcutaneously. Appetite has also improved.

The patient's allergies include Flexeril (Oral) (Cyclobenzaprine Hcl) and Percocet (Oral) (Oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen). The last dose of antibiotics was not mentioned.

The patient has been on several medications including Morphine Sulfate, Enoxaparin (Lovenox), and Pantoprazole (Protonix).

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate of 67 bpm (64-95), blood pressure of 81/39 mmHg (50/26-135/91), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (13-23), and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient has atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1440 mL, with 770 mL given through the PO route, 250 mL through TF, 500 mL through IVF, and 350 mL of blood products. Total output includes 580 mL through urine, 140 mL through NG, and 630 mL through drains. The balance is 860 mL.

The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and SpO2 of 98%. ABG results are not provided.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, awake, alert, pleasant appearance. The cardiovascular examination shows a hyperdynamic point of maximal impulse (PMI), irregularly irregular rhythm, and a systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border (LUSB) with a blowing holosystolic murmur at the apex.

Laboratory values include a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.1%, platelet count of 61 K/uL, creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 25.1 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 25.1%, glucose of 91 mg/dL, and magnesium of 2.5 mg/dL. Troponin T levels are elevated. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's chest pain is likely related to old-infarcts and changes have now resolved. Some contribution may be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient initially treated with beta-blockers but systolic blood pressures have not been high enough to tolerate this. The patient did well with nitroglycerin (NTG) drip and morphine sulfate IV, limited again by hypotension. The troponin elevation may be related to demand in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response versus non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It is likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level during her last admission. Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. The patient started on lovenox with 80 mg subcutaneously every 24 hours for creatinine clearance < 30.

The patient has end-stage, non-intervenable coronary disease and poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline blood pressures. Rate control is tantamount, will increase beta-blockers to 37.5 TID today. The last dose of lovenox will be tonight. The patient will be on aspirin, Plavix, and a statin (lowered dose per patient request). ACE inhibitor is on hold due to elevated creatinine. The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and prefers a more palliative approach.

The patient does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will discontinue to give room on blood pressure to increase beta-blockers. Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in the setting of end-stage CAD. For now, will try long-acting oral morphine for improved pain control.

The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Uptitrate beta-blockers as above. Diuretics will be used to reduce preload and afterload, wall stress, demand, ischemia, and chest pain. Low urine output, increased creatinine, and elevated potassium overnight. Hold lasix for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.

Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0. The patient is refusing long-term anticoagulation, discontinue lovenox tonight.

Chronic systolic CHF - leg edema is at baseline, and the patient is not any more dyspneic than baseline. The chest x-ray is clear. Elevated JVP may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.

Continue beta-blockers, ACE inhibitor on hold for increased creatinine. Goal fluid even.

Anemia - the patient has persistent low hct. Given ongoing angina, will offer packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for improved oxygen delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix as needed.

Skin breakdown - the patient has apparent coccygeal breakdown as per nursing. The patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead. As per nursing, wound care consult is not necessary. Out of bed today.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, also patient declines cardiac cath, she poorly tolerates
   anti-anginal treatment due to borderline BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  increased BB to 37.5 TID, rate
   well-controlled with this.
   - last dose lovenox [**2-18**].
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - palliative care consulted, appreciate their recs
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Started on MS contin yesterday with very good effect.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitratde beta blockers as above.
   - Cont. BB as above
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, completed lovenox x 3days for
   ACS
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, was
   transfused yesterday without appropriate bump.
   -Transfuse additional unit pRBCs today
   - Cont. to follow Hct
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr bumped from 1.5->2.5 yesterday.
   Felt to be [**2-11**] pre-renal etiology, diuresis and CHF.  Cr stable today.
   - Given blood for volume today
   - Holding lasix and ACE
   - Cont. to follow
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease and chronic systolic heart failure. She presented with chest discomfort, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and elevated troponin levels. The troponin elevation may be related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI. The patient has declined cardiac catheterization and prefers a palliative approach. She is currently on morphine sulfate for pain management, enoxaparin for anticoagulation, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and has an order for blood transfusion due to persistent low hct. Her creatinine level increased from 1.5 to 2.5 yesterday, indicating acute on chronic renal failure, possibly pre-renal etiology. The patient has leg edema and elevated JVP, which may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. She also has a coccygeal breakdown and refuses wound care. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is considering home with hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of coronary artery disease: The patient's severe coronary artery disease puts her at risk for further cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure can worsen, leading to increased symptoms like dyspnea and fluid retention.
3. Atrial fibrillation"
