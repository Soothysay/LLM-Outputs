   Assessment and Plan
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Family gives history of being more
   tired and lethargic x few days, perhaps due to hypoventilation.
   Patient with severe COPD at baseline, presenting with hypoxia and ABG
   showing acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  Possible viral prodrome
   with resultant COPD exacerbation.  Also with OSA and ?recent with CPAP
   compliance per family - this may have worsened hypoventilation.  Also
   concern of patient falling - CNS bleed ruled out by prelim head CT
   read.  Patient with baseline hypoxia but was significantly hypoxic upon
   presentation - obstructive disease vs. fluid overload vs. infectious
   process.
   - f/u final read of  head and chest CTs.
   - Frequent neuro checks.
   - Workup of ?RUL process (simple nodule/tumor (BAC in particular) vs.
   post obstructive or consolidative process - will send for chest CT at
   same time. Also will send AFB sputums to r/o TB, continue respiratory
   airborne precautions.
   - Consider viral swabs.
   - F/u sputum culture, and blood cultures.
   - Check TTE for eval valvular disease and systolic function.
   - Coverage of CAP and aspiration pneumonias with levo/flagyl; will also
   give vanc for MRSA coverage though less likely.
   - COPD exacerbation management with solumedrol (60 IV Q8 tonight and
   starting 60 pred this AM).
   - ATC and prn nebs.
   - Hold off on diuresis for now, though may need some prior to
   extubation.
   - Continue on AC settings while workup being done; SBT as early as AM
   though may be prolonged course before ready for vent liberation given
   underlying lung disease.  Need to discuss concerns further with family
   after above workup completed.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   - Hold off on CVL for now.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Steroids IV and start PO prednisone tomorrow.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia, vs.
   distributive or cardiogenic shock.  Improving with Cr of 2.8 this
   morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Hold ACEI.
   --  More likely prerenal now, can give gentle IVF until better
   assessment of cardiac function.
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  First 2 sets CEs
   underwhelming.
   - Continue to cycle.
   - ECG this morning.
   - Check TTE.
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - No meds to suggest cause for decreased PLTs; stable since admission.
   Check smear.
   - TSH normal.
   .
   # OSA.
   - CPAP at night once extubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of COPD, hypertension, and presenting with shortness of breath. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has severe emphysema with irregular consolidation and nodularity in the right upper lobe, suggesting an infection that cannot be ruled out as tuberculosis. There are also tiny bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis. 

The patient has a subgaleal fluid collection overlying the right occiput. Her cardiac enzymes show a troponin T level of 0.4 x 2, indicating some cardiac involvement. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST mode on the ventilator, set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance of 71.4 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's blood work shows leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.1 K/uL and an elevated BUN of 66 mg/dL with a creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL. Her electrolytes show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 123 mg/dL and hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.0 mEq/L.

   - ATC and prn nebs.
   - Hold off on diuresis for now, though may need some prior to
   extubation.
   - SBT as early as AM though may be prolonged course before ready for
   vent liberation given underlying lung disease.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   - Hold off on CVL for now.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Steroids IV and start PO prednisone tomorrow.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia, vs.
   distributive or cardiogenic shock.  Improving with Cr of 2.8 this
   morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACEI
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  First 2 sets CEs
   underwhelming.
   - Continue to cycle.
   - ECG this morning.
   - Check TTE.
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - No meds to suggest cause for decreased PLTs; stable since admission.
   Trend.
   - TSH normal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and on home oxygen. He presented with shortness of breath and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a preliminary CT chest showing irregular consolidation and nodularity in the right upper lobe, suggesting an infection that cannot be ruled out as tuberculosis. The CT head showed no intracranial hemorrhage but revealed pan-sinus disease with fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoid air cells. The patient has an elevated BUN and creatinine level, indicating possible acute renal failure, which is improving with conservative management. The patient also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to anemia of chronic disease related to underlying COPD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation and hypercarbic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in respiratory function, potentially requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Infection: The presence of irregular consolidation and nodularity in the right upper lobe raises concern for an infectious process, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. If left untreated, this could progress to a more severe infection and systemic involvement.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's initial elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. If not managed properly, this could lead to worsening renal function and potential complications such as fluid overload or electroly"

   Final Chest CT read:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Probably right upper lobe pneumonia. Six-week followup radiograph to
   document resolution is recommended to exclude an underlying neoplasm.
   2. Bibasilar atelectasis and small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions.
   3. T8 compression fracture of indeterminate chronicity.
   4. Right renal cyst, incompletely characterized. Recommend correlation
   with
   US.
   5. Probable pulmonary hypertension.
   Final Head CT Read:
   MPRESSION:
   1. No intracranial hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality.
   2. 10-mm subgaleal low-attenuation fluid collection, without underlying
   bony
   abnormality or inflammatory change in the overlying subcutaneous
   tissues.
   3. Pansinus disease, with fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoid air
   cells
   and complete opacification of right mastoid air cells.
   ECHO: mildly dilated LA. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Hyperdynamic LV systolic fcn
   (EF>75%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild)
   left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. Trivial MR. There is a very
   small pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied, hyperdynamic left ventricle. No
   clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
   Microbiology: BAL [**1-18**]: gram stain neg. No microorganisms seen.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation most likely
   triggered by pneumonia given results of sputum gram stain and mild
   fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - Systolic function hyperdynamic, but pt with mild diastolic heart
   dysfunction; continue to hold off on diuretics unless needed.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily, ATC
   and nebs.
   - SBT this AM with repeat gas to assess if ready for extubation showed
   increasing PCO2 and decreasing pH. Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 in
   attempt to offset some of pt
s metabolic acidosis that may be
   contributing to acidemia, and will attempt extubation later today.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal given BUN/Cr >20%, FeNa 0.2% and FeUrea 35%.
   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.8
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 68/1.8.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACEI
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  CEs underwhelming.
   - ECG without acute changes.
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts, but these are improved today at 181.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD. HCT stable today at 25.8.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - No meds to suggest cause for decreased PLTs; stable since admission.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He presented with shortness of breath and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely triggered by pneumonia. The patient also has mild fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Imaging results indicate a right upper lobe process consistent with pneumonia or neoplasm, bilateral atelectasis, small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, T8 compression fracture of indeterminate chronicity, right renal cyst, and probable pulmonary hypertension.

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to COPD exacerbation triggered by pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a right upper lobe process consistent with pneumonia or neoplasm, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypercarbic respiratory failure and shortness of breath. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with sputum culture, which showed gram-positive cocci in pairs. The patient also has a right upper lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia or neoplasm. The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary nodule, hypotension, falls, chronic renal failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current medications include propofol, midazolam, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests a possible pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on the sensitivity results of the sputum culture.
3. Neoplasm: The chest X-ray findings could also be consistent with a lung neoplasm. Further evaluation with additional imaging studies, such as a CT scan, may be needed to determine the nature of the lesion.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD increases the risk of exacerbations. Management should include bronchodilators, corticosteroids"

   5. Probable pulmonary hypertension.
   Final Head CT Read:
   MPRESSION:
   1. No intracranial hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality.
   2. 10-mm subgaleal low-attenuation fluid collection, without underlying
   bony
   abnormality or inflammatory change in the overlying subcutaneous
   tissues.

   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Hyperdynamic LV systolic fcn
   (EF>75%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild)
   left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. Trivial MR. There is a very

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation triggered by
   possible worsening obstructive disease vs. fluid overload vs.
   infectious process or some combination of these.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - Systolic function hyperdynamic, but pt with mild diastolic heart
   dysfunction.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily.
   - ATC and nebs.
   - Hold off on diuresis for now, though may need some prior to
   extubation.
   - SBT as early as AM though may be prolonged course before ready for
   vent liberation given underlying lung disease.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal given BUN/Cr >20%, FeNa 0.2% and FeUrea 35%.
   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.8
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 68/1.8.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACEI
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  CEs underwhelming.
   - ECG without acute changes.
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts, but these are improved today at 181.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD. HCT stable today at 25.8.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - No meds to suggest cause for decreased PLTs; stable since admission.
   Trend.
   - TSH normal.
   .
   # OSA.
   - CPAP at night once extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and oxygen dependence. He presented with shortness of breath and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's 24-hour events include a TTE showing mild left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 75% and mild diastolic dysfunction, a chest X-ray suggesting pneumonia or neoplasm in the right upper lobe, bronchoscopy with gram stain from BAL negative, endotracheal sputum gram stain demonstrating gram-positive cocci in pairs, urine electrolytes with a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 0.2% and fractional excretion of urea (FeUrea) of 35%, and improving creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This condition can occur due to COPD exacerbation triggered by worsening obstructive disease, fluid overload, or an infectious process.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a chest X-ray indicating pneumonia or neoplasm in the right upper lobe. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's recent BUN/Cr ratio of 69/4.2 suggests acute renal failure, likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia and poor forward flow. Monitoring strict ins and outs, avoiding nephrotoxic drugs, and dose adjustment of medications are"

   Imaging: CXR [**1-18**]: Right upper lobe process is consistent with pneumonia
   or neoplasm.
   Final Chest CT read:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Probably right upper lobe pneumonia. Six-week followup radiograph to
   document resolution is recommended to exclude an underlying neoplasm.
   2. Bibasilar atelectasis and small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions.
   3. T8 compression fracture of indeterminate chronicity.
   4. Right renal cyst, incompletely characterized. Recommend correlation
   with
   US.
   5. Probable pulmonary hypertension.
   Final Head CT Read:
   MPRESSION:
   1. No intracranial hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality.
   2. 10-mm subgaleal low-attenuation fluid collection, without underlying
   bony
   abnormality or inflammatory change in the overlying subcutaneous
   tissues.
   3. Pansinus disease, with fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoid air
   cells
   and complete opacification of right mastoid air cells.
   ECHO: mildly dilated LA. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Hyperdynamic LV systolic fcn
   (EF>75%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild)
   left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. Trivial MR. There is a very
   small pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied, hyperdynamic left ventricle. No
   clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
   Microbiology: BAL [**1-18**]: gram stain neg. No microorganisms seen.

   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - Systolic function hyperdynamic, but pt with mild diastolic heart
   dysfunction; continue to hold off on diuretics unless needed.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily, ATC
   and nebs.
   - SBT this AM with repeat gas to assess if ready for extubation.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation most likely
   triggered by pneumonia given results of sputum gram stain and mild
   fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Extubated yesterday
   without difficulty. Most recent ABG reassuring.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily,
   could start tapering. Continue bronchodilator therapy.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal given BUN/Cr >20%, FeNa 0.2% and FeUrea 35%.
   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.1
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 57/1.1.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACE-I
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts, but these are improved today at 195.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD. HCT stable today at 27.
   - Trend.
   - TSH normal.
   .
   # OSA.
   - CPAP at night now that pt is extubated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who presented with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement since being extubated yesterday. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, which is likely the underlying cause of her hypercarbic respiratory failure. It is important to continue managing her COPD exacerbation with bronchodilator therapy and steroids.

2. Pneumonia: The chest CTs indicate possible pneumonia, and the sputum gram stain shows the presence of gram-positive cocci, suggesting a possible pneumococcal infection. The patient is already receiving antibiotic coverage for this.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient initially presented with a significantly elevated BUN/Cr ratio, indicating potential acute renal failure. However, her creatinine level has improved to 1.1 today, suggesting an improvement. It is important to continue monitoring her renal function and avoid nephrotoxic drugs.

4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's Hct level was low at 29 in the past, and her platelet count was also initially low. These conditions require further evaluation, as they may be related to her underlying COPD or other causes. Trending these parameters is recommended.

5. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA):"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He presented with shortness of breath and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to a COPD exacerbation triggered by pneumonia. The patient had mild fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction and was extubated yesterday without difficulty. Most recent ABG results are reassuring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. If not properly managed, it can lead to respiratory acidosis and further complications such as hypoxemia, arrhythmias, and increased intracranial pressure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum gram stain showed the presence of gram-positive cocci, indicating a possible bacterial infection. If left untreated, pneumonia can worsen the patient's respiratory status and lead to sepsis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's initial BUN/Cr levels were significantly elevated, suggesting acute renal failure. Proper management of fluid balance and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs are crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and low platelet count, which may be due to anemia of chronic disease related to underlying COPD. Monitoring and addressing the cause of these abnormalities is important"

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation most likely
   triggered by pneumonia given results of sputum gram stain and mild
   fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - Systolic function hyperdynamic, but pt with mild diastolic heart
   dysfunction; continue to hold off on diuretics unless needed.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily, ATC
   and nebs.
   - SBT this AM with repeat gas to assess if ready for extubation showed
   increasing PCO2 and decreasing pH. Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 in
   attempt to offset some of pt
s metabolic acidosis that may be
   contributing to acidemia, and will attempt extubation later today.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal given BUN/Cr >20%, FeNa 0.2% and FeUrea 35%.
   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.8
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 68/1.8.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACEI
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  CEs underwhelming.
   - ECG without acute changes.
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts, but these are improved today at 181.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD. HCT stable today at 25.8.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - No meds to suggest cause for decreased PLTs; stable since admission.
   Trend.
   - TSH normal.
   .
   # OSA.
   - CPAP at night once extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and currently experiencing shortness of breath. He was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is most likely due to a COPD exacerbation triggered by pneumonia. The patient also has mild fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction. The chest CTs indicate pneumonia, and the sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci that are likely pneumococcus. The patient is currently on levofloxacin for antibiotic coverage. He has been extubated and put on CPAP overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is borderline hypotensive. His renal function has improved from acute renal failure, and his anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely due to anemia of chronic disease. The patient has a history of OSA and will be on CPAP at night once extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, along with the positive findings on the sputum gram stain, suggest an ongoing infection. It is essential to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the pneumonia.

2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and the current presentation suggest an exacerbation of the condition. Management should include bronchodilators, steroids, and continued oxygen therapy.

3. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient has mild fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Monitoring fluid intake and"
