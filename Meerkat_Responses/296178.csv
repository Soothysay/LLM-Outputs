   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 73 yoM with h/o CAD, systolic CHF (EF 20%), s/p pacer and
   ICD, presents with fever, hypoglycemia, possible sepsis.
   .
   #. Possible Sepsis - evidence of hypoperfusion with lactate peak in ED
   of 8.1, improved to 4.1-->3.3 with fluids. Now down to 2.8 overnight.
   Unclear etiology but most likely source at this point appear pulmonary.
   Given antecedent URI type sxs and sick contact, flu can't be ruled out.
   -- will cover potential pulm source with HAP PNA antibiotics
   (Vanc/Zosyn)
   -- obtain sputum sample if possible
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- r/o flu with nasopharyngeal aspirate
   -- supplemental IVF to maintain CVP >12 (currently at goal)
   -- once CVP 12, titrate levophed to MAP >65
   -- keep central SvO2 > 70% - currently 72%
   -- if falls below 70%, consider pRBC transfusion to 30, and then
   dobutamine to increase cardiac output
   .
   # Hypoglycemia - likely from ongoing sepsis
   -- D10 gtt with q1h FSG
   -- amps of D50 prn FSG <80
   .
   # Abnormal Diff - diff with 62 nRBCs, but no extreme anemia to provoke
   this. LDH and LFTs elevated, although chronic, but concern for
   underlying malignant process.
   -- would recheck, consider heme consult if not resolving
   .
   #. CAD s/p MI: No evidence of ischemia on EKG. One set of enzymes were
   negative int he ED but pt never complained of any chest pain.
   -- CE negative x1.
   -- continue ASA and statin, hold toprol and lisinopril
   -- monitor telemetry
   .
   #. chronic systolic CHF: does not appear to be in florid decompensated
   CHF at this time. He reported only mild SOB, and CXR did not reveal
   evidence of pulmonary edema.
   -- hold Toprol XL, lisinopril, and lasix given hypotension
   -- if concern for volume overload as a result of sepsis resuscitation,
   can consider morphine, nitro, BiPAP
   .
   #. A-fib. Pt is rate controlled with metoprolol and anti-coagulated on
   coumadin. Pt also has a pacer for tachy/brady.
   -- continue coumadin, trend INR daily
   -- holding BB for now given hypotension, can use IV prn if RVR
   .
   #. CRI - baseline Cr 1.1-1.5: Pt with Cr 1.4 on admission. A pre renal
   or ATN insult may develop given his hypotension.
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr

   # Type II DM: pt currently hypoglycemic
   -- hold oral hypoglycemics
   -- FSG QIDACHS, cover with ISS when hypoglycemia resolves
   .
   # HTN: baseline SBP 100-110.
   -- hold all antihypertensives given sepsis
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: The patient has had chronically elevated LFTs

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), and previous pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. He presented with fever, hypoglycemia, and possible sepsis.

The patient has been receiving volume resuscitation and remains on one pressor. His CVO2 saturation is 72%, so he was not transfused. He remains hypoglycemic despite receiving dextrose 10% and ampules of dextrose 50%. There is no respiratory distress.

The patient's allergies include sulfa (sulfonamides), which caused a rash; verapamil, which caused nausea/vomiting; salmeterol, which caused cough; tiotropium, which also caused cough; nystatin, which caused redness and pain; tricor (oral) (fenofibrate nanocrystallized), which caused leg cramps; and Flovent HFA (inhalation) (fluticasone propionate), which caused ankle swelling.

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin-tazobactam at 02:00 AM. He is currently receiving norepinephrine at a dose of 0.04 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started at 12:12 AM and dextrose 50%"

   Monitoring and support devices remain in place. Enlargement of the
   cardiac
   silhouette persists. Opacification is again seen in both lower lungs,
   especially behind the heart. This most likely is consistent with
   atelectasis
   and possible small effusions. In view of the clinical history, the
   possibility of superimposed consolidation cannot be definitely
   excluded.
   Lateral view would be most helpful if the condition of the patient
   persists.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 73 yoM with h/o CAD, systolic CHF (EF 20%), s/p pacer and
   ICD, presents with fever, hypoglycemia amd shock, possible sepsis.
   .
   #. Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with lactate peak
   in ED of 8.1, improving to 4.1-->3.3 with fluids. Unclear etiology but
   most likely source at this point appears pulmonary, either viral or
   bacterial. Given antecedent URI type sxs and sick contact, flu can't be
   ruled out. Other sources of shock are less likely, including
   cardiogenic (PE not c/w this, sats ok on minimal O2), hypovolemic, or
   neurogenic shock. An endocrinopathy should also be ruled out.
   -- will cover potential pulm source with HAP PNA antibiotics
   (Vanc/Zosyn)
   -- sputum sample contaminated
   -- blood cultures, urine cultures are unrevealing
   -- RRV panel negative for flu
   -- when CVP >12, titrate levophed to MAP >65
   -- random cortisol mid 20
s essentially rules out adrenal insufficiency
   -- TSH 3.5
   -- given unclear source, will obtain torso CT with contrast and renal
   ppx
   .
   # Hypoglycemia
 may be from ongoing sepsis, but contributions from
   medication effect and poor hepatic/renal clearance of oral
   hypoglycemics vs. impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis are also possible.
   --  continue D5NS
   -- continue prn amps of D50 for FSG <80
   -- f/u sulfonylurea level
   -- would consult endocrine, thoughts on eval for tumor or
   paraneoplastic syndrime
   .
   # Microcytic Anemia: severely microcytic with MCV 68, with 62 nRBCs on
   diff. Recent Fe studies did not reveal iron deficiency. On that
   admission there was also no evidence of hemolysis.
   -- appreciate heme consult, working up for thalassemia given Italian
   heritage
   -- f/u HgB electrophoresis, SPEP/UPEP
   -- nRBCs persistently elevated but could be c/w stress reaction
   -- lead level WNL
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: The patient has had chronically elevated LFTs and
   currently they are not significantly changed from prior. Felt likely
   secondary to congestive hepatopathy versus medication induced (was on
   amiodarone until recently). Hyperbilirubinemia is largely direct,
   indicating hepatic dysfunction instead of hemolysis
   -- appreciate liver consult, f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1205**], [**Last Name (un) 5861**], AMA, IgG, IgM,

   #. CRI - baseline Cr 1.1-1.5: Pt with Cr 1.4 on admission. A pre renal
   or ATN insult may develop given his hypotension, but currently there is
   no acute change.
   -- renally dose meds, renal ppx for CT scans

   #. CAD s/p MI: No evidence of ischemia on EKG. One set of enzymes were
   negative int he ED but pt never complained of any chest pain.
   -- CE negative x1.
   -- continue ASA, hold toprol and lisinopril
   -- d/c statin given LFTs
   -- monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. chronic systolic CHF: does not appear to be in florid decompensated
   CHF at this time. He reported only mild SOB, and CXR did not reveal
   evidence of pulmonary edema
   -- will order echo today
   -- check BNP.
   -- hold Toprol XL, lisinopril, and lasix given hypotension
   -- if concern for volume overload as a result of sepsis resuscitation,
   can consider lasix, morphine, nitro, BiPAP
   .
   # HypoNa 0 likely secondary to excessive hypotonic fluid
   administration; is total body overloaded
   -- will diurese as tolerated once septic picture improving
   #. A-fib. Pt is rate controlled with metoprolol and anti-coagulated on
   coumadin. Pt also has a pacer for tachy/brady.
   -- continue coumadin, trend INR daily
   -- holding BB for now given hypotension, can use IV prn if RVR

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 73 yoM with h/o CAD, systolic CHF (EF 20%), s/p pacer and
   ICD, presents with fever, hypoglycemia amd shock, possible sepsis.
   .
   #. Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with lactate peak
   in ED of 8.1, improving to 4.1-->3.3 with fluids. Unclear etiology but
   most likely source at this point appears pulmonary, either viral or
   bacterial. Given antecedent URI type sxs and sick contact, flu can't be
   ruled out. Other sources of shock are less likely, including
   cardiogenic (PE not c/w this, sats ok on minimal O2), hypovolemic, or
   neurogenic shock. An endocrinopathy should also be ruled out.
   -- will cover potential pulm source with HAP PNA antibiotics
   (Vanc/Zosyn)
   -- sputum smaple contaminated
   -- blood cultures, urine cultures are unrevealing
   -- RRV panel negative for flu
   -- when CVP >12, titrate levophed to MAP >65
   -- random cortisol mid 20
s essentially rules out adrenal insufficiency
   -- TSH 3.5
   .
   # Hypoglycemia - likely from ongoing sepsis, but contributions from
   medication effect and poor hepatic/renal clearance of oral
   hypoglycemics vs. impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis are also possible.
   -- continue D10 gtt with q1h FSG
   -- prn amps of D50 for FSG <80
   -- if not improving with resolution of sepsis, consider endocrine
   consult, eval for tumor or paraneoplastic syndrime
   .
   # Microcytic Anemia: severely microcytic with MCV 68, with 62 nRBCs on
   diff. Recent Fe studies did not reveal iron deficiency. On that
   admission there was also no evidence of hemolysis.
   -- nRBCs persistently elevated but could be c/w stress reaction
   -- check lead level
   -- consider heme consult
   #. CAD s/p MI: No evidence of ischemia on EKG. One set of enzymes were
   negative int he ED but pt never complained of any chest pain.
   -- CE negative x1.
   -- continue ASA and statin, hold toprol and lisinopril
   -- monitor telemetry
   .
   #. chronic systolic CHF: does not appear to be in florid decompensated
   CHF at this time. He reported only mild SOB, and CXR did not reveal
   evidence of pulmonary edema.
   -- hold Toprol XL, lisinopril, and lasix given hypotension
   -- if concern for volume overload as a result of sepsis resuscitation,
   can consider morphine, nitro, BiPAP
   .
   #. A-fib. Pt is rate controlled with metoprolol and anti-coagulated on
   coumadin. Pt also has a pacer for tachy/brady.
   -- continue coumadin, trend INR daily
   -- holding BB for now given hypotension, can use IV prn if RVR
   .
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: The patient has had chronically elevated LFTs and
   currently they are not significantly changed from prior. Felt likely
   secondary to congestive hepatopathy versus medication induced (was on
   amiodarone until recently)
   -- Prior RUQ U/S significant only for top-normal size spleen.
   -- prior abdominal CT w/ contrast unrevealing
   -- check hepatitis serologies, iron studies; no evidence f EtOH abuse
   -- fractionate bilirubin
   -- consult liver for help with diagnosing this problem, ? biopsy needed
   .
   #. CRI - baseline Cr 1.1-1.5: Pt with Cr 1.4 on admission. A pre renal
   or ATN insult may develop given his hypotension, but currently there is
   no acute change.

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presents with fever, hypoglycemia, and shock, possible sepsis. 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications including:

1. Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with lactate levels improving after fluid resuscitation.
2. Hypoglycemia - likely from ongoing sepsis, but also possibly due to medication effect and poor hepatic/renal clearance of oral hypoglycemics.
3. Microcytic anemia - severely microcytic with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 68, with 62 nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs) on the differential. Recent iron studies did not reveal iron deficiency.
4. Chronic systolic CHF - does not appear to be in florid decompensated CHF at this time.
5. Atrial fibrillation - rate controlled with metoprolol and anticoagulated on coumadin.
6. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) - likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy or medication-induced.
7. Chronic kidney disease (CRI) - baseline creatinine (Cr) 1.1-1.5, with a current Cr level of 1.4.
8. Type II diabetes mellitus (DM) - currently hypoglycemic.
9. Hypertension - baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) 100-110.
10. Asthma/COPD - continue nebulizer treatments (nebs).
11. Gout - continue allopurinol.

The patient is receiving multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) for potential pulmonary source of infection, Heparin sodium for prophylaxis, Dextrose 50% for glycemic control, and other medications for various conditions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 151/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.14 mcg/kg/min and remains on pressors. 

The patient's lab results show elevated lactate levels, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated platelet count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and other abnormalities. The chest X-ray shows little change, with opacification in both lower lungs, possibly consistent with atelectasis and small effusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, development of acute kidney injury (AKI), progression of heart failure, exacerbation of diabetes mellitus, and further deterioration of liver function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presents with fever, hypoglycemia, and shock, possible sepsis. The patient's condition is unstable, and multiple medical complications are being managed simultaneously.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with lactate peak in ED of 8.1, improving to 4.1-->3.3 with fluids. Unclear etiology but most likely source at this point appears pulmonary, either viral or bacterial.
2. Hypoglycemia - may be from ongoing sepsis, medication effect, or impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis.
3. Microcytic Anemia - severely microcytic with MCV 68, with 62 nRBCs on diff. Recent Fe studies did not reveal iron deficiency.
4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs) - likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy versus medication-induced.
5. Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRI) - baseline Cr 1.1-1.5: Pt with Cr 1.4 on admission.
6. CAD s/p MI - no evidence of ischemia on EKG.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with h/o CHF, CKD, AF, and COPD presenting with fever,
   weakness, hypotension and persistent hypoglycemia in the setting of 8
   months of subacute/chronic decline characterized by weakness and
   recurrent falls.
   Shock:  Given fever in ED and rising WBC, concern if for septic
   etiology.  His warm extremities argue against cardiogenic shock despite
   low EF.  Sources for sepsis include pneumonia, skin infections.  No
   clear abdominal complaints.
     -Wean levophed to off as able but have low threshold for keeping on
   to maintain GFR
     -F/u sputum/Blood cultures.  Send stool for C diff.  Will hold on
   empiric coverage given lack of GI symptoms.
     -Reasonable to continue empiric broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for
   now
     -Monitor urine output and volume challenge as needed.
     -Check Abd/Chest CT and premedicate with NAC, IV bicarb
    Hypoglycemia:  Possibly multifactorial including impaired clearance of
   oral hypoglycemics +/- sepsis +/- impaired gluconeogenesis.  Other
   possibilities given his chronic history insulinoma vs paraneoplastic
   syndrome.
     -Continue D5NS for now
     -F/u sulfonylurea level
     -Check C-peptide level, endocrine consult.
    Anemia:  Microcytic with numerous nucleated RBC seen on diff.  Repeat
   diff still with increased nucleated RBCs.  Appreciate Heme input.
     -Hb electrophoresis, SPEP/UPEP/lead level pending
     -Pending above results will discuss any need for BM Bx with heme.
    Elevated LFT's:  Appears to be a chronic problem.  [**Name (NI) 317**] had normal
   imaging recently.  Negative viral panel in [**2178-6-11**].  Could be as
   simple as congestive hepatopathy but unlikely to explain decline over 8
   months without significant drop in EF.  Some concern that
   gluconeogenesis may be related to current hypoglycemia.  Tylenol level
   negative but drawn after he had been in the hospital for many hours.
     -Appreciate liver input, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-smooth, anti-mitochondrial, A1AT,
   ceruloplasmin pending
   Hyponatremia:  In the setting of getting large amounts of D5W
   yesterday.  Now switched to D5NS
     -Trend sodiums today
     - [**Month (only) 60**] need renal input given large obligate volume need for low
   sugars. ? need for HD to help with clearance of glyburide
    Lactic Acidosis:  Resolved now.  Either related to shock/hypoperfusion
   or to metformin.
    CHF:  Holding lasix, Toprol, ACE-I at present., recheck echo today
    AF:  Will hold coumadin in case any biopsies (bone marrow, liver etc)
   are needed. If INR continues to trend up, will give Vitamin K.  BB on
   hold

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with fever, weakness, hypotension, and persistent hypoglycemia. The patient's condition has been declining over the past 8 months, characterized by weakness and recurrent falls.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's fever and rising white blood cell count suggest a possible septic etiology. Sources of infection could include pneumonia, skin infections, or others. The patient's warm extremities argue against cardiogenic shock, despite low ejection fraction. Immediate management includes weaning off levophed if possible, monitoring urine output, and continuing empiric broad coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's persistent hypoglycemia may be multifactorial, including impaired clearance of oral hypoglycemics, sepsis, or impaired gluconeogenesis. Other possibilities include insulinoma or paraneoplastic syndrome. Management includes continuing dextrose infusion, checking sulfonylurea levels, and considering an endocrine consult.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with h/o CHF, CKD, AF, and COPD presenting with fever,
   weakness, hypotension and persistent hypoglycemia in the setting of 8
   months of subacute/chronic decline characterized by weakness and
   recurrent falls.
   Shock:  Given fever in ED and rising WBC, concern if for septic
   etiology.  His warm extremities argue against cardiogenic shock despite
   low EF.  Sources for sepsis include pneumonia, skin infections.  No
   clear abdominal complaints.
     -Wean levophed to off as able but have low threshold for keeping on
   to maintain GFR
     -F/u sputum/Blood cultures.  Send stool for C diff.  Will hold on
   empiric coverage given lack of GI symptoms.
     -Reasonable to continue empiric broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for
   now
     -Monitor urine output and volume challenge as needed.
     -Check Abd/Chest CT and premedicate with NAC, IV bicarb
    Hypoglycemia:  Possibly multifactorial including impaired clearance of
   oral hypoglycemics +/- sepsis +/- impaired gluconeogenesis.  Other
   possibilities given his chronic history insulinoma vs paraneoplastic
   syndrome.
     -Continue D5NS for now
     -F/u sulfonylurea level
     -Check C-peptide level, endocrine consult.
    Anemia:  Microcytic with numerous nucleated RBC seen on diff.  Repeat
   diff still with increased nucleated RBCs.  Appreciate Heme input.
     -Hb electrophoresis, SPEP/UPEP/lead level pending
     -Pending above results will discuss any need for BM Bx with heme.
    Elevated LFT's:  Appears to be a chronic problem.  [**Name (NI) 317**] had normal
   imaging recently.  Negative viral panel in [**2178-6-11**].  Could be as
   simple as congestive hepatopathy.  Some concern that gluconeogenesis
   may be related to current hypoglycemia.  Tylenol level negative but
   drawn after he had been in the hospital for many hours.
     -Appreciate liver input, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-smooth, anti-mitochondrial, A1AT,
   ceruloplasmin pending
   Hyponatremia:  In the setting of getting large amounts of D5W
   yesterday.  Now switched to D5NS
     -Trend sodiums today
    Lactic Acidosis:  Resolved now.  Either related to shock/hypoperfusion
   or to metformin.
    CHF:  Holding lasix, Toprol, ACE-I at present.
    AF:  Will hold coumadin in case any biopsies (bone marrow, liver etc)
   are needed. If INR continues to trend up, will give Vitamin K.  BB on
   hold

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with fever, weakness, hypotension, and persistent hypoglycemia. The assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications:

1. Shock: There is a concern for septic shock given the fever in the emergency department and rising white blood cell count. The patient's warm extremities argue against cardiogenic shock despite low ejection fraction. Sources of sepsis could include pneumonia or skin infections. 

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's persistent hypoglycemia is possibly multifactorial, including impaired clearance of oral hypoglycemics, sepsis, or impaired gluconeogenesis. Other possibilities include insulinoma or paraneoplastic syndrome.

3. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia with numerous nucleated red blood cells seen on the blood smear. Repeat differentials still show increased nucleated RBCs. A hematology consult is recommended.

4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The elevated LFTs appear to be a chronic problem. It could be as simple as congestive hepatopathy. Some concern exists that gluconeogenesis may be related to current hypoglycemia.

5. Hyponatremia:"

   .
   #. Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with lactate peak
   in ED of 8.1, improving to 4.1-->3.3 with fluids. Unclear etiology but
   most likely source at this point appears pulmonary, either viral or
   bacterial. Given antecedent URI type sxs and sick contact, flu can't be
   ruled out. Other sources of shock are less likely, including
   cardiogenic (PE not c/w this, sats ok on minimal O2), hypovolemic, or
   neurogenic shock. An endocrinopathy should also be ruled out.
   -- continue to  cover potential pulm source with HAP PNA antibiotics

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presents with fever, hypoglycemia, and shock, possibly septic. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including right-sided heart failure, microcytic anemia, chronic renal insufficiency, chronic systolic CHF, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), asthma/COPD, gout, and hyperbilirubinemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with improving lactate levels.
2. Right-sided heart failure - moderate-to-severe reflux of administered contrast into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and hepatic veins.
3. Microcytic anemia - severely microcytic with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 68, and 62 nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs) on differential.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency - baseline creatinine (Cr) 1.1-1.5, with a current Cr level of 1.4.
5. Chronic systolic CHF - EF 25% with 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR).
6. Type II DM - hypogly"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 73 yoM with h/o CAD, systolic CHF (EF 20%), s/p pacer and
   ICD, presents with fever, hypoglycemia amd shock, possible sepsis.
   .
   #. Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with lactate peak
   in ED of 8.1, improving to 4.1-->3.3 with fluids. Unclear etiology but
   most likely source at this point appears pulmonary, either viral or
   bacterial. Given antecedent URI type sxs and sick contact, flu can't be
   ruled out. Other sources of shock are less likely, including
   cardiogenic (PE not c/w this, sats ok on minimal O2), hypovolemic, or
   neurogenic shock. An endocrinopathy should also be ruled out.
   -- will cover potential pulm source with HAP PNA antibiotics
   (Vanc/Zosyn)
   -- sputum sample contaminated
   -- blood cultures, urine cultures are unrevealing
   -- RRV panel negative for flu
   -- when CVP >12, titrate levophed to MAP >65
   -- random cortisol mid 20
s essentially rules out adrenal insufficiency
   -- TSH 3.5
   -- given unclear source, will obtain torso CT with contrast and renal
   ppx
   .
   # Hypoglycemia
 may be from ongoing sepsis, but contributions from
   medication effect and poor hepatic/renal clearance of oral
   hypoglycemics vs. impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis are also possible.
   --  continue D5NS
   -- continue prn amps of D50 for FSG <80
   -- f/u sulfonylurea level
   -- would consult endocrine, thoughts on eval for tumor or
   paraneoplastic syndrime
   .
   # Microcytic Anemia: severely microcytic with MCV 68, with 62 nRBCs on
   diff. Recent Fe studies did not reveal iron deficiency. On that
   admission there was also no evidence of hemolysis.
   -- appreciate heme consult, working up for thalassemia given Italian
   heritage
   -- f/u HgB electrophoresis, SPEP/UPEP
   -- nRBCs persistently elevated but could be c/w stress reaction
   -- lead level WNL
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: The patient has had chronically elevated LFTs and
   currently they are not significantly changed from prior. Felt likely
   secondary to congestive hepatopathy versus medication induced (was on
   amiodarone until recently). Hyperbilirubinemia is largely direct,
   indicating hepatic dysfunction instead of hemolysis
   -- appreciate liver consult, f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1205**], [**Last Name (un) 5861**], AMA, IgG, IgM,

   -- no evidence f EtOH abuse
   -- will d.c statin
   -- Prior RUQ U/S significant only for top-normal size spleen.
   -- prior abdominal CT w/ contrast unrevealing
   .
   #. CRI - baseline Cr 1.1-1.5: Pt with Cr 1.4 on admission. A pre renal
   or ATN insult may develop given his hypotension, but currently there is
   no acute change.
   -- renally dose meds, renal ppx for CT scans
   -- trend Cr
   -- no need for ulytes or sono given that yesterday
s PM labs with Cr
   0.9 are in error, GFR at baseline currently
   -- f/u renal sono
   .
   #. CAD s/p MI: No evidence of ischemia on EKG. One set of enzymes were
   negative int he ED but pt never complained of any chest pain.
   -- CE negative x1.
   -- continue ASA, hold toprol and lisinopril
   -- d/c statin given LFTs
   -- monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. chronic systolic CHF: does not appear to be in florid decompensated
   CHF at this time. He reported only mild SOB, and CXR did not reveal
   evidence of pulmonary edema
   -- will order echo today
   -- check BNP.
   -- hold Toprol XL, lisinopril, and lasix given hypotension
   -- if concern for volume overload as a result of sepsis resuscitation,
   can consider lasix, morphine, nitro, BiPAP
   .
   # HypoNa 0 likely secondary to excessive hypotonic fluid
   administration; is total body overloaded
   -- will diurese as tolerated once septic picture improving
   #. A-fib. Pt is rate controlled with metoprolol and anti-coagulated on
   coumadin. Pt also has a pacer for tachy/brady.
   -- continue coumadin, trend INR daily
   -- holding BB for now given hypotension, can use IV prn if RVR
   # Type II DM: pt currently hypoglycemic
   -- hold oral hypoglycemics
   -- f/u sulfonylurea level
   -- check A1c
   -- FSG QIDACHS, cover with ISS when hypoglycemia resolves

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with fever, weakness, hypotension, and persistent hypoglycemia. The patient has been experiencing a decline in health over the past 8 months characterized by weakness and recurrent falls. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's clinical scenario is becoming more concerning for cardiogenic shock. His cardiac output is likely very limited, as indicated by the 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram. Dopamine trial will be attempted today with diuretic support, and central venous saturation, lactates, and urine output will be monitored.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory status is limited by cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and abdominal distention. Diuretics will be continued, and a trial of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) will be considered.
3. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): There has been a large increase in LFTs today, which may be due to congestive hepatopathy or shock liver due to poor cardiac output. An inotrope trial will be attempted, and Vitamin K will be administered"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with fever, weakness, hypotension, and persistent hypoglycemia. The patient's condition has been declining over the past 8 months, characterized by weakness and recurrent falls. He is currently in the ICU and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's clinical scenario suggests cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by the low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% and 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). This indicates that his cardiac output is likely very limited.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory status is limited by cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and abdominal distention. Diuretic therapy with lasix drip and non-invasive positive airway pressure (BiPAP) may be necessary to manage these conditions.
3. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has experienced a large increase in LFTs, which could be due to congestive hepatopathy caused by right-sided heart failure or shock liver due to poor cardiac output. An inotropic trial and vitamin K administration may be needed.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's persistent hypoglycemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 73 yoM with h/o CAD, systolic CHF (EF 20%), s/p pacer and
   ICD, presents with fever, hypoglycemia amd shock, possible sepsis.
   #. Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with lactate peak
   in ED of 8.1, improving to 4.1-->3.3 with fluids. Unclear etiology but
   most likely source at this point appears pulmonary, either viral or
   bacterial. Given antecedent URI type sxs and sick contact, flu can't be
   ruled out. Other sources of shock are less likely, including
   cardiogenic (PE not c/w this, sats ok on minimal O2), hypovolemic, or
   neurogenic shock. An endocrinopathy should also be ruled out.
   -- continue to  cover potential pulm source with HAP PNA antibiotics
   (Vanc/Zosyn)
   -- blood cultures, urine cultures are unrevealing, sputum contaminated
   -- RRV panel negative for flu
   -- CT torso w/ contrast unrevealing for acute sepsis source or
   malignancy
   -- titrate down levophed to MAP >65
   -- consider dobutamine given EF 25% and e/o poor effective
   circulation/perfusion by physical exam
   -- random cortisol mid 20
s essentially rules out adrenal
   insufficiency, and TSH 3.5
   # Elevated LFTs: Acute rise in AST/ALT to 1000s. Ruled out for tylenol
   and viral etiologies. [**Month (only) 60**] be attributable to shock in the setting of
   sepsis.
   -- appreciate liver consult, f/u additional recs
   -- in setting of possible shock liver, would strongly consider
   dobutamine to increase cardiac output

   -- hepatitis serologies and iron studies negative
   -- Hyperbilirubinemia is largely direct, indicating hepatic dysfunction
   instead of hemolysis
   -- no evidence f EtOH abuse
   -- Prior RUQ U/S significant only for top-normal size spleen.
   -- would give 5mg vitamin K as unclear what is residual coumadin and
   what is liver dz
   # Hypoglycemia
 Improving. [**Month (only) 60**] be from ongoing sepsis, but
   contributions from medication effect and poor hepatic/renal clearance
   of oral hypoglycemics vs. impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis are also
   possible.
   -- appreciate endocrine recs, likely from sepsis and prolonged effect
   of sulfonylureas
   --  continue D10NS
   -- continue prn amps of D50 for FSG <80
   -- f/u sulfonylurea level, C-peptide, insulin level
   # Microcytic Anemia: severely microcytic with MCV 68, with 62 nRBCs on
   diff. Recent Fe studies did not reveal iron deficiency. On that
   admission there was also no evidence of hemolysis.

   -- BNP 13.300, well above baseline
   -- avoid diuresesis if possible today given spike in LFTs, support BP

   -- hold Toprol XL, lisinopril, and lasix given hypotension
   -- if concern for severe volume overload as a result of sepsis
   resuscitation, can consider lasix, morphine, nitro, BiPAP

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), and previous pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented with fever, hypoglycemia, and shock, possible sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 126 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula, and temperature of 36.7°C. The patient's physical examination revealed tiredness, difficult to rouse, irregular heart rhythm, expiratory wheezing with crackles at the bases, obesity, soft abdomen, anasarca with scrotal edema, and chronic eschars and ulcerations on the hand and feet. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate levels, and low platelet count. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to a pulmonary source, possibly viral or bacterial. He has also been diagnosed with hypoglycemia, microcytic anemia, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's medical conditions include acute kidney injury, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, chronic systolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma/COPD"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and previous placement of a pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presents with fever, hypoglycemia, and shock, possibly septic. The etiology of the shock is unclear, but most likely pulmonary. The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible shock liver. He also has microcytic anemia, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), chronic systolic CHF, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), asthma/COPD, and gout. His current medications include dobutamine, furosemide (Lasix), norepinephrine, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to poor forward flow and low EF.
2. Sepsis-related complications such as organ dysfunction, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
3. Hepatic dysfunction due to shock liver or underlying liver disease.
4. Hypoglycemia from excessive insulin administration or impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis.
5. Microcytic anemia may require further investigation for causes other than iron deficiency, such as thalassemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with h/o CHF, CKD, AF, and COPD presenting with fever,
   weakness, hypotension and persistent hypoglycemia in the setting of 8
   months of subacute/chronic decline characterized by weakness and
   recurrent falls.
   Shock:  Clinical scenario more concerning for cardiogenic shock.
   Although EF is not significantly different from before, 3+ MR suggests
   that his cardiac output is probably very limited.
     -Will continue with dobutamine and lasix drip for now.  Unfortunately
   his dyspnea is requiring increasing doses of morphine.  If edema is not
   improved, it is likely that he will not be able to return home but
   would instead pass away in the hospital.
     -Reasonable to continue empiric broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for
   now
     -Appreciate Dr.[**Name (NI) 7653**] input
   Hypoxemia:  Respiratory status limited by cardiogenic pulmonary edema,
   pleural effusions, and abdominal distention
     -Diuresis as above with lasix drip
     -Continue morphine PRN for comfort
    Elevated LFT's:  Concern for both congestive hepatopathy and now shock
   liver due to poor cardiac output. LFT's trending down today with
   inotropes.
     -Continue to trend for now..
    Hypoglycemia:  Blood sugars now normal off sugar infusions.  Likely
   related to med effect/poor clearance.
   Anticoagulation:  Received Vitamin K yesterday,  INR still 4.4.  No
   plans for FFP to avoid volume.
    Renal:  Maintaining reasonable GFR
     -Monitor urine output as above, goal is net negative today.
    AF:  Holding BB,  if HR becomes an issue with dopamine will consider
   amiodarone.  Coumadin to hold for now.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with fever, weakness, hypotension, and persistent hypoglycemia, and has been experiencing a decline in health characterized by weakness and recurrent falls over the past 8 months.

The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, as indicated by clinical signs such as tachycardia, low blood pressure, and poor cardiac output. The patient's respiratory status is limited by cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and abdominal distention.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs), hypoglycemia, and abnormal coagulation parameters. The LFTs are trending down with the use of inotropes. The patient's renal function is being monitored, and efforts are being made to maintain a reasonable glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically for potential infections. The plan is to continue dobutamine and lasix infusions to improve cardiac output and reduce fluid overload. Morphine is being used for comfort due to the patient's dyspnea.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cardiogenic shock, respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema or pleural effusions, further deterioration"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with h/o CHF, CKD, AF, and COPD presenting with fever,
   weakness, hypotension and persistent hypoglycemia in the setting of 8
   months of subacute/chronic decline characterized by weakness and
   recurrent falls.
   Shock:  Clinical scenario more concerning for cardiogenic shock.
   Although EF is not significantly different from before, 3+ MR suggests
   that his cardiac output is probably very limited.
     -Will continue with dobutamine and lasix drip for now.  Unfortunately
   his dyspnea is requiring increasing doses of morphine.  If edema is not
   improved, it is likely that he will not be able to return home but
   would instead pass away in the hospital.
     -Reasonable to continue empiric broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for
   now
     -Appreciate Dr.[**Name (NI) 7653**] input
   Hypoxemia:  Respiratory status limited by cardiogenic pulmonary edema,
   pleural effusions, and abdominal distention
     -Diuresis as above with lasix drip
     -Continue morphine PRN for comfort
    Elevated LFT's:  Concern for both congestive hepatopathy and now shock
   liver due to poor cardiac output. LFT's trending down today with
   inotropes.
     -Continue to trend for now..
    Hypoglycemia:  Blood sugars now normal off sugar infusions.  Likely
   related to med effect/poor clearance.
   Anticoagulation:  Received Vitamin K yesterday,  INR still 4.4.  No
   plans for FFP to avoid volume.
    Renal:  Maintaining reasonable GFR
     -Monitor urine output as above, goal is net negative today.
    AF:  Holding BB,  if HR becomes an issue with dopamine will consider
   amiodarone.  Coumadin to hold for now.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with fever, weakness, hypotension, and persistent hypoglycemia. The patient has been experiencing a subacute/chronic decline characterized by weakness and recurrent falls.

The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by his clinical scenario and the presence of 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). His cardiac output is very limited, and he is not responding well to dobutamine and lasix drips. He requires increasing doses of morphine for dyspnea.

The patient has been empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) to cover for potential infections. His respiratory status is limited by cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and abdominal distention. Diuretics are being used to manage these conditions.

The patient also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which may be due to congestive hepatopathy or shock liver. His blood sugars were initially low but have now normalized off sugar infusions.

Anticoagulation with Coumadin is being held due to the patient's elevated INR. The patient's renal function is being monitored, and efforts are being made to maintain a reasonable glomerular filtration"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), and previous pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. He presents with fever, hypoglycemia, and shock, possibly sepsis. The patient is currently on dobutamine and levophed drips for cardiogenic shock, with ongoing coverage for potential pulmonary source of sepsis. Blood cultures are negative, and sputum is contaminated. The patient's right lung consolidation has worsened, and there is evidence of pulmonary edema. His heart size is big, and bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: Etiology septic vs cardiogenic. WBC elevated, although clinical picture more consistent with cardiogenic shock.
- Continue to cover potential pulmonary source with HAP PNA antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn).
- Blood cultures, urine cultures are unrevealing, sputum contaminated.
- CT torso with contrast unrevealing for acute sepsis source or malignancy.
- Continue on levophed and dobutamine given EF 25% and e/o poor effective circulation/perfusion by physical exam.
- Cardiology consult scheduled.
- Random cortisol mid 20 essentially rules out adrenal insufficiency.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presenting with fever, weakness, hypotension, and persistent hypoglycemia. The patient has been experiencing a decline in health characterized by weakness and recurrent falls over the past 8 months.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac output is likely very limited due to the presence of 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). The goal is to continue with dobutamine and lasix drip to improve pulmonary edema and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) about 60 for appropriate afterload.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory status is limited by cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and abdominal distention. Diuresis with lasix drip and continuing morphine PRN for comfort are recommended to manage this condition.

3. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated, which could be related to congestive hepatopathy or shock liver due to poor cardiac output. Monitoring the trend of LFTs is important, and inotropes may help improve liver function.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced hypoglycemia, which may be related"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 73 yoM with h/o CAD, systolic CHF (EF 20%), s/p pacer and
   ICD, presents with fever, hypoglycemia amd shock, possible sepsis.
   #. Shock: Etiology septic vs cardiogenic.  WBC elevated, although
   clinicial picture more consistent with cardiogenic shock.  Currently on
   both levophed and dobutamine.  Tachycardic on the dobutamine.  If
   sepsis, pulm source most likely, all other cultures have been
   negative.    Per fam mtg, pt prefers to be discharged home with
   hospice.
   -- continue to  cover potential pulm source with HAP PNA antibiotics
   (Vanc/Zosyn)
   -- blood cultures, urine cultures are unrevealing, sputum contaminated
   -- RRV panel negative for flu
   -- CT torso w/ contrast unrevealing for acute sepsis source or
   malignancy
   -- levophed now off, will try to wean dobutamine off overnight in
   preparation of discharge home with hospice
   -- random cortisol mid 20
s essentially rules out adrenal
   insufficiency, and TSH 3.5
   # Elevated LFTs: Acute rise in AST/ALT to 1000s, but then came down
   slightly. Ruled out for tylenol and viral etiologies. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   attributable to shock in the setting of sepsis.
   -- appreciate liver consult, f/u additional recs
   -- in setting of possible shock liver, on dobutamine gtt, but will wean
   given pt's goal of home with hospice
   -- f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1205**], [**Last Name (un) 5861**], AMA
   -- IgG, IgM WNL
   -- hepatitis serologies and iron studies negative
   -- Hyperbilirubinemia is largely direct, indicating hepatic dysfunction
   instead of hemolysis
   -- no evidence of EtOH abuse
   -- Prior RUQ U/S significant only for top-normal size spleen.
   -- received vitamin K with some improvement in INR
   # Hypoglycemia
 resolved. Likely was due to sepsis, but contributions
   from medication effect and poor hepatic/renal clearance of oral
   hypoglycemics vs. impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis are also possible.
   -- appreciate endocrine recs, likely from sepsis and prolonged effect
   of sulfonylureas
   -- off dextrose gtt
   -- continue prn amps of D50 for FSG <80
   -- f/u sulfonylurea level, C-peptide, insulin level
   # Microcytic Anemia: severely microcytic with MCV 68, with 62 nRBCs on
   diff. Recent Fe studies did not reveal iron deficiency. On that
   admission there was also no evidence of hemolysis.
   -- appreciate heme consult, working up for thalassemia given Italian
   heritage, f/u HgB electropheresis
   -- f/u HgB electrophoresis, SPEP WNL, f/u UPEP
   -- nRBCs persistently elevated but could be c/w stress reaction
   -- lead level WNL
   #. CRI - baseline Cr 1.1-1.5: Pt with Cr 1.4 on admission. A pre renal
   or ATN insult may develop given his hypotension, but currently there is
   no acute change.
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr
   -- GFR at baseline currently
   -- renal sono: no hydronephrosis
   #. CAD s/p MI: No evidence of ischemia on EKG. One set of enzymes were
   negative int he ED but pt never complained of any chest pain.
   -- CE negative x1.
   -- continue ASA, hold toprol and lisinopril
   -- d/c statin given LFTs
   -- monitor on telemetry
   #. chronic systolic CHF: does not appear to be in florid decompensated
   CHF at this time. He reported only mild SOB, and CXR did not reveal
   evidence of pulmonary edema
   -- echo shows EF 25% with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
   -- BNP 13.300, well above baseline
   -- on lasix gtt, support BP with dobutamine (although trying to wean)
   -- hold Toprol XL, lisinopril, given hypotension
   # HypoNa
 Improving, likely secondary to excessive hypotonic fluid
   administration; is total body overloaded
   -- will diurese as tolerated
   #. A-fib. Pt is rate controlled with metoprolol and anti-coagulated on
   coumadin. Pt also has a pacer for tachy/brady.
   -- holding coumadin, but INR still therapeutic
   -- holding BB for now given hypotension, can use IV prn if RVR
   # Type II DM: pt currently hypoglycemic
   -- hold oral hypoglycemics
   -- gentle sliding scale
   -- f/u sulfonylurea level, CPEP, insulin leves
   -- check A1c

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), and previous placement of a pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presents with fever, hypoglycemia, and shock, possible sepsis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 112/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is being treated for shock, possibly due to sepsis or cardiogenic causes. He is receiving both levophed and dobutamine infusions. Blood cultures have been negative, so a pulmonary source of infection is suspected. Antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) are being continued to cover potential pulmonary infection.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are significantly elevated but have improved slightly. This could be due to shock in the setting of sepsis. A liver consult has been appreciated.

The patient also has hypoglycemia, which has resolved. It was likely due to sepsis, medication effects, and poor hepatic/renal clearance of oral hypoglycemics versus impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis. Endocrine recommendations are being followed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of attempted diuresis using Lasix and Diuril. The patient was previously on Levophed and dobutamine, but has been weaned off both medications. The patient's wife expressed concerns about caring for the patient at home and is considering transferring care to hospital hospice.

   This is a 73 yom with h/o CAD, systolic CHF (EF 20%) s/p pacer and ICD
   who was admitted for fever, hypoglycemia and shock.  Now transitioning
   to CMO
 COMFORT CARE (CMO, COMFORT MEASURES):  Several meetings have been
   done over the weekend and the final decision has been made to
   transition to CMO.  The wife initially wanted to take the husband home
   with home hospice, however, the wife called yesterday and admitted that
   she could not take care of her husband at home on her own.  Therefore,
   we will transition to inpatient hospice.   All unnecessary medications
   will be discontinued.  Focus will be on comfort care at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and previous pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He was admitted for fever, hypoglycemia, and shock. The patient is currently transitioning to comfort care measures (CMO) after meetings with the family and medical team. The wife initially wanted to take the husband home with home hospice, but admitted she could not care for him alone. Therefore, the decision has been made to transition to inpatient hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of systolic congestive heart failure and is currently on comfort measures. This increases the risk of respiratory failure due to fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous ICD placement. Even though the ICD is in place, there is still a risk of cardiac arrest due to the underlying heart condition.
3. Infection: The patient had a fever during admission, indicating a possible infection. In the comfort care setting, the patient may be more susceptible to infections due to compromised immunity.
4. Organ Failure: The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and elevated lactic acid levels, which could indicate organ dysfunction. This could further compromise the patient's overall condition.
5. Bleeding: The patient's PT/PTT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presenting with fever, weakness, hypotension, and persistent hypoglycemia. The patient's condition has been declining over the past 8 months, characterized by weakness and recurrent falls. The patient's wife is also experiencing emotional distress due to the patient's decline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating possible inadequate perfusion to vital organs.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are consistently below normal, which can lead to neurological complications if not promptly addressed.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, which may increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's kidney function is compromised, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
5. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, indicating a possible exacerbation of COPD.
6. Infection: The patient's fever suggests an underlying infection, which needs to be identified and treated promptly.
7. Emotional Distress: The patient's wife is at risk of emotional decompensation due to the patient's declining health, requiring close attention and support.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's persistent low blood sugar levels may increase the risk of neurological complications or even coma.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of AF, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potentially lead to stroke or other cardiovascular complications.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's pre-existing CKD may worsen due to decreased renal perfusion caused by hypotension or other underlying conditions.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD and current unresponsive state may"
