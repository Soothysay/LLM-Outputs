   24 Hour Events:
   71-year-old woman with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy with
   severe left ventricular dysfunction with LVEF of 10%, atrial
   fibrillation, [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD, CKD, with past history of DVT, PE on Coumadin,
   s/p IVC filter who presents from rehab with increasing dyspnea
   overnight. The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 54**] CCU on [**9-22**]
   for CHF exacerbation and was discharged to rehab facility. Since that
   time, patient was hospitalized at [**Location (un) 108**] two weeks ago for pneumonia
   and ascites (6L drained)and discharged back to rehab.
   .
   She saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2179-10-18**] as an outpatient for complaint of
   increasing dyspnea and had her dose of Torsemide increased from 20mg to
   40mg and Carvedilol was discontinued and switched to Metoprolol
   tartrate 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  Despite these changes, she reports increasing
   dyspnea with exertion. At baseline, patient is unable to perform ADLs
   without the assistance and there has been a noticible worsening in her
   physical limitations in the last week.
   .
   On the day of admission, she was started on azithromycin by the
   cardiology NP for concern for URI. She was taken to [**Hospital 108**] hospital
   for initial evaluation and was given another dose of torsemide 40mg x 1
   and then transferred to [**Hospital1 54**]. Patient's initial VS in the ED were 98.3
   76 105/70 16 96 on 4LNC. Pt was initially dyspneic, RR in 20s, wheezes
   bilaterally. Ascities worse than in past few weeks and 2+ pedal edema.
   .
   She was admitted overnight to the [**Hospital1 2259**] service and started on a lasix
   gtt at 10cc/hr and given metolazone 5mg x1 with 300cc + foley leakage
   of output. She diuresed 1L negative. Metoprolol was held given BP
   concerns. A RUQ Us was performed this am for further evaluation of
   ascites and LFT elevations. In for LENIs this am as well. VS on the
   floor 97.7 70 109/69 20 96% on 4L.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for presence of chest pain at
   rehab but none on the floor, dyspnea on exertion in the past week. She
   denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea but has endorsed
   increased lower extremity edema. No palpitations, syncope or
   presyncope.
   .
   On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
   bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis,
   black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
   She reports feeling nasal congestion, postnasal drip, and cough
   productive of green phlegm.  All of the other review of systems were
   negative.

","The patient is a 71-year-old woman with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe left ventricular dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presents with increased dyspnea and is being treated with milrinone for acute on chronic decompensated systolic heart failure.

The patient has failed home therapy with torsemide and beta-blockers. She is volume overloaded, as evidenced by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral crackles on lung auscultation, ascites, and lower extremity edema. She is not responding to lasix and metolazone on the floor.

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows worsening mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure. The patient's ejection fraction is estimated to be 15-20%. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is paced with a bi-ventricular pacemaker.

The patient's coronary arteries show a mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) bare metal stent placed in the past, with troponin levels of 0.04 and CK-MB negative on presentation. Her baseline creatinine level was 2.3, and it is now 1.5. The etiology of CKD is unclear.

The patient also has ascites, likely due to right heart failure, and there is no history of liver disease in the past. She underwent a large volume paracentesis at an outside hospital a few weeks ago. A right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ US) suggests hepatic congestion as the likely etiology.

The patient was started on azithromycin empirically for possible sinusitis, but she remains afebrile with no white blood cell elevation and no infiltrate on admission chest X-ray. A gram stain of the sputum shows 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.

The patient has a history of DVT/PE, is on coumadin with therapeutic INR, and has a filter in place. She has significant lower extremity edema, which is likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). Lower extremity negative predictive indices (LENIs) have been negative from admission.

The patient has hypothyroidism and is to continue her home dose of levothyroxine.

The patient's diet is to be low in salt and heart-healthy, with fluid restriction of 1000cc/day. She has peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines and will be getting a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) for milrinone and pressors as needed.

Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation with coumadin for deep vein thrombosis ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10%-15%, atrial fibrillation, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and chronic kidney disease. She presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for administration of milrinone.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic decompenstated systolic heart failure, which is not responding to lasix and metolazone on the floor. She also has bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed worsening mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure.

The plan includes starting milrinone at a dose of 50mcg/kg/min followed by 0.375mcg/kg/min once the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line is placed. The dose will be titrated up to 0.75mcg/kg/min. Lasix will be continued at 12 mg/hour, and metolazone 2.5mg will be added. Digoxin will be continued, and spironolactone may be considered if blood pressure allows. Low-dose beta-blockers ("

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  71-year-old woman with advanced end-stage
   ischemic cardiomyopathy LVEF of 10%-15%, atrial fibrillation, [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD,
   chronic kidney disease with past history of DVT, PE on Coumadin
   presented with increased dyspnea and transferred to CCU for milrinone
   gtt.
   .
   # PUMP:  Advanced ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 15-20%, presents with
   acute on chronic decompenstated systolic heart failure. Has failed home
   therapy with torsemide, BB. Clearly volume up as evidenced by elevated
   BNP, elevated JVP, bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema.
   Not responding to lasix gtt and metolazone on the floor. Has BiV pacer.
   TTE repeated on admit shows worsening MR which may be causing pulm htn
   and subsequent right heart failure.
   - started Milrinone 50mcg/kg/min bolus then .375mcg/kg/min once PICC
   placed
   - continue lasix gtt at 10, add metolazone 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **], goal 3L negative
   daily
   - continue digoxin, consider adding spironolactone if BP can tolerate
   - continue low dose BB
   - prn neosynephrine for hypotension
   - f/u nuclear viability study
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with mid-LAD BMS '[**64**]. Trop 0.04, CK-MB negative
   on presentation.
   - complete r/o MI
   - continue aspirin, statin, BB
   .
   # RHYTHM: H/o Afib, Vpaced with BiV pacer.
   - continue amiodarone, BB
   .
   # CKD: Creatinine baseline on last admit 2.3, Creatinine 1.5 on
   presentation now. Etiology unclear.
   - likely need creatinine of mid 2 to achieve appropriate fluid status
   - lasix for diuresis
   - f/u urine cultures
   .
   # Ascites: RHF is presumed etiology. No history of liver disease in
   past. Did have large volume tap at OSH few weeks ago. RUQ US c/w
   hepatic congestion likely [**1-18**] RHF.
   - obtain OSH records of paracentesis procedure and fluid eval
   - would need to cover for SBP if becomes febrile or unstable
   .
   # ? URI prior to admit: Patient started on zithromax empirically for
   possible sinusitis. She remains afebrile with no WBC elevation and no
   infiltrate on admission CXR however gram stain shows 1+GPC in pairs and
   clusters.
   - start Vanc given recent hospitalizations
   - f/u sputum culture
   .
   # LFT Elevation - Most likely etiology is hepatic congestion from RHF
   although AP/Bili elevation raises question of obstructive etiology. RUQ
   US WNL so likely hepatic congestion.
   - trend LFTs with trial of milrinone to see if they improve
   - consider holding statin if they continue to trend up
   .
   # H/O DVT/PE - On coumadin with therapeutic INR, h/o filter placement.
   Has significant LE edema which is likely secondary to CHF. LENIs
   negative from admission.
   - continue coumadin for goal INR [**1-19**]
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   .
   FEN: Low salt, heart healthy diet, fluid restriction 1000cc/day.
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, getting PICC for milrinone and pressors prn

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10-15%, atrial fibrillation, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for milrinone infusion.

The patient has a history of DVT/PE, on Coumadin with therapeutic INR, and has undergone filter placement. She also has significant lower extremity edema, which is likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and her skin examination is also not performed.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 91/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically unstable with a high central venous pressure (CVP) and low blood pressure. She has a positive fluid balance of -3527 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral crackles on lung auscultation, ascites, and lower extremity edema. These findings suggest acute-on-chronic decompensated systolic heart failure (HF) with worsening mitral regurgitation (MR), leading to pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure.

The patient has been started on milrinone infusion, continuous Lasix gtt at 10, and metolazone 2.5 mg. She will continue with digoxin, consider adding spironolactone if blood pressure can tolerate, and low-dose beta-blockers (BB). Prn neosynephrine will be given for hypotension, and a follow-up nuclear viability study will be performed.

The patient's medical history also includes a mid-left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent (BMS) with troponin level of 0.04, CK-MB negative on presentation. Complete ruling out of myocardial infarction (MI) is necessary. Aspirin, statin, and BB therapy will be continued.

The patient is currently paced with a biventricular (BiV) pacemaker for atrial fibrillation (AFib). Amiodarone and BB will be continued.

The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) etiology is unclear, with a baseline creatinine of 2.3 on the last admission and a current creatinine level of 1.5. Lasix for diuresis and follow-up urine cultures are needed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF of 10%-15%, atrial fibrillation, ICD implantation, chronic kidney disease, and a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The patient presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for milrinone infusion.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic decompenstated systolic heart failure and has failed home therapy with torsemide and beta-blockers. She is volume overloaded as evidenced by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. The patient's renal function has improved from a baseline creatinine of 2.3 to 1.3.

She also has a history of hypothyroidism and is on levothyroxine. The patient's electrolytes show elevated potassium levels. She has undergone a nuclear viability study indicating potentially viable inferior myocardium. 

The patient's current medications include milrinone, furosemide (Lasix), omeprazole (Prilosec), digoxin, spironolactone, low-dose beta-blockers, and amiodarone. She is also on aspirin and a statin for coronary artery disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF of 10%-15%, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. She presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the CCU for milrinone infusion. The patient has a history of DVT, PE, and is on Coumadin. She also has a history of myocardial infarction, for which she underwent a viability test. The patient's current medications include omeprazole (Prilosec), digoxin, spironolactone, low-dose beta-blockers (BB), and amiodarone.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate (HR) of 70 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 83/43 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93% on nasal cannula. She is receiving milrinone and furosemide infusions. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.9 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 30.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 164 K/uL, blood glucose of 155 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 3.4 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 135 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3) of 24 mEq/L, BUN of 39 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 8.1 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.3 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) of 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of myocardial viability, with fixed defects in the distal anterior and apical walls consistent with scarring. An improvement of inferior wall defect with correction is suggestive of myocardial viability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Failure: The patient has advanced ischemic cardiomyopathy and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), indicating a high risk of cardiac failure. The current symptoms of increased dyspnea and fluid overload suggest worsening of her cardiac condition.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and her oxygen saturation is below the normal range. This could be due to pulmonary congestion caused by heart failure or an underlying respiratory infection.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level. The creatinine level is within normal limits,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy and a low ejection fraction of 10%-15%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic kidney disease, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for administration of milrinone, a medication used to improve heart function. The patient's condition is described as acute on chronic decompenstated systolic heart failure, with symptoms including elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. The patient has failed home therapy with torsemide and beta-blockers (BB). 

Further evaluation revealed worsening mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which may be causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure. A nuclear viability study indicated that the inferior myocardium is potentially viable.

The patient's current medications include milrinone, furosemide (Lasix), metolazone, digoxin, spironolactone, low-dose beta-blockers, aspirin, statin, amiodarone, and levothyroxine"

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10-15%, atrial fibrillation, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic kidney disease, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presents with increased dyspnea and is transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for milrinone infusion.

The patient has a history of failure of home therapy with toremide, beta-blocker (BB), and not responding to lasix gtt and metolazone on the floor. She has bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on admission shows worsening mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure. A nuclear viability study indicated that the inferior myocardium is potentially viable.

The patient is currently on the following medications:
- Milrinone at 0.50 mcg/kg/min
- Lasix gtt at 12 mg/hour with metolazone 2.5mg
- Digoxin
- Low dose beta-blocker
- Aspirin
- Statin
- Amiodarone
- Levothyroxine

The patient's vital signs include:
- Temperature: 36.3°C (97.4°F)
- Heart rate: 70 bpm (68-71 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 83/43 mmHg (53/41-105/65 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (15-21 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on nasal cannula (4L)

The patient's laboratory results include:
- White blood cell count: 6.4 K/uL (6.3-11.4 K/uL)
- Hematocrit: 32.7% (31.1-30.3%)
- Platelet count: 165 K/uL (167-164 K/uL)
- Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL (1.3-1.3 mg/dL)
- Glucose: 221 mg/dL (240-126 mg/dL)
- Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 33.4/38.4/3.4, ALT/AST: 27/27, Alk Phos/TBili: 153/1.4, Ca++/Mg++/PO4: 8.1/2.3/2.2 mg/dL

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Right heart failure due to worsening MR.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension and volume overload.
3. Hepatic congestion leading to ascites and potentially hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Respiratory failure due to pulmonary hypertension and bilateral rales.
5. Infection, particularly urinary tract infection (UTI) given the recent use of urinary catheters and the presence of leukocytosis.
6. Bleeding due to supratherapeutic INR caused by Coumadin therapy.
7. Hypothyroidism due to levothyroxine therapy.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and chronic kidney disease.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10-15%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), chronic kidney disease, and a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) on Coumadin. The patient presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for milrinone infusion.

The patient's symptoms and medical history indicate advanced ischemic cardiomyopathy with acute-on-chronic decompressed systolic heart failure. She has failed home therapy with torsemide and beta-blockers (BB). The patient is volume overloaded as evidenced by elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. She is not responding to lasix and metolazone on the floor. The patient has a biventricular (BiV) pacer, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) repeated on admission shows worsening mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure. A nuclear viability study indicated that inferior myocardium is potentially viable.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. The patient has been running negative and started on a heparin drip to bridge until a central venous catheter (cath) could be placed. The patient also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) and was started on oral vancomycin and Flagyl. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and milrinone, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the positive C. Diff result. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/47 to 108/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows stable fluid balance, with a total input of 1,491 mL and total output of 3,800 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed due to limitations in peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and other areas.

The patient presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the CCU for milrinone therapy.

The patient has a history of advanced ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%-15%, which presents with acute-on-chronic decompenstated systolic heart failure. The patient failed home therapy with torsemide and beta-blockers. Physical examination findings include distant heart sounds with an S3 gallop heard best at the left lower sternal border, bounding jugular venous pulsation, bibasilar rales, mild abdominal distension, and cool extremities with 2+ pitting edema to the mid-shins bilaterally.

Laboratory results show elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. The patient has worsening mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), which may be causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure.

The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10%-15%, atrial fibrillation, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic kidney disease, and a history of ICD implantation. She presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for milrinone infusion. The patient has failed home therapy with torsemide, beta-blockers (BB), and presents with acute on chronic decompenstated systolic heart failure. She has elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed worsening mitral regurgitation (MR) which may be causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure. A nuclear viability study indicated that the inferior myocardium is potentially viable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10-15%, atrial fibrillation, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) on Coumadin. The patient presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for milrinone infusion.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and has been on home therapy with torsemide, beta-blockers (BB), and digoxin. However, she has failed to respond to lasix and metolazone on the floor. She also has a bi-ventricular pacemaker.

Her echocardiogram (TTE) showed worsening mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure. A nuclear viability study indicated that the inferior myocardium is potentially viable.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/51 mmHg to 107/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. She is receiving furosemide (Lasix) at 18 mg/hr and heparin sodium at 900 units/hr.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF of 10%-15%, atrial fibrillation, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic kidney disease, and a history of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for milrinone infusion.

The patient has a history of heart failure, as evidenced by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is severely reduced at 10%-15%, indicating advanced heart failure. There is also worsening mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be contributing to pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure. A nuclear viability study indicated that the inferior myocardium is potentially viable.

The patient's coronary arteries are moderately diseased, with a mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) bare-metal stent (BMS). The patient's rhythm is controlled by a ventricular-paced bi-ventricular (BiV) pacemaker due to atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a current infection with Clostridium difficile (C. diff), which was confirmed by positive stool culture in the setting of azithromycin, ciprof"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%-15%, atrial fibrillation, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic kidney disease, and a previous inferior myocardium viability study. She presented with increased dyspnea and was transferred to the CCU for milrinone infusion.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Pump: The patient has advanced ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic heart failure. She failed home therapy with torsemide and beta-blockers (BB). She is volume overloaded as evidenced by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), bilateral rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. She did not respond to lasix and metolazone on the floor. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed worsening mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right heart failure. A nuclear viability study indicated potentially viable inferior myocardium. The plan is to perform left heart catheterization and right heart catheterization when the international normalized ratio (INR) is sufficiently low to assess for possible interventions. This will be discussed further, along with the resolution of the active Clostridium difficile infection.

2. Coronaries: The patient has"
