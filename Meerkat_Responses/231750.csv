   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer, post chemotherapy and radiation, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on prednisone. He presents in respiratory distress and has been on non-invasive ventilation since February 23rd, 1999. The patient also has an indwelling port (Portacath) placed on the same day.

On February 23rd at 7:51 pm, the patient vomited and was given Zofran, morphine, and Ativan. His oxygen saturation (O2 sat) dropped to 90%, and Lasix 20 IV was given, which improved his O2 sat to high 90s. At 4 am, his arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.23, indicating acute respiratory acidosis. Pressure support was increased from 8 to 10, with the same FiO2 of 80% and PEEP of 8. However, at 6 am, the patient's ABG continued to show acute respiratory acidosis, and a decision was made to intubate him. The patient's wife was spoken to over the phone prior to intubation, but when CPAP was removed, the patient's O2 sats decreased abruptly to low 80s. The patient was successfully intubated around 7:30 am.

   #. Respiratory Distress: Patient with labored breathing but no hypoxia
   or hypercarbia on ABG. Diff dx includes worsening CA, PNA, CHF and PE.
   CT does show worsening spread of small cell lung CA and areas of likely
   infiltrate. The patient has a hx CHF with EF 40% and has become volume
   overloaded in the past. It may be that holding his lasix overnight,
   holding BB and given fluids may have caused CHF. He is already being
   treated for PNA. [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] criteria ranges from moderate to high probablity
   (20-60% likelihood) of PE. He is currently too unstable for CTA and as
   he does not have brain mets, I will start a heparin drip for empiric
   anticoagulation with the hope that he will improve tomorrow and be able
   to tolerate a CTA then.

   dose was reduced. In addition, beta blocker was held for concern for
   infection. [**Month (only) **] digoxin and holding the BB may be contributing to
   tachycardia. However, it is likely that pulm HTN, CA, anxiety,
   respiratory distress and underlying infection are driving the sinus
   tachycardia. In addition, in a patient with CA, PE is always possible.
   There has been no hypotension to suggest sepsis.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presents with labored breathing and has a history of small cell lung cancer, which may indicate worsening cancer or pneumonia. The chest X-ray shows complete lung collapse, causing hypoxia and increased respiratory rate. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results show a decreased PaCO2 level, indicating respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation. This could be caused by the lung collapse and the patient's underlying COPD.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a high probability of having a PE based on the [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] criteria. The CT scan shows worsening spread of small cell lung cancer and areas of likely infiltrate. Empiric anticoagulation with heparin has been started.

4. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%, and is on medications for it, including an ICD for primary prevention. The patient is currently in sinus tachycardia, which may be due to pulmonary hypertension, anxiety, underlying infection, or the effect of holding beta-blockers.

5. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tach"

   Also pt
s WBC now 28.5 from 7.1.  Pt

s Well
s score calculated pt to have moderate to high risk of PE and
   was started on heparin. Currently heparin stopped as PNA and
   infiltrates much more likely cause of pt
s respiratory distress. Also
   CHF considered given 2L given in ED, Lasix helped some, but likely [**1-14**]
   and not primary cause. Also COPD may be contributing, but again not
   primary cause.

   # CHF - EF 40% and has become volume overloaded in the past. It may be
   that holding his lasix overnight, holding BB and given fluids may have
   contributed. Pt received Lasix 80 IV x1, and later 20 IV x1 currently
   neg 800ml.
   - hold off on further Lasix for now
   # COPD
   #. Respiratory Distress: Patient with labored breathing but no hypoxia
   or hypercarbia on ABG. Diff dx includes worsening CA, PNA, CHF and PE.
   CT does show worsening spread of small cell lung CA and areas of likely
   infiltrate.. He is already being treated for PNA. [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] criteria ranges
   from moderate to high probablity (20-60% likelihood) of PE. He is
   currently too unstable for CTA and as he does not have brain mets, I
   will start a heparin drip for empiric anticoagulation with the hope
   that he will improve tomorrow and be able to tolerate a CTA then.

   #. Tachycardia: Currently in sinus tachycardia but has Hx afib and VT
   s/p ICD placement. Digoxin level was slightly elevated on admission so
   dose was reduced. In addition, beta blocker was held for concern for
   infection. [**Month (only) **] digoxin and holding the BB may be contributing to
   tachycardia. However, it is likely that pulm HTN, CA, anxiety,
   respiratory distress and underlying infection are driving the sinus
   tachycardia. In addition, in a patient with CA, PE is always possible.
   There has been no hypotension to suggest sepsis.
   - continue digoxin at 0.125mg IV
   - obtain repeat EKG
   - restart BB

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with small cell lung cancer who presents in respiratory distress. The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 45%, s/p ICD placement for primary prevention, and COPD on prednisone. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation and an indwelling port was placed. 

The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, with a drop in oxygen saturation to the low 80s. An ABG showed acute respiratory acidosis, and the decision was made to intubate the patient. After intubation, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 60s, and Levophed was started at 0.1. 

The patient has a new CXR showing complete right lung collapse with widespread parenchymal opacities in the left upper and lower lobes, as well as the lingula. The patient also has an elevated WBC count of 28.5, suggesting an infection. 

The patient is being treated for presumed pneumonia, with broad-spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin. A CT scan from when the patient had a PET scan shows minimal change in the right lung, and the new infiltrates on the left are less likely due to the patient's small cell lung cancer. 

The patient's CHF is also being considered as a possible cause of respiratory distress. The patient received Lasix"

   dose was reduced. In addition, beta blocker was held for concern for
   infection. [**Month (only) **] digoxin and holding the BB may be contributing to
   tachycardia. However, it is likely that pulm HTN, CA, anxiety,
   respiratory distress and underlying infection are driving the sinus
   tachycardia. In addition, in a patient with CA, PE is always possible.
   There has been no hypotension to suggest sepsis.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presents in respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient's newest chest X-ray shows complete right lung collapse, leading to hypoxia and increased respiratory rate. He was intubated, and the endotracheal tube was repositioned.

2. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient's chest X-ray also shows worsening of widespread parenchymal opacities in the left upper lobe, lingula, and left lower lobe. These findings suggest possible pneumonia or lymphangitic spread of small cell lung cancer. The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 7.1 to 28.5, indicating a potential infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension during intubation, which may be due to volume depletion, increased intrathoracic pressure caused by intubation, or medication-related effects.

4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF with reduced ejection fraction. Holding Lasix overnight and giving fluids may have contributed to volume overload.

5. COPD exacerbation: The"

   #. Tachycardia: Currently in sinus tachycardia but has Hx afib and VT
   s/p ICD placement. Digoxin level was slightly elevated on admission so
   dose was reduced. In addition, beta blocker was held for concern for
   infection. [**Month (only) **] digoxin and holding the BB may be contributing to
   tachycardia. However, it is likely that pulm HTN, CA, anxiety,
   respiratory distress and underlying infection are driving the sinus
   tachycardia. In addition, in a patient with CA, PE is always possible.
   There has been no hypotension to suggest sepsis.

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer, post chemotherapy and radiation, CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%, and COPD. He presents in respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypoxia, and hypotension. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 65% and PEEP 8 cmH2O.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, PaO2 of 65 mmHg, and HCO3- of 23 mEq/L. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist, Vt set at 600 mL, RR set at 24, and FiO2 at 65%.

The patient has diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, likely due to pneumonia or lymphangitic spread of SCLC. He also has a right lung collapse. His WBC count has increased from 7.1 to 28.5, indicating an infection or inflammatory response. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with small cell lung cancer who presents in respiratory distress. He has a history of CHF, COPD, and ICD placement for primary prevention. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 65%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of 48, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 65. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening hypoxia and hypercapnia. The chest X-ray (CXR) reveals complete right lung collapse, and the CT scan shows minimal change in the right lung. The patient's WBC count is elevated at 28.5, indicating possible infection. The patient is also showing signs of hypotension, tachycardia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient's ABG results indicate hypercapnia (elevated PaCO2), suggesting inadequate ventilation. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent neurological complications.

2. Pulmonary infiltrates: The CXR shows widespread parenchymal opacities in the left upper and lower lobes, which could be indicative of pneumonia or lymphangitic spread of small cell lung cancer. Further evaluation with sputum cultures and imaging studies is necessary to determine the cause.

3. Acute kidney injury ("

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He presents with respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU. 

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxia and new infiltrate on chest X-ray, which is concerning for pulmonary hemorrhage. He is already intubated with a ventilator set at 600 mL tidal volume, 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 100%. Despite this, his oxygen saturation remains in the upper 80s.

2. Hypotension: The patient initially had hypotension, which occurred during intubation. It could be due to increased intrathoracic pressure or sedatives. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids as needed and may need to restart vasopressor (Levophed) support.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's rising creatinine level indicates acute kidney injury. It is likely pre-renal in origin, possibly due to CHF or volume depletion. Further evaluation is needed, including urine electrolyte analysis and consideration of a renal ultrasound if the results are unrevealing.

4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a baseline ejection fraction of 45"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) presenting with pulmonary hemorrhage and respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on maximal respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and 100% FiO2. The patient's condition has worsened overnight, with oxygen saturation in the 80s and increased blood secretions.

The patient made a decision for do-not-resuscitate (DNR) after a family meeting yesterday. His allergies include no known drug allergies. He has received multiple doses of antibiotics since admission, including vancomycin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), levofloxacin, and cefepime.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypoxemia. His blood pressure is stable but on the lower side. He has a fever of 37.2°C (98.9°F). The patient's respiratory rate is set at 24 breaths per minute with spontaneous respiration being 0. Oxygen saturation is at 83%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. His weight has increased from 75.3 kg at admission to 82.4 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an input of 3,764 mL and output of 967 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,797 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who is experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision after a family meeting. The patient's condition has worsened overnight, with oxygen saturation levels in the 80s on 100% FiO2 and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Blood secretions continue to be present. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is severely compromised, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. This is likely secondary to the pulmonary hemorrhage caused by the tumor.
2. Acute Renal Failure: Although the creatinine levels are stable, the patient's urine output is borderline, indicating a potential risk of acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) values show a gradual decrease, suggesting ongoing bleeding, most likely from the lungs. Further workup or transfusions may be required if the anemia worsens.
4. Potential Infection: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics, suggesting a concern for infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or worsening infection is essential.

Potential Medical Complications to Watch Out for:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged mechanical"
