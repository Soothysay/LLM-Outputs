   Mr. [**Known lastname 67**] is a 69 y.o. man with multiple myeloma complicated by
   multiple vertebral lytic lesions, ESRD on hemodialysis who presents now
   as [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] transfer for worsening hypoxia in setting of new PNA and need
   for high levels of narcotics for pain control.
   .
   #Respiratory distress / hypoxia:  PO2 on room air was 40 early this
   morning and patient reportedly desaturated to high 70s on room air and
   then again to high 70s/low 80s on 3L NC. STAT CXR done and now
   revealing new RUL infiltrative process alongside fevers to the 102
   range. Lactate was WNL and last WBC also WNL. Etiology includes a new
   PNA vs. aspiration event with reactive CXR changes and bronchospasm
   with possible plugging. Patient's PMH notable for immunocompromised
   state and he is at high risk for organisms such as Step PNA given his
   multiple myeloma.
   .
   --continue on NRB for now, will slowly wean as tolerates, does not
   appear to be laboring and in need of intubation at this time
   --repeat STAT ABG
   --will continue broad ABx coverage with Vancomycin, Cefipime & Flagyl
   for better anearobic coverage
   --will taper usual narcotic pain regimen so as not to further
   compromise his respiratory status
   .
   # Severe back pain: He has weakness of both lower extremities at
   baseline but no overt cord compressions or incontinence on recent
   imaging. He had been given IV & PO  morphine for pain control in ED
   with good effects. Now appears in pain with increased motions of his
   lower back region.
   -
   - follow-up palliative care pain consult recommendations
   --continue lidoderm patch, Tylenol and Toradol PRN for now
   --will avoid additional narcotics until his respiratory status and
   transient low BPs (after HD today)improve
   - consider Ortho/Ortho-Onc consult for potential palliative
   interventions for his severe lytic lesions and newer findings on [**8-6**]
   plain lumbar/sacral films
   .
   # Multiple myeloma: As above, he is status post 11 cycles
   velcade/dexamethasone, he got recent first dose Cytoxan on [**2130-7-3**] for
   disease progression on velcade, also treated with Rituxan in past. Dr.
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**] is primary oncologist.
   .
   --continue folate, MVIs, allopurinol, Bactrim ppx.
   -touch base about recent PE and decision to treat/not treat with
   anticoagulation
   --f/up Oncology recommendations from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**]
   .
   # End-stage Renal Disease: Mr. [**Known lastname 67**] has ESRD secondary to his
   multiple myeloma. Last HD session was [**8-5**]. He will continue his usual
   Tuesday session today as he is on a Tues/Thurs/Sat schedule.
   .
   --HD today
   --will continue nephrocaps, iron, folic acid, sevelamer and Epo at HD
   --f/up renal consult recs
   --call IR and IV nurse to discuss HD port/line replacement
   -- renally dose medications
   -- closely monitor electrolyte shifts , replete as needed
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Appears to be near usual baseline currently with his
   cell counts.
   .
   --continue daily monitoring
   --continue iron, epo, multivitamins as above
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Based on risk/benefit of anticoagulation on last
   admit, anticoagulation was stopped but he continues on metoprolol for
   rate control
   .
   -continue monitor on telemetry
   -repeat EKG
   -will continue on metoprolol with holding parameters for low BPs after
   HD
   .
   # Hypertension: Now under control and even having some low BPs status
   post HD this morning.
   .
   -continue ongoing volume control with HD Tues/Thurs/Sat.
   -using solely BB for control for now with hold parameters
   .
   # H/o PE: Diagnosed on recent admission about 2 weeks ago, a small
   subsegmental PE. He was not discharged with anticoagulation. He had
   been on Coumadin long term at home for atrial fibrillation but this was
   discontinued after last admission.
   .
   --will f/up with primary oncologist regarding decision not to
   anticoagulate, will hold off for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and recent pneumonia. He presented to the hospital with worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress. His condition has been complicated by atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and potential complications related to his underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: With the presence of pneumonia and other risk factors, there is a possibility of developing sepsis.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD and ongoing hemodialysis treatments put him at risk for further renal deterioration.
4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension could potentially lead to cardiac arrest.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and underlying conditions increase his risk for developing DVT.
6. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's recent PE diagnosis and discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy raise concerns for another PE episode.
7. Hemolysis: The significant drop in hematocrit levels suggests the possibility of hemolysis, which needs further investigation.
8. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state makes him susceptible to various infections, including those caused by resistant organisms"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has a history of mild dementia, allergies to certain medications, and previous diagnoses of pneumonia, chronic renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for acute pain and chronic pain. His vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 158 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 84/43 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 85% on a nasal cannula. He is receiving multiple IV medications including heparin sodium, haloperidol, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for several medical complications. These may include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient's oxygen saturation is below normal, indicating possible respiratory compromise. This could be due to pneumonia or aspiration, as mentioned in the assessment and plan.

3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently showing signs of hypotension, which can worsen renal function.

4. Delirium: Although not officially diagnosed as delirium, the patient's altered mental status could potentially progress into delirium,"

   patient reportedly desaturated to high 70s on room air and then again
   to high 70s/low 80s on 3L NC. STAT CXR done and now revealing new RUL
   infiltrative process alongside fevers to the 102 range. Lactate was WNL
   and last WBC also WNL. Etiology includes a new PNA vs. aspiration event
   with reactive CXR changes and bronchospasm with possible plugging.
   Patient's PMH notable for immunocompromised state and he is at high
   risk for organisms such as Step PNA given his multiple myeloma.
   .
   --continue on NC for now, will slowly wean as tolerates, does not
   appear to be laboring and in need of intubation at this time
   --will continue broad ABx coverage with Vancomycin, Cefipime & Flagyl

","The patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presents with worsening hypoxia, new pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. He has a history of altered mental status, severe back pain, pancytopenia, and hypertension. The patient is also immunocompromised due to multiple myeloma and is at high risk for organisms such as Step PNA. 

The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia are being managed with continued use of a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery, with plans to slowly wean as tolerated. Broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl is being continued for better anaerobic coverage. Narcotic pain regimen is being tapered to avoid further compromise of respiratory status.

Atrial fibrillation is being managed with metoprolol IV and telemetry monitoring. EKGs are repeated as needed. Pancytopenia is being treated with transfusion of packed red blood cells and daily monitoring. Hemolysis labs are pending.

Severe back pain is being managed with palliative care pain consult recommendations, including the lidoderm patch, Tylenol, and Toradol PRN. Additional narcotics are being avoided until the patient's respiratory status and low BPs improve. Ortho/Ortho-Onc consult is being considered for potential palliative interventions for severe lytic lesions.

He presented to the ICU with worsening hypoxia, respiratory distress, and new pneumonia. He also has atrial fibrillation, pancytopenia, severe back pain, and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C, heart rate of 158 bpm, blood pressure of 84/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, creatinine level, and troponin-T level, while his potassium, sodium, and chloride levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is not fully assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or respiratory status. He is on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, pain control medications, and renal medications.

The patient's assessment includes pneumonia, acute pain, chronic pain, renal failure, altered mental status, and hypotension. The plan involves continuing respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, broad antibiotic coverage, pain management, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old man with multiple myeloma and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presents with worsening hypoxia, pneumonia, acute pain, chronic pain, renal failure, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was receiving metoprolol, which caused a significant drop in blood pressure. He also experienced a 10-point drop in hemoglobin concentration without an obvious source of bleeding. The patient has been given 2 units of packed red blood cells and is currently stable with a blood pressure of 140s/50s.

The patient has severe back pain and weakness in both lower extremities due to multiple myeloma-related vertebral lytic lesions. He requires pain management with opioids. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with a PO2 of 40 on room air and desaturation to the high 70s/low 80s on nasal cannula. A chest X-ray revealed a new right upper lobe infiltrative process alongside fevers. The etiology includes hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAPNA) versus an aspiration event with reactive chest X-ray changes and bronchospasm with possible plugging.

The patient has pancytopenia, with a 10-point drop in hematocrit from 33.0 on [**8-8**] to 23 today. No clear source of bleeding has been identified"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and a history of chronic kidney disease. He presents with worsening hypoxia, new pneumonia, and respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. He has a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration and anemia. The patient is also experiencing severe back pain, weakness in both lower extremities, and atrial fibrillation. He has a history of multiple myeloma treatment and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia are concerning, indicating possible pneumonia or aspiration event. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation, suggests possible bleeding from an unknown source or septic shock. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

3. Anemia: The significant drop in hemoglobin concentration indicates acute blood loss or hemolysis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, and appropriate transfusion support should be provided to maintain oxygen carrying capacity.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requires rate control and rhythm management. Anticoagulation therapy should be considered to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly male with a history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease, and recent aspiration pneumonia. He presents with hypoxia and respiratory distress, for which he has been placed on a nonrebreather mask. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 39, and pO2 of 246. His cardiac enzymes are within normal range, but there are diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating ongoing pulmonary issues.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management drugs, and antihypertensives. He is also on dialysis for his renal failure and has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has resolved after receiving amiodarone. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and tachycardic.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress indicate ongoing respiratory complications. The diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest pneumonia or aspiration, which may require further intervention such as bronchoscopy or tracheostomy.

2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to his recent medication changes, including metoprolol for atrial fibrillation and potential interactions with other medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure and possible adjustment of medications will be necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of low hematocrit (Hct) after receiving 2 units of blood transfusion yesterday. The patient has been experiencing pain and agitation, leading to the administration of fentanyl IV prns and Zyprexa 5 prn x3. Cardiac enzymes show elevated troponin levels. Arterial blood gas (ABG) indicates respiratory acidosis with hypoxia, and chest X-ray reveals pneumonia with diffuse infiltrates. The patient is currently on nonrebreather oxygen and will undergo hemodialysis (HD) this morning.

24-Hour Events:
- Arterial line inserted at 09:00 AM.
- Allergies include Flomax, orthostasis, shellfish derivatives, nausea/vomiting, fish product derivatives, Zolpidem, and possibly worsen Ativan visual hallucinations.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Cefipime at 12:00 PM and Metronidazole at 09:34 PM.
- Infusions include amiodarone at 0.5 mg/min, pantoprazole, haloperidol, morphine sulfate, and lorazepam.
- Other medications include fentanyl started at 06:05 AM.

Review of Systems:
Unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an elderly male with respiratory distress and hypoxia.
- The patient has been in the ICU since admission, receiving various treatments and medications.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes show elevated levels of Troponin-T.
- Arterial line was started, and the patient's blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis.
- The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and chronic pain.
- The patient is unable to move due to restraints.
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension.
- The patient's physical examination reveals decreased lung sounds at the left base.
- The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes.
- The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range.
- The patient's mental status is altered, but not delirium.
- The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and shellfish.
- The patient has been receiving antibiotics, analgesics, antipsychotics, and other medications.
- The patient's condition remains unstable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and oxygen supplementation are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and the administration of antibiotics suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, infection parameters, and organ functions is crucial.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, severe back pain, and end-stage renal disease. He presented with hypoxia and respiratory distress, and his arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 39, pO2 of 246, and HCO3 of 21. He is currently on non-rebreather oxygen and receiving broad antibiotic coverage for pneumonia.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia are concerning. The ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis. The patient's low pO2 levels suggest inadequate oxygenation, which may be due to the pneumonia or aspiration event. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory function is necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows diffuse infiltrates, indicating pneumonia. Given his immunocompromised state and risk factors, he is at high risk for infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the choice of antibiotics should be based on local resistance patterns and culture results.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced a significant drop in blood pressure overnight, possibly due to metoprolol administration for atrial fibrillation control. This could be exacerbated by his chronic renal failure and volume depletion. Close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly Spanish-speaking male with a history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease, and chronic pain. He presented with hypoxia and respiratory distress, and was found to have a pneumonia with diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results showed a pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 39, pO2 of 246, and HCO3 of 21. He is currently on non-rebreather oxygen and has an SpO2 of 100%.

The patient has a history of immunocompromised state, which puts him at high risk for infections such as Staphylococcus pneumoniae (Step PNA). His WBC count is slightly elevated at 7.0. He is being treated with broad antibiotic coverage including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for better anaerobic coverage. Cultures are being followed.

The patient experienced hypotension overnight, with blood pressure dropping from the 130s/80s to the 70s/30s after receiving metoprolol for atrial fibrillation control. He also had a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 33 to 23, but no obvious source of bleeding was identified. He received 3 liters of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells. His Hct is now stable at 25."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic renal failure (CRF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic pain. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia, with a recent diagnosis of pneumonia (likely healthcare-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia). The patient has been agitated and has had episodes of tachycardia. He has received various medications for pain control, including Dilaudid and Haldol, as well as antibiotics for suspected infections. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring fluid resuscitation and transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He has also had episodes of atrial fibrillation, which have been managed with amiodarone. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he is on dialysis. His family is present and involved in discussions about care goals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia suggest an ongoing pulmonary infection. It is important to continue aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including possible aspiration-related pathogens.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may indicate delirium. It is crucial to manage pain effectively, provide appropriate sedation, and ensure adequate communication and family involvement to improve the patient's mental"

   [**8-10**] CRX:
   As compared to the previous examination, the cardiac silhouette is
   unchanged. Also unchanged is the position and course of the right-sided
   double-lumen central venous access line. Finally, mild overhydration is
   present in unchanged manner.
   The pre-existing right upper lobe opacity is minimally less dense but
   also
   minimally more extensive as on the previous radiograph. The opacity now
   occupies virtually all parts of the right upper lobe.
   There is no evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity.
   Relatively
   low lung volumes, unchanged absence of pleural effusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, and recent admission to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications during his stay in the ICU.

1. Agitation and Tachycardia: The patient was found agitated at 4:00 am and given Dilaudid 1 mg and Haldol 5 mg IV. The patient's heart rate was initially in the range of 150s-170s but decreased to 110s once the agitation subsided.

2. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: The patient had a PO2 of 40 on [8-8] and desaturated to high 70s on room air. A STAT chest X-ray revealed a new right upper lobe infiltrative process alongside fevers to the 102 range. The etiology includes HAPNA vs. aspiration event with reactive CXR changes and bronchospasm with possible plugging. The patient is at high risk for organisms such as Step PNA given his immunocompromised state due to multiple myeloma. The patient was desaturating overnight and was put on NRB, now sat 100%. The CRX showed improvement of his PNA and pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, severe back pain, and allergies to shellfish, fish products, and Zolpidem. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hypoxia, with a pre-existing right upper lobe opacity. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly aspiration-related. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's current condition suggests pneumonia, which can be caused by aspiration or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially worsen the patient's overall prognosis.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and chronic renal failure, indicating compromised kidney function. This increases the risk of electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management of fluid and electrolyte balance is essential.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be related to medications, such as metoprolol for atrial fibrillation control, or underlying conditions. Monitoring blood pressure and adjusting medications accordingly will be crucial.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and severe back pain. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hypoxia, with a new right upper lobe infiltrative process. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 145/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of a new right upper lobe infiltrative process suggests a possible pneumonia, which may be aspiration-related given the patient's immunocompromised state.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD secondary to multiple myeloma, and there is a concern about worsening renal function indicated by the drop in hemoglobin from 33 to 23.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension overnight after receiving metoprolol for atrial fibrillation control. This could be due to volume loss or medication side effects.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his heart rate was initially in the range of 150s-160s. He was given amiodarone to control the arrhythmia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, severe back pain, and allergies to certain medications. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia, which was initially thought to be due to aspiration pneumonia (HAPNA) or a pulmonary embolism. However, the patient's condition improved with oxygen therapy and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a rapid heart rate ranging from 150 to 170 beats per minute, with occasional decreases after receiving medication for agitation and pain control. Blood pressure is variable, ranging from 70s/30s to 130s/80s, and has required interventions such as fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions. Oxygen saturation remains stable at around 96%.

The patient has been on several medications, including amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, metoprolol for blood pressure control, pain medications (hydromorphone and fentanyl), antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole), and other medications for chronic conditions like multiple myeloma, ESRD, and chronic renal failure.

Radiology findings indicate the presence of a right upper lobe infiltrative process, which could be consistent with aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Further evaluation and follow-up are planned to assess the resolution of"

   As compared to the previous examination, the cardiac silhouette is
   unchanged. Also unchanged is the position and course of the right-sided
   double-lumen central venous access line. Finally, mild overhydration is
   present in unchanged manner.
   The pre-existing right upper lobe opacity is minimally less dense but
   also
   minimally more extensive as on the previous radiograph. The opacity now
   occupies virtually all parts of the right upper lobe.
   There is no evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity.
   Relatively
   low lung volumes, unchanged absence of pleural effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic renal failure (CRF). He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, hypoxia, pneumonia aspiration, and severe back pain. The patient is immunocompromised due to his multiple myeloma treatment and is at high risk for infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. He received broad antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Flagyl for better anaerobic coverage. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, severe back pain, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state and chronic renal failure. The pneumonia aspiration could lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and CRF, which may worsen during his stay in the ICU. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte shifts is necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension overnight after receiving metoprolol for atrial fibrillation control. Frequent monitoring of blood pressure is required.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), but resolved after amiodarone load. Continuous monitoring on telemetry is necessary, and re-evaluation of amiodarone"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. However, there are several significant events that occurred during the 24-hour period.

The patient's family does not fully understand the patient's condition, and a meeting has been scheduled to discuss care goals. Pain control measures have been implemented, including the administration of HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) and Fentanyl patch. The Vancomycin level was found to be low and was re-dosed according to the hospital's protocol. The patient experienced agitation and was given Dilaudid and Haldol to manage the symptoms. The patient's heart rate was initially high but decreased once the agitation subsided.

The patient has several allergies, including Flomax, shellfish, orthostasis, nausea/vomiting related to fish products, Zolpidem, and visual hallucinations related to Ativan.

The patient received antibiotics on August 10th and 11th, specifically Vancomycin, Cefipime, and Metronidazole. They are also on various ICU medications such as Amiodarone, Pantoprazole, Haloperidol, Hydromorphone, and Metoprolol.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, a heart rate range of 91-173 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 145/52 to"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly male who is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, aspiration, tachycardia, chronic renal failure, and altered mental status. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate in the 100s, blood pressure ranging from 134/30 to 186/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles throughout the lungs, regular and rapid heart rate, and no murmurs or other abnormalities. The patient is unable to move due to restraints. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as low hemoglobin and white blood cell count. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

The patient's plan includes managing tachycardia, pneumonia, pain control, chronic renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments such as antibiotics, analgesics, antipsychotics, and supportive care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis or stress ulcers due to the use of restraints, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, and immunocompromised state. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing tachycardia and hypotension. His blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as leukocytosis. The patient has a new right upper lobe infiltrative process on chest X-ray, suggestive of pneumonia or aspiration event. He is at high risk for infections such as Staphylococcus aureus given his immunocompromised state. The patient's pain appears to be controlled, but he has weakness in both lower extremities. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for better anaerobic coverage. The patient's family does not understand his condition, and there will be a family meeting today to discuss care goals. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's respiratory distress and the presence of a new infiltrative process on chest X-ray, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or further deterioration in oxygenation.
2. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of multiple myeloma."

   multiple vertebral lytic lesions, ESRD on hemodialysis who presents now
   as [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] transfer for worsening hypoxia in setting of new PNA and need
   for high levels of narcotics for pain control.
   # Severe back pain: He has weakness of both lower extremities at
   baseline but no cord compressions or incontinence on recent imaging.
   Pt
s pain appears to be well controled as patient was not aggitated
   overnight.
    -- Currently on HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 2 mg IV Q3H:PRN breakthrough
   pain and Fentanyl patch
   #Respiratory distress / hypoxia:  PO2 on room air was 40 on [**8-8**] and
   patient reportedly desaturated to high 70s on room air and then again
   to high 70s/low 80s on 3L NC. STAT CXR done and now revealing new RUL
   infiltrative process alongside fevers to the 102 range.  Current WBC-
   7.0.  Etiology includes HAPNA vs. aspiration event with reactive CXR
   changes and bronchospasm with possible plugging. Patient's PMH notable
   for immunocompromised state and he is at high risk for organisms such
   as Step PNA given his multiple myeloma.  Pt currently on 5L NC, sats
   96-99%.  CRX shows signs of persistent pulmonary edema, and less dense
   consolidation.
   -- cont Vanco dosed according to HD protocol
   --will continue broad ABx coverage with Vancomycin, Cefipime & Flagyl
   for better anearobic coverage

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical conditions including multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and chronic renal failure. The patient is also immunocompromised.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 101 beats per minute (bpm) with a stable range of 76-138 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/30 mmHg to 186/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a normal range of 7-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient has been on several medications including metoprolol, heparin sodium, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), haloperidol (Haldol), and others. The patient also has allergies to certain medications and shellfish.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles throughout the lungs, regular and rapid heart rate, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The patient is restrained due to agitation and pulling on his lines.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and slightly low potassium levels. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly low, and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are within normal ranges.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo male with history of Multiple Myeloma admit to ICU wtih pneumonia
   and hypoxemia.  This is in the setting of continued requirement for
   significant levels of narcotics with chronic pain and some significant
   issues with respiratory supression.
   1) TACHYCARDIA, OTHER-This was transient and responsive to beta blocker
   intervention.
   -Continue with telemetry
   2) PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   -Flagyl/Vanco/Cefepime
   3) PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN) complicated by Altered
   Mental Status
   -Lidocaine/Fentanyl patches
   -Improved with Zyprexa in mental status
   4) RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)-
   -Continued on dialysis
   -Will move to 2 liters negative today
   5)Multiple Myeloma-No further definative Rx available and are moving to
   supportive care approach at this time.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Patient unable to safely take po intake.  We have seen
   significant risk in regards to [**Last Name (un) 8831**] for nutrtion and supportive care
   through PICC with infection risk.  Would favor enteral feeding via
   tube.  Will need clarification of overall goals of care for patient to
   guide specific medication intervention choices.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and hypoxemia. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Tachycardia: The patient experienced transient tachycardia responsive to beta-blocker intervention. Telemetry should be continued to monitor the heart rhythm.

2. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient is being treated with Flagyl, Vanco, and Cefepime for pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and infection control measures should be maintained.

3. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient has both acute and chronic pain issues complicated by altered mental status. Pain management strategies include Lidocaine/Fentanyl patches and Zyprexa to improve mental status.

4. Renal failure, chronic: The patient has chronic renal failure and is on dialysis. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.

5. Multiple myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, but no further definitive treatment is planned at this time. Supportive care will be provided.

In addition to these specific conditions, the patient's overall care in the ICU includes nutrition support through enteral feeding via a tube, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is DNR/D"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic pain. He presents with worsening hypoxia, new pneumonia, and a need for high levels of narcotics for pain control. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, severe back pain, respiratory distress, hypoxia, hypotension, multiple myeloma, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a new infiltrative process in the right upper lobe, along with fever and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially sepsis.
2. Aspiration: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and difficulty protecting his airway, there is a risk of aspiration leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which can be exacerbated by his current condition and medications. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte shifts is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension. Continuous monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support are required.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm, along with anticoag"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma and end-stage renal disease.
- He was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia in the setting of new pneumonia and the need for high levels of narcotics for pain control.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, severe back pain, respiratory distress/hypoxia, multiple myeloma, and end-stage renal disease.
- He is currently on diltiazem drip for atrial fibrillation control, fentanyl patch for pain control, and hydrophoned (Dilaudid) IV Q3H PRN breakthrough pain.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved with supplemental oxygen and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- He is being monitored closely for any complications related to his conditions, including renal failure and multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a new right upper lobe infiltrative process, which could be indicative of pneumonia. This could lead to worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia.
2. Aspiration: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect his airway increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can complicate the management of his other medical conditions.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to factors such as hypotension, infection, or medication neph"

   69 yo male with multiple myeloma and with persistent decline in the
   setting of persistent pain, renal failure (with anuria) and inability
   to independently maintain nutrition and fluid requirments.  This has
   been complicated by intermittent bouts of agitation and tachycardia.
   1) Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Continue with nodal blockade as needed
   -Will continue with dilt gtt at 10mg/hr and look to wean as possible
   -Long term with better pain control rate control may be easier
   tachycardia is potentially primarily driven by ongoing pain.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma complicated by multiple vertebral lytic lesions, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and worsening hypoxia in the setting of a new pulmonary infection.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 77 bpm (with a range of 68-120 bpm), blood pressure of 135/45 mmHg (with a range of 100-153/27-70 mmHg), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (with a range of 11-20 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, severe back pain and agitation, pneumonia (possibly aspiration), chronic renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient's pain appears to be well controlled with fentanyl patch and hydrocodone (Dilaudid) IV Q3H PRN breakthrough pain.

The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level.

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt  w/ a-fib w/ RVR to the 150s-160s on [**8-9**],
   now resolved after amio load. Was on amio, then transitioned to IV
   lopressor.  Dilt drip was stopped yesterday, transitioned to Metoprolol
   20 mg IV q6h.  HR stable overnight.
   --continue Metropolol IV
   --continue monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Severe back pain/agitation: He has weakness of both lower extremities
   at baseline but no cord compressions or incontinence on recent
   imaging.  Fentanyl patch was increased to 50mcg. Pt
s pain appears to
   be well controled as patient was not aggitated overnight.

   #Respiratory distress / hypoxia:  PO2 on room air was 40 on [**8-8**] and
   patient reportedly desaturated to high 70s on room air and then again
   to high 70s/low 80s on 3L NC. STAT CXR done and now revealing new RUL
   infiltrative process alongside fevers to the 102 range.  Current WBC-
   7.0.  Etiology includes HAPNA vs. aspiration event with reactive CXR
   changes and bronchospasm with possible plugging. Patient's PMH notable
   for immunocompromised state and he is at high risk for organisms such
   as Step PNA given his multiple myeloma.  Pt currently on 4-5L NC, sats
   96-99% and has been afebrile since the day he was transferred to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].
   -- cont Vanco dosed according to HD protocol
   --will continue broad ABx coverage (all started [**8-8**]) with Vancomycin ,
   Cefipime & Flagyl for anearobic coverage, will stop after 8 days total
   --will f/u cultures

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently receiving dialysis. He is also on various medications including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and pain management medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/30 to 135/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's arterial line was removed at 04:00 AM.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated at 82 bpm, which may indicate tachycardia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

2. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient's history of altered mental status increases the risk of aspiration. Pneumonia should be considered as a potential complication, especially if the patient has difficulty clearing secretions or shows signs of infection.

3. Pain control: The patient is experiencing both acute and chronic pain. Proper pain management is crucial to prevent further complications and improve the patient's comfort.

4. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and it is important to monitor his renal function closely. Any deterioration in renal function could lead to additional complications.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and a history of atrial fibrillation, respiratory distress, chronic pain, and immunocompromised state.
- He presents with worsening hypoxia, new pneumonia, and the need for high levels of narcotics for pain control.
- The patient has been transferred to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
- The patient has a history of respiratory distress and hypoxia, which could lead to further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or respiratory failure.
- His recent infection and immunocompromised state increase the risk of developing respiratory complications.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as heart rhythm disturbances, stroke, or heart failure.
- Hypotension and fluid balance management are essential to prevent cardiovascular complications.

3. Renal Failure:
- The patient has chronic renal failure secondary to multiple myeloma, requiring hemodialysis.
- Acute kidney injury or worsening of renal function can occur due to various factors, including infections, medication toxicity, or hypotension.

4. Infection:
- The patient is at high risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state from multiple myeloma and chronic renal failure.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 67**] is a 69 y.o. man with multiple myeloma complicated by
   multiple vertebral lytic lesions, ESRD on hemodialysis who presents now
   as [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] transfer for worsening hypoxia in setting of new PNA and need
   for high levels of narcotics for pain control.

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt  w/ a-fib w/ RVR to the 150s-160s on [**8-9**],
   now resolved after amio load. Was on amio, then transitioned to IV
   lopressor.  Dilt drip was stopped yesterday, transitioned to Metoprolol
   20 mg IV q6h.  HR stable overnight.
   --continue Metropolol IV
   --continue monitor on telemetry
   --will dc a-line today
   .
   # Severe back pain/agitation: He has weakness of both lower extremities
   at baseline but no cord compressions or incontinence on recent
   imaging.  Fentanyl patch was increased to 50mcg. Pt
s pain appears to
   be well controled as patient was not aggitated overnight.
   -- Currently on HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 2 mg IV Q3H:PRN breakthrough
   pain
   -- cont fentanyl patch
   -- Cont zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Respiratory distress / hypoxia:  PO2 on room air was 40 on [**8-8**] and
   patient reportedly desaturated to high 70s on room air and then again
   to high 70s/low 80s on 3L NC. STAT CXR done and now revealing new RUL
   infiltrative process alongside fevers to the 102 range.  Current WBC-
   7.0.  Etiology includes HAPNA vs. aspiration event with reactive CXR
   changes and bronchospasm with possible plugging. Patient's PMH notable
   for immunocompromised state and he is at high risk for organisms such
   as Step PNA given his multiple myeloma.  Pt currently on 4-5L NC, sats
   96-99% and has been afebrile since the day he was transferred to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].
   -- cont Vanco dosed according to HD protocol
   --will continue broad ABx coverage (all started [**8-8**]) with Vancomycin ,
   Cefipime & Flagyl for anearobic coverage, will stop after 8 days total
   --will f/u cultures
   .
   # Multiple myeloma: As above, he is status post 11 cycles
   velcade/dexamethasone, he got recent first dose Cytoxan on [**2130-7-3**] for
   disease progression on velcade, also treated with Rituxan in past. Dr.
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**] is primary oncologist.

   # End-stage Renal Disease: Mr. [**Known lastname 67**] has ESRD secondary to his
   multiple myeloma. Last HD session was [**8-8**]. He will continue his usual
   Tues/Thurs/Sat schedule.
   -- f/u BMT recs regarding Ca level (whether to give bisphosphonate)
   --HD today
   --Epo at HD, PO meds being held as patient cannot protect airway
   --f/up renal consult recs
   -- renally dose medications
   -- closely monitor electrolyte shifts , replete as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and recent hospitalization for worsening hypoxia. He presents with tachycardia, pneumonia, acute and chronic pain, and chronic renal failure. The patient's current medications include fentanyl patch, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), metoprolol, pantoprazole (Protonix), haloperidol (Haldol), heparin sodium, and others. His recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and troponin-T levels. The patient's physical examination reveals normal vital signs, but he has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or bowel movements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has new right upper lobe infiltrative process alongside fevers, suggesting a possible pneumonia. The etiology includes hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAPNA) versus aspiration event. Broad antibiotic coverage is being continued.
2. Respiratory distress/hypoxia: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia, which improved after being transferred to the ICU. He is currently on 4-5L nasal cannula and has stable oxygen saturation levels.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure secondary to multiple myeloma. He requires regular hemodialysis sessions"
