   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F s/p recent b/l breast reduction c/b infection p/w PEA arrest
   s/p multiple cycles of Atropine/Epi likely [**3-1**] PE s/p thrombolytics on
   pressors, intubated, heparin gtt.
   .
   #. Obstructive Cardiogenic Shock: Pt in cardiogenic shock [**3-1**] PE
   burden, CT scan shows RV dilatation and multiple bilateral PEs. TTE
   showed hypokinetic, dilated RV. LV systolic function intact. Pt is
   likely preload dependent and is responding well to continued IVF.
   Dobutamine was given initially, but pt had tachycardia and decreased
   BPs in response. On levo and neo.
   - would favor IVF boluses to maintain BP rather than pressors
   - wean pressors for goal MAPs >65
   - cortisol pending
   .
   #. Large P.E s/p thrombolytics: Pt noted to have a large PE on CT scan
   likely [**3-1**] immobile status s/p surgery. Due to her PEA arrest she
   underwent thrombolytic therapy which ended at 925. Currently on heparin
   gtt. No e/o DIC; fibrinogen likely low [**3-1**] t-PA.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80.
   - monitor coags, Fibrinogen, FDP for e/o DIC
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   - check Hct q4hrs
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   #. s/p PEA arrest: Had 3 episodes, likely [**3-1**] PEs. No e/o cerebral
   ischemic injury although difficult to judge with intubation/sedation.
   - monitor on tele, no events overnight
   .
   #. Tranaminitis: Hepatic congestion [**3-1**] right heart strain vs. ischemic
   hepatitis, degree of elevation more c/w congestion.
   - monitor daily
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6, unknown baseline but presumably normal. Likely
   pre-renal in setting of hypotension/hypoperfusion, but could also have
   ATN from same etiology.
   - monitor response with fluids and improved BP
   - urine lytes pending
   .
   #. HCT drop: Patient had Hct drop despite receiving 2 units PRBC, in
   setting of t-PA and supratherapeutic PTT of >150 on heparin gtt.
   Patient did have visible bleeding from bleed surigical sites, diffuse
   oozing and BRBPR, but there is still concern for occult blood loss with
   this degree of Hct drop. Concern would be for RP bleed.
   - non con CT to r/o RP bleed
   - cont q4h Hct checks and transfuse for goal>30
   .
   #. AMS: Pt noted to be unresponsive initially on examination with no
   sedation on board. At OSH she was reported to have non-focal movement
   of her upper extremities. Now alert, responsive, following commands,
   neuro exam grossly intact. Cannot yet entirely rule out brain injury
   from hypoxia/hypoperfusion, but seems reassuring at this point. Pt c/o
   headache overnight but pupils equal and reactive, headache seems to
   have resolved.
   - will continue to monitor neuro exam q4hrs specfically for pupillary
   reaction
   .
   #. ?Pneumomediastinum: On CXR portable there appears to be trace air in
   the mediastinum, suspect this was artifact and not seen on today
s CXR.
   .
   #. ?Catheter wire: On CXR portable there appears to be an artifact that
   could be a threading wire, unclear if this is external or internal
   though on my check after CXR read there appears to be no external wire.
   Oblique view showed artifact had relocated to below the diaphragm,
   highly unlikely that this is internal. Repeat this AM continues to show
   this foreign object vs. artifact.
   - look at scout images for ab CT
   - consider lateral film
   .
   #. s/p intubation: Pt had good p02 on Fi02 50% and weaned down to 40%
   this AM. Patient has good respiratory drive and mental status would
   likely support extubation.  Will keep intubated today to allow more
   aggressive hydration.
   - PSV trial, maintain patient at most comfortable settings
   .
   #. s/p Breast surgery reduction c/b infection: Will try to obtain OSH
   records regarding pt's recent infectious course. Pt noted to have some
   bleeding at right breast surgical site after tPA.
   - cont levaquin for prior wound infection course
   - D/C vanco since prior wound cx grew GNR
   - f/u bld cx
   - continue with pressure dressing over surgical site

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old female who underwent a recent bilateral breast reduction surgery and subsequently developed an infection. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and received multiple cycles of atropine and epinephrine. She also received thrombolytic therapy for a large pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently on heparin. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 40%. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 18 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.8 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and elevated creatinine levels at 1.6 mg/dL. Her coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) of 150.0 seconds, but normal international normalized ratio (INR). Her blood glucose level is elevated at 176 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include obstructive cardiogenic shock due to a significant burden of pulmonary embolism, large PE s/p thrombolytics,"

","The patient is a 51-year-old female who underwent a bilateral breast reduction surgery and subsequently developed an infection, leading to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, she was found to have multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), resulting in obstructive cardiogenic shock. She received thrombolytic therapy but experienced bleeding at the surgical site. The patient's current condition is stable, with good hemodynamic response to fluid resuscitation. She is on pressors and inotropic support. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Obstructive Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely preload dependent and responding well to continued intravenous fluids (IVF). It is important to continue IVF boluses and wean pressors for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. If a second pressor is needed, an inotrope like dopamine or dobutamine may be added.

2. Large PE s/p Thrombolytics: The patient had a large PE and underwent thrombolytic therapy. She is currently on heparin gtt with a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-80. It is important to monitor coagulation parameters, fibrinogen, and fibrin degradation products (FDP) for evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A unit of packed red blood"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Obstructive Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock due to a significant burden of pulmonary embolisms (PEs), as indicated by the CT scan showing right ventricular (RV) dilatation and multiple bilateral PEs. The patient's hypokinetic, dilated RV and intact left ventricular (LV) systolic function suggest that they are likely preload dependent and responding well to continued intravenous fluids (IVF).

2. Large PE post thrombolytics: The patient has a large PE, likely resulting from immobility status post surgery. Due to their previous PEA arrest, they underwent thrombolytic therapy, which ended at 9:25 AM. Currently, they are on heparin gtt. No evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); fibrinogen likely low.

3. s/p PEA arrest: The patient had three episodes of PEA arrest, likely caused by the PEs. They exhibit end-organ ischemia and hypoperfusion, as indicated by elevated creatinine (Cr) and liver function tests (LFTs). There is no evidence of cerebral ischemic injury, although it is difficult to assess with intubation and sedation.

4. AMS (Altered Mental Status): Initially, the patient was unresponsive with no sedation. They were reported"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo female s/p breast reduction now presenting with massive PE and
   PEA arrest.  She now has had some meaningful improvement in neurologic
   status and able to respond to verbal stimuli and is compaining of
   headache overnight.  Importantly she has had rapid wean of FIO2
   overnight with preserved oxygenation.  Urine output has been maintained
   at 30-40cc/hr.
   1)Cardiac Arrest-Patient with PEA arrest secondary to pulmonary
   embolism now s/p thrombolysis
   -Will follow exam
   -Will support for persistent cardiogenic shock
   2)Respiratory Failure-This is secondary to arrest with need for
   intubation and now patient currently with left sided effusion and
   likely consolidation.  Patient with good respiratory effort this
   morning favorable compliance and will move to support in pressure
   support ventilation mode.
   -PSV today and will continue to follow via ABG
   -Do see substantial improvement in mental status and oxygenation
   -Will maintain patient intubated while we are continuing to support
   through cardiogenic shock
   Vanco/Levo
   3)Shock-Cardiogenic
   -Levophed and neosynephrine
   -Will provide fluid bolus for recurrent hypotension
   -Elevation in LFT
s is likely secondary to shock liver and continued
   congestion.
   4)Pulmonary Embolism-
   -PTT has been elevated and have Heparin held
   -Goal PTT is 60-80
   5)Altered Mental Status-
   -Versed Fentanyl
   -Patient with good response to verbal commands and able to follow
   commands
   6)Acute Renal Failure-Continued rise in creatinine to 2.1
   -Urine lytes this morning
   -Will need to evlauate urine sediment
   -Will have to consider dye load as possible contribution

","Summary:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female who presented with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
- The patient has shown some improvement in neurologic status, responding to verbal stimuli and maintaining urine output.
- The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, with a plan to wean FiO2 and transition to pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- The patient has a left-sided pleural effusion and likely consolidation.
- The patient's cardiac arrest was secondary to the pulmonary embolism and she received thrombolysis.
- She is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is being supported with vasopressors (Levophed and neosynephrine).
- The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock liver and continued congestion.
- The patient has an elevated PTT, and heparin was held. The goal PTT is 60-80.
- The patient's altered mental status is being managed with midazolam and fentanyl.
- The patient has acute renal failure, with a rising creatinine level of 2.1.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female who underwent a recent bilateral breast reduction surgery and is now experiencing complications. She has been in cardiogenic shock, had a pulmonary embolism (PE) with subsequent thrombolytic therapy, anemia, transaminitis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), altered mental status (AMS), and potential catheter wire issue. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Obstructive Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock due to a large PE burden, and her right ventricular (RV) function is compromised while left ventricular (LV) systolic function remains intact. She responds well to intravenous fluids (IVF) but continues to require pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.
2. Large PE post thrombolytics: The patient had a large PE on CT scan likely related to her immobile status after surgery. She underwent thrombolytic therapy and is currently on heparin drip. Fibrinogen levels may be low.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is decreasing despite transfusions, indicating ongoing blood loss. The source of bleeding is unclear, and it cannot be entirely explained by surgical site bleeding. Hemolysis labs should be ordered.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female who has experienced a recent bilateral breast reduction surgery with postoperative infection. She was subsequently diagnosed with a large pulmonary embolism (PE) and underwent thrombolytic therapy. The patient also had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was resuscitated.

The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. She is receiving multiple infusions, including norepinephrine, heparin, midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. The patient's urine output is low, and she has an elevated fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 0.6%, indicating renal dysfunction. The CT scan shows persistent nephrograms bilaterally, consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Additionally, there is colonic distention and focal wall thickening of the transverse colon, which could be due to an infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic cause.

The patient's blood pressure is slightly hypotensive, ranging in the 80s, but responds well to fluids. She becomes hypotensive when pain medications are increased. The patient received one unit of blood overnight, but the destination of the blood is unknown.

Other findings from the patient's lab results include anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 157 K/uL,"

   51 yo female with cardiac arrest and now with remarkable improvement in
   mental status and oxygenation 2 days following event.  She now has had
   persistent hypotension which has required pressor support but has moved
   to increased urine flow and negative fluid balance in past 24 hours.
   This morning she has had good tolerance of minimal pressure suppport
   settings and with favorable RSBI and good tolerance of SBT for 45
   minutes at the time of patient examination.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Patient with movement to SBT and great tolerance
   of 5/0 through this morning.  Patient respond appropriately to voice
   commands and able to lift head off of bed.   We will follow up on ABG
   at termination of SBT and favorable numbers would point to best
   opportunity for success.
   -Extubation this morning
   -Follow up eval of cuff leak
   -Will need pain control post extubation for likely significant rib
   fractures and previous pain with infection

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female who experienced cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. She has shown improvement in mental status and oxygenation over the past two days. However, she continues to have persistent hypotension requiring pressor support. There has been an increase in urine flow and a negative fluid balance in the past 24 hours. The patient tolerated minimal pressure support settings well and passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for 45 minutes. She is able to respond to voice commands and lift her head off the bed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern as she initially experienced respiratory failure following her cardiac arrest. Although she tolerated the SBT well, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if extubation is not successful or if she develops any complications post-extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires ongoing pressor support. If the hypotension does not improve or if the pressor medications cause any adverse effects, it could lead to further complications.
3. Infection: The patient's history of infection and the presence of abdominal pain suggest a potential ongoing or recurrent infection. If the infection worsens or spreads, it could lead to sepsis and additional complications.
4. Kidney Dysfunction: The note mentions concerns about acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and potential kidney dysfunction. If kidney function does not improve, it may result"

   # Anemia: Pt continues to have falling Hct despite transfusions. Source
   of bleeding unclear- unlikely to be all explained by surgical site, CT
   ab neg for RP bleed.   No signs of hemolysis.  Patient does have
   ecchymosis in left groin (line placed in rt groin).
   - cont q4 Hct checks and transfuse for Hct<25
   - CT legs to determine if thigh bleed
   - consider rescan of abdomen if Hct continues to fall
   #. Obstructive Cardiogenic Shock: Pt in cardiogenic shock [**3-1**] PE
   burden. TTE showed hypokinetic, dilated RV. LV systolic function
   intact. Pt is likely preload dependent and is responds well to IVF.
   Now weaned off of pressors, with BP low overnight secondary to pain
   medication but up this morning.
   - will continue fluid boluses versus PRBCs prn for hypotension
   - if BP remains stable, would like to diurese today (pt currently
   autodiuresing, but will monitor UOP for goal 2L neg)
   .
   #. Large PE s/p thrombolytics: Pt noted to have a large PE on CT scan
   likely [**3-1**] immobile status s/p surgery. Due to her PEA arrest she
   underwent thrombolytic therapy on [**1-24**]. Currently on heparin gtt. No
   e/o DIC; fibrinogen likely low [**3-1**] t-PA.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80.
   - transfuse for goal Hct>30
   - check Hct q4hrs
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]: FeNA 0.6. Cr continues to increase after hydration and improved
   hemodynamics, more consistent with ATN caused by
   hypoperfusion/hypotension. CT scan also showed e/o ATN bilaterally.
   - renally dose meds
   - trend Cr and lytes daily
   - consider renal consult if Cr worsens
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Hepatic congestion [**3-1**] right heart strain vs.
   ischemic hepatitis, degree of elevation more c/w congestion.  Trending
   down today.
   - continue to monitor
   ..
   #. AMS: alert, responsive, following commands, neuro exam grossly
   intact. Cannot yet entirely rule out brain injury from
   hypoxia/hypoperfusion, but seems reassuring at this point
   - will continue to monitor neuro exam q4hrs specfically for pupillary
   reaction
   .
   #. ?Catheter wire: On CXR portable there appears to be an artifact that
   could be a threading wire, unclear if this is external or internal
   though on my check after CXR read there appears to be no external wire.
   Oblique view showed artifact had relocated to below the diaphragm,
   highly unlikely that this is internal.
   - Repeat films have shown no foreign object
   .
   #. s/p Breast surgery reduction c/b infection: Pt noted to have some
   bleeding at right breast surgical site after tPA. Plastics following.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female who underwent a bilateral breast reduction surgery and developed an infection post-surgery.
- She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest three times and received atropine and epinephrine.
- The patient was found to have multiple large pulmonary emboli (PEs) and underwent thrombolytic therapy.
- She required intubation, pressors, and invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated in the morning.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been falling despite transfusions, with no clear source of bleeding identified.
- She has ecchymosis in the left groin, where a central line was placed.
- The patient is in cardiogenic shock with evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on echocardiogram.
- She is preload dependent and responding well to intravenous fluids.
- The patient's blood pressure is low overnight but stable in the morning.
- She is on heparin drip for a large PE and has a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-80.
- The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is increasing, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion/hypotension.
- A CT scan showed evidence of ATN bilaterally.
- The patient has transaminitis, likely due to hepatic congestion from right heart strain or ischemic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old female who underwent recent bilateral breast reduction surgery and developed an infection. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest three times and received thrombolytic therapy. The patient is currently on heparin infusion, off pressors, and extubated. She has been experiencing falling hematocrit (Hct) levels despite transfusions, with no clear source of bleeding. The patient has ecchymosis in her left groin, where a line was placed in her right groin. The Hct checks will be continued, and the patient will be transfused if the Hct falls below 25. A CT scan of the legs will be done to determine if there is a thigh bleed, and a rescan of the abdomen will be considered if the Hct continues to fall.

The patient has respiratory failure with poor inspiratory effort and fluid overload. She has been taken out of bed to a chair and will undergo physical therapy. Nebulizers with albuterol and atrovent will be used, along with diuretics.

The patient's mental status is altered, and she is perseverative with short-term memory deficits from hypoxia/hypoperfusion. Her long-term functional status is unclear. Neurological examination will continue to be monitored, and sedation medications will be minimized.

The patient is in cardiogenic shock due to a pulmonary embolism (PE) burden. A transthor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female who underwent recent bilateral breast reduction surgery and is now experiencing complications. She had a postoperative infection and was found to have pulmonary embolism (PE), for which she received thrombolytic therapy. The patient also experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest three times and was resuscitated with atropine and epinephrine. She has been intubated and is receiving invasive ventilation, but was successfully extubated in the morning. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been falling despite transfusions, indicating ongoing bleeding. The source of bleeding is unclear, and there are no signs of hemolysis. The patient has ecchymosis in her left groin, where a line was placed. She is currently on heparin drip, and her blood pressure is low due to pain medication. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion with moderately severe interstitial edema. Her laboratory results indicate anemia, obstructive cardiogenic shock, a large PE, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), transaminitis, and possible catheter wire artifact. The patient's neuro exam is intact, but she may have experienced brain injury from hypoxia/hypoperfusion. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 155/"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is the invasive ventilation stoppage. The patient was successfully extubated in the morning and did well post-extubation. However, the patient experienced nonbloody, bilious emesis at 2 am after receiving PO dilaudid. The patient was given Zofran and Compazine, and no further episodes of emesis occurred.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, Macrobid (Oral), and Betadine (Topical). The last dose of antibiotics was levofloxacin on 1/24 at 6:00 PM, and vancomycin on 1/25 at 7:43 AM.

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 1,000 units/hour. Other ICU medications include fentanyl, which was administered on 1/26 at 12:33 PM, and heparin sodium, which was given on 1/26 at 12:39 PM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) at 10 pm, with a current temperature of 37.2°C (99°F). The heart rate is 94 bpm with a range of 91-118 bpm. Blood pressure is 155/57 mmHg with a previous low of 83/40 mmHg. Respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo female admitted with pulmonary embolus and PEA arrest now with
   extubation completed but with residual issues of renal failure, anemia,
   pain and persistent memory deficits.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This is currently greatest risk to patient with
   immobility and this was emphasized with her and staff would agree.
   -Will continue incentive spirometry 10x/hr while awake
   -Will need to get out of bed today
will get PT consult to aid in
   mobilization
   -Will need nebs to continue to support
   2)Anemia-Concerning for blood loss as we have no evidence of hemolysis
   and no bowel movements.
   -CT of thigh/groin area
   -Continue to transfuse as needed based on 8 hour intervals
   -Goal HCT=>24 with evidence of acute loss
   3)Renal Failure-Likely ATN and pre-renal insult with myocardial
   dysfunction and arrest.  Does appear to be in the phase of post ATN
   diruesis and will have to follow function and fluid balance
   -Follow urine output
   -Goal negative 2-4 liters today
   4)Altered Memory-This is quite likely attributable to transient anoxic
   insult with arrest as residual effects of medications have likely
   passed.
   -Will have to consider behavior
   5)Pain Control-
   -Will use as needed Dilaudid
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will move to PO as tolerated with return of bowel function

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female admitted with pulmonary embolus and PEA arrest. The patient has completed extubation but is still experiencing issues with renal failure, anemia, pain, and persistent memory deficits. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's immobility increases the risk of respiratory failure. To prevent this, incentive spirometry should be continued 10 times per hour while awake. The patient needs to be mobilized, and a physical therapy consult should be obtained to aid in mobilization. Nebulizers will also continue to support respiratory function.

2. Anemia: The patient has persistent anemia, which may be due to blood loss as there is no evidence of hemolysis or bowel movements. A CT scan of the thigh/groin area should be performed to investigate further. Blood transfusions should be continued based on 8-hour intervals. The goal hematocrit (HCT) should be greater than 24 with evidence of acute loss.

3. Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with a pre-renal insult caused by myocardial dysfunction and arrest. It appears that the patient is in the phase of post-ATN diuresis, and urine output should be closely followed. The goal is negative fluid balance of 2-4 liters today.

4. Altered Memory: This is likely attributed to"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female who underwent recent bilateral breast reduction surgery and experienced an infection. She presented with poor inspiratory effort and fluid overload, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient also had an embolism in the pulmonary artery (PE), leading to obstructive cardiogenic shock. She underwent thrombolytic therapy and is currently on heparin. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels continue to fall despite transfusions, with no clear source of bleeding identified. There is a possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion/hypotension. The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels are increasing, indicating renal impairment. Additionally, she has transaminitis, which may be caused by hepatic congestion or ischemic hepatitis. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, pantoprazole, and Lasix. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/64 to 180/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bleeding: Despite the patient receiving multiple transfusions, her Hct levels continue to fall. This could indicate ongoing internal bleeding or ineffective transfusion management.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN):"

","The patient is a 51-year-old female who underwent recent bilateral breast reduction surgery and subsequently developed an infection. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest three times, likely due to a large pulmonary embolism (PE), and received thrombolytic therapy. The patient is now on heparin infusion and has been extubated.

The patient's current medical issues include anemia, respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with right ventricular strain, acute kidney injury (AKI), transaminitis, and a surgical site infection at the breast reduction site.

The plan includes monitoring the patient's hemoglobin levels and transfusing if the hemoglobin is below 25. The source of bleeding is unclear, as the CT scan of the thigh showed no evidence of bleeding. The patient has ecchymosis in the left groin, where a line was placed. HCT checks will be done every six hours, and if the patient is stable, the checks can be spaced out.

For respiratory failure, the patient is being given incentive spirometry, chest physical therapy, albuterol/atrovent nebs, diuresis, and will be weaned off the ventilator. The patient's neurological status is being monitored, and sedation medications are being minimized.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof s/p PEA arrest (in field) attritubed to bilateral pulmonary
   emboli.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- resolved.  Attributed to acute pulmonary emboli
   and PEA arrest.  Monitor RR, SaO2.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI -- s/p arrest and thrombolysis.  Predisposing
   condition of immobility following surgery.  Continue anticoagulation.
   Maintain PTT
   ANEMIA -- attributed to acute blood loss.  No recent transfusion, but
   now may be re-equilibrating.  At risk for blood loss into thigh (sight
   of femoral central line).  Monitor serial Hct, maintain Hct >24.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN in context of PEA arrest.
   NAUSEA -- attributed to narcotics (in part), and other medications.
   CHEST PAIN -- attributed to chest compressions (CPR).
   BACK PAIN -- upper, chronic.  Continue medications.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded from resussitation.  Goal net negative
   2 L over next 24 hrs.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of pulmonary emboli, which resulted in a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient underwent thrombolysis and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. 

The patient's complaints include generalized skin/body ""soreness,"" chest pain in the area of chest compressions, and upper back pain. The patient denies dyspnea. 

The review of systems is largely unremarkable except for the aforementioned complaints. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 175/65 mmHg to 183/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal pupils, and clear breath sounds bilaterally. The patient is alert and oriented, with no focal neurological deficits. 

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 174 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 115 mg/dL. Renal function tests indicate acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include monitoring the respiratory status, continuing antico"

   Pt. known to MICU service (transferred out yesterday following
   treatment for PEA arrest attributed to massive bilateral pulmonary
   emboli --> lysis).  Returns now for management of worsening anemia.
   Early this AM, noted to have significant amount of blood and clots in
   bedsheets.  Repeat Hct= 20.8, PTT= 81 (on heparin).  No hemodynamic
   compromise or symptoms.  Heparin held.  Transfused 2 units PRBC and
   transferred to MICU for further evaluation and management.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof s/p PEA arrest (in field) attritubed to bilateral pulmonary
   emboli (lysis), now with acute GI/GU bleed.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to acute blood loss.  Concerns include GI or GU
   blood loss.  At risk for blood loss into thigh (sight of femoral
   central line) or retropritoneal bleed.  Concern for ishemic bowel
   (noted inflammation on most recent CT scan).  No evidence for
   hemolysis.  Echymosis (chest, arms, right groin) accounts for some
   blood loss.  Plan check NGT lavage to assess for UGI bleeding source.
   Monitor serial abd exam, serial Hct, maintain Hct >24.  GI and GU
   consultation.  Repeat ABD/pelvic CT scan.  General surgery to F/U.
   Hold anticoagulation pending evaluation.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI -- s/p arrest and thrombolysis.  Predisposing
   condition of immobility following surgery.  Hold anticoagulation,
   resume once bleeding issue resolved.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN in context of PEA arrest.  Slow
   recovery, but may be left with chronic insufficiency.
   NAUSEA -- attributed to narcotics (in part), and other medications.
   Monitor symptoms and abdominal exam.  Provide symptomatic relief.
   CHEST PAIN -- attributed to chest compressions (CPR).  Symptomatic
   relief.
   BACK PAIN -- upper, chronic.  Continue medications to optimize pain
   management.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded from resussitation.  Goal net negative
   2 L over next 24 hrs.
   BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY -- complicated by incision infections -->
   monitored by Plastic Surgery.  Dressing changes.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO, but poor intake.
   ACTIVITY -- encourage OOB to chair (with assist).

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 51F s/p recent PEA arrest from massive PE now
   presenting to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] in ther setting of falling HCTs and BRBPR in the
   setting of a Heparin gtt.
   .
   #: HCT Drop: Pt remains hemodynamically stable with SBPs in 160s. This
   AM she had two more bloody bowel movements, and despite transfusions
   she appearrs to have stagnated at a hct of 27.  At this point her blood
   loss appearrs to be a combination of GI and breast.
   - Maintain access via Power PICC, attempt to gain 1 18g PIV
   - q4Hct Checks
 in agreement with GI and surgery our stated goal is 30
   in case she opens up
   - GI Consult
 refusing to scope, suggested tagged red cell scan which
   was negative.
   - CT Torso  - showed right breast hematoma, some ileal/jejunal
   thickening
   - Consider repeat tagged red cell scan with increased bleeding to
   identify source, attending-to-attending with GI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old female who presented to the hospital with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE), resulting in a cardiac arrest from which she was resuscitated. She has since been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has experienced several complications including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a breast hematoma, and acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient's vital signs are generally stable, with a blood pressure in the 150s, heart rate in the 90s, respiratory rate in the 20s, and oxygen saturation at 96%. She has been on therapeutic heparin infusion since admission and remains hemodynamically stable.

The patient's laboratory results show a drop in hemoglobin (HCT) levels, indicating ongoing blood loss. Despite transfusions, her HCT has stagnated at around 27%. Her white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels are within normal range.

The patient's management plan includes maintaining access for blood transfusions, monitoring her HCT levels closely, and attempting to identify the source of the bleeding. A tagged red cell scan was performed but showed no identifiable source. Surgical consultation has been requested for possible endoscopy or other interventions. An IVC filter is also being considered to prevent further pulmonary embolisms.

The patient's recent blood glucose levels have been within normal range, and her urine output has been good, suggesting no immediate concerns regarding her glycemic control or"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female who presented to the ICU with a recent pulmonary embolism (PE) arrest and is now experiencing multiple medical complications. 

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure remains in the 160s despite being hemodynamically stable.
2. Falling hematocrit (HCT) levels: The patient's HCT has been dropping despite transfusions, indicating ongoing blood loss from both gastrointestinal (GI) and breast sources.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had several bloody bowel movements, and a tagged red cell scan did not identify the source of bleeding. The GI consult recommended a repeat tagged red cell scan with increased bleeding to identify the source. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will have a bowel regimen started.
4. Breast hematoma: The patient developed a hematoma in the right breast following bilateral breast reduction surgery. The hematoma was drained, and the wound is packed with surgicel and wrapped with a compressive dressing.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.6 on admission to 2.4 yesterday, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. This may be due to hypotensive events and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and antihypertensive medications have been held due to the"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 51F s/p recent PEA arrest from massive PE now
   presenting to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] in ther setting of falling HCTs and BRBPR in the
   setting of a Heparin gtt.
   .
   #: HCT Drop: Pt remains hemodynamically stable with SBPs in 160s. This
   AM she had two more bloody bowel movements, and despite transfusions
   she appearrs to have stagnated at a hct of 27.  At this point her blood
   loss appearrs to be a combination of GI and breast.
   - Maintain access via Power PICC, attempt to gain 1 18g PIV
   - q4Hct Checks
 in agreement with GI and surgery our stated goal is 30
   in case she opens up
   - GI Consult
 refusing to scope, suggested tagged red cell scan which
   was negative.
   - CT Torso  - showed right breast hematoma, some ileal/jejunal
   thickening
   - Consider repeat tagged red cell scan with increased bleeding to
   identify source, attending-to-attending with GI
   - IV PPi
   - Type and Cross 4 units at all time pRBCs
   - discuss IVC filter with IR
   - continue heparin for now, if hemodynamically unstable reverse with
   protamine.
   .
   #: PE: PT remains hemodynmically stable. Has been on therapeutic
   Heparin gtt since admission. Would like to get IVC filter today.
   - continuing heparin for now
   - IVC filter
     .
   #: [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 2.0 today from 2.4 yesterday, unclear baseline but was 1.6
   on admission which peaked at 3.0. Pt continues to make good UOP. Likely
   ATN following hypotensive event.
   - Cont to trend
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   #: Hypertension: Pt on Lisinopril 20mg as outpatient. Have held
   antihypertensives while in house given given Hct drop and PE. Continue
   to trend.
   - Restart ACEi at lower dose once Hct stabilizes and renal function
   improves
   - Will tolerate higher blood pressures in the setting of her GI bleed
   .
   #  AMS: Pt remains AOx3 with neuro some likely with short term memory
   deficits from hypoxia/hypoperfusion, sedation.   Concern for some ICU
   delerium at night
   - Continue to monitor and trend
   - will continue to monitor neuro exam
   - minimize sedation medications; will space out dilaudid prn
   - haldol PRN for agitation
   .
   #: Bilateral Breast Reduction Sugery: Being following by plastics. Per

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof s/p PEA arrest (in field) attritubed to bilateral pulmonary
   emboli (lysis), now with acute GI bleed.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to acute blood loss.  Appears to be GI (lower
   source).  Blood loss also through breast incision sites, and at risk
   for blood loss into thigh (sight of femoral central line).  Concern for
   ishemic bowel (noted inflammation on most recent CT scan).  No evidence
   for hemolysis.  Ecchymosis (chest, arms, right groin) accounts for some
   blood loss.  Monitor serial abd exam, serial Hct, maintain Hct >28.  GI
   consultation in place.  General surgery to F/U.  Hold anticoagulation
   pending evaluation.
   GI bleed
 unclear source, but concerns include diverticular bleed,
   ischemic colitis, or tumor.  Not yet identifed site.  If persistent
   bleeding (off heparin) would proceed with repeat bleeding scan, and
   consider angiography +/- embolizattion.  GI service and Surgery
   following.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI -- s/p arrest and thrombolysis.  Predisposing
   condition of immobility following surgery.  WouldHold anticoagulation,
   resume once bleeding issue resolved.  If unable to continue
   anticoagulation, would place IVC filter (removable).
   NAUSEA
 evidence for ileus (gastric and proximal small bowel air-fluid
   level).  Unfortunately pt. self d/c
d OGT.  Will encourage pt to accept
   replacement of NGT.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to ATN in context of PEA arrest.  Slow
   recovery, but may be left with chronic insufficiency.
   NAUSEA -- attributed to narcotics (in part), and other medications.
   Monitor symptoms and abdominal exam.  Provide symptomatic relief.
   CHEST PAIN -- attributed to chest compressions (CPR).  Symptomatic
   relief.
   BACK PAIN -- upper, chronic.  Continue medications to optimize pain
   management.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded from resussitation.  Goal net negative
   2 L over next 24 hrs.
   BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY -- complicated by incision infections, now
   with bleeding complications while on heparin --> monitored by Plastic
   Surgery.  Dressing changes.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 concern for arrest-associated encephalopathy.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO, but poor intake.
   ACTIVITY -- encourage OOB to chair (with assist).

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old individual who experienced a previous pulmonary embolism and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The source of the bleeding is unclear, but potential causes include diverticular bleed, ischemic colitis, or tumor. The patient's Hct (hematocrit) level is being monitored to maintain it above 28. 

The patient also has a history of breast reduction surgery that was complicated by incision infections and bleeding while on heparin. The wound is being monitored by the Plastic Surgery team, and dressing changes are performed as needed.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be attributed to arrest-associated encephalopathy. The patient's nausea is managed symptomatically, and there is concern for ileus based on abdominal imaging. 

The patient's renal function is compromised due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following the PEA arrest. There is a plan to encourage the patient to accept replacement of the nasogastric tube (NGT). 

Fluid management is important as the patient is volume overloaded from resuscitation efforts. The goal is to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 2 liters over the next 24 hours. 

Overall, the patient's conditions include anemia due to acute blood loss, GI bleed with unclear source, pulmonary embolism, nausea"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to a pulmonary embolism and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient underwent thrombolysis and survived but developed acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of the bleeding is unclear, but potential causes include diverticular bleeding, ischemic colitis, or a tumor. The patient has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells over the past 24 hours. He also has bleeding from his right breast surgical incision site. 

The patient's mental status is described as some perseveration and confusion, which is not his usual baseline. He has a history of allergies to penicillins, Macrobid (nitrofurantoin/nitrofuran mac), and Betadine (topical). He is currently on heparin, pantoprazole (Protonix), and haloperidol (Haldol). 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 161/65 mmHg to 180/77 mmHg, heart rate between 98-109 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female who presented to the hospital with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequent cardiopulmonary arrest. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable hemodynamically with a blood pressure in the 160s. The patient has experienced a drop in hematocrit (HCT) levels and bloody bowel movements, indicating ongoing blood loss. A repeat red blood cell (RBC) tagged scan revealed a sigmoid bleed. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed, and the patient's heparin drip has been stopped.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, for which she was taking lisinopril 20mg as an outpatient. Her antihypertensive medications have been held due to the recent HCT drop and PE. The patient's renal function is improving, with a creatinine level decreasing from 2.0 to 1.7 today.

The patient's neurological status is as follows: she remains alert and oriented to time, place, and person (AOX3), but exhibits some short-term memory deficits likely due to hypoxia/hypoperfusion. There is a concern for possible ICU delirium, particularly at night. Neurological monitoring and trending will continue, with the aim of minimizing sedation medications and closely observing for any changes in neurologic exam.

Surgical consultations have been obtained, including a bilateral breast reduction surgery, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female who presented to the hospital with a chief complaint of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). She has a history of recent pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct) levels and has had recurrent bloody bowel movements. A repeat tagged red blood cell scan confirmed a sigmoid bleed. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and the patient is no longer receiving heparin. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 154/57 mmHg to 190/68 mmHg. Her heart rate has been consistently around 86 beats per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is elevated at 30 breaths per minute, possibly due to sedation. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's neurological assessment shows some short-term memory deficits, likely due to hypoxia and hypoperfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient continues to experience recurrent bloody bowel movements, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to control the bleeding and stabilize the patient's Hct levels.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with some readings indicating hypotension. This may be due to the ongoing blood loss and the patient"

","Summary:
The patient presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and was found to have a sigmoid bleed. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and heparin was stopped. The patient is scheduled for a left external iliac artery embolization (LENIs) procedure in the morning. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to Macrobid (Nitrofurantoin) and Betadine (Povidone-Iodine), which caused redness and itching. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recurrent bloody stool overnight. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 154/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination findings include trace lower extremity edema, warm skin, and normal neurologic status.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 173 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.1%, platelet count of 174 K/uL, creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL, glucose of 115 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values indicate possible liver dysfunction and elevated lactate levels.

   Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
   - put in OT consult
   - LENIs (-), wet read
   - GI -> suggested restarting anti-coag, only if pt started prep for
   possible colonoscopy if sigmoid hemorrhage recurred.  pt declined prep,
   so will cont to defer anti-coag
   - plastics -> cont dressing changes/wound care, ? to OR for evacuation
   and wash out of right breast hematoma
   - plastics rec antibiotics ppx so that hematoma does not get infected

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 51F s/p recent PEA arrest from massive PE now
   presenting to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] in ther setting of falling HCTs and BRBPR in the
   setting of a Heparin gtt.
   .
   #: HCT Drop: Pt remains hemodynamically stable with SBPs in 140s, HR
   finally down to . Yesterday had first non-bloody BM, patient had
   sigmoid source on RBC scan, but refused colonoscopy.  Now s/p IVC
   filter.  Last Xfusion was [**1-30**] at 9:10 AM
   - Maintain access via Power PICC
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks, tighten checks if bloody BM
   - Non-bloody BM yesterday
   - GI Consult
 PT refuses scope
   - CT Torso  - showed right breast hematoma, some ileal/jejunal
   thickening
   - IV PPi
   - Type and Cross 4 units at all time pRBCs
   - LENIs-Negative
   - Would hold off on A/C until HCT stable for 48 hours
   .
   #: PE: PT remains hemodynmically stable. Now s/p IVC filter, would
   Ideally like to anticoagulate for 3-6 months, however will hold of
   pending above
   - Lenis negative
   .
   #: Bilateral Breast Reduction Sugery: Being following by plastics. Per
   report hematoma at right breast.
   - Rt breast wound packed s/p drainage of hematoma
   - asked for ppx abx
 re-starting levaquin
   - Packed with surgicell, wrapped with compressive dressing
   - NS WTD dressing to wounds [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #: [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6 today from 1.7 yesterday, unclear baseline but was 1.6
   on admission which peaked at 3.0. Pt continues to make good UOP. Likely
   ATN following hypotensive event.  This likely represents her baseline.
   - Cont to trend
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   .
   #: Hypertension: Pt on Lisinopril 20mg as outpatient. Have held
   antihypertensives while in house given given Hct drop and PE. Continue
   to trend.  Would restart once HCT stable for 48 hours.
   - Restart ACEi at lower dose once Hct stabilizes and renal function
   improves
   - Will tolerate higher blood pressures in the setting of her GI bleed
   .
   #  AMS: Pt remains A+Ox3 with neuro with improving short term memory
   deficits from hypoxia/hypoperfusion, sedation.   Concern for some ICU
   delerium at night
   - Continue to monitor and trend
   - will continue to monitor neuro exam
   - minimize sedation medications; will space out dilaudid prn
   - haldol PRN for agitation
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female who has recently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently admitted to the ICU and is being managed for several medical complications.

1. The patient's hemoglobin (HCT) levels have been dropping, and she is showing signs of blood loss. Her blood pressure is stable, but she has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be contributing to the HCT drop. It is important to monitor her blood pressure and hematocrit levels closely and consider transfusions if necessary.

2. The patient has a right breast hematoma, likely due to a recent surgery for bilateral breast reduction. The wound is currently packed and wrapped with a compressive dressing. Antibiotics prophylaxis has been started, and the patient is being followed by the plastics team for further management.

3. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is elevated at 1.6 today from 1.7 yesterday. It is unclear if this is a baseline value or a result of the recent hypotensive event. Given the patient's history of an acute kidney injury (ATN) following hypotension, it is important to avoid nephrotoxins and continue to trend the creatinine levels.

4. The patient has a history of hypertension but has been holding antihypertensive medications while in the hospital due to the recent PE and H"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 51F s/p recent PEA arrest from massive PE now
   presenting to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] in ther setting of falling HCTs and BRBPR in the
   setting of a Heparin gtt.
   .
   #: HCT Drop: Pt remains hemodynamically stable with SBPs in 140s, HR
   finally down to . Yesterday had first non-bloody BM, patient had
   sigmoid source on RBC scan, but refused colonoscopy.  Now s/p IVC
   filter
   - Maintain access via Power PICC
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks, tighten checks if bloody BM
   - Non-bloody BM yesterday
   - GI Consult
 PT refuses scope
   - CT Torso  - showed right breast hematoma, some ileal/jejunal
   thickening
   - IV PPi
   - Type and Cross 4 units at all time pRBCs
   - LENIs-Negative
   - Would hold off on A/C until HCT stable for 48 hours
   .
   #: PE: PT remains hemodynmically stable. Now s/p IVC filter, would
   Ideally like to anticoagulate for 3-6 months, however will hold of
   pending above
   - Lens negative
   .
   #: [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6 today from 1.7 yesterday, unclear baseline but was 1.6
   on admission which peaked at 3.0. Pt continues to make good UOP. Likely
   ATN following hypotensive event.  This likely represents her baseline.
   - Cont to trend
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   .
   #: Hypertension: Pt on Lisinopril 20mg as outpatient. Have held
   antihypertensives while in house given given Hct drop and PE. Continue
   to trend.  Would restart once HCT stable for 48 hours.
   - Restart ACEi at lower dose once Hct stabilizes and renal function
   improves
   - Will tolerate higher blood pressures in the setting of her GI bleed
   .
   #  AMS: Pt remains AOx3 with neuro some likely with short term memory
   deficits from hypoxia/hypoperfusion, sedation.   Concern for some ICU
   delerium at night
   - Continue to monitor and trend
   - will continue to monitor neuro exam
   - minimize sedation medications; will space out dilaudid prn
   - haldol PRN for agitation
   .
   #: Bilateral Breast Reduction Sugery: Being following by plastics. Per
   report hematoma at right breast.
   - Rt breast wound packed s/p drainage of hematoma
   - Packed with surgicell, wrapped with compressive dressing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female who experienced a recent pulmonary embolism arrest and is now in the ICU. The patient has several medical conditions and complications:

1. Falling hemoglobin levels (HCT drop): The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, indicating possible internal bleeding or ongoing blood loss. This needs to be investigated and managed promptly to prevent further complications.

2. Blood in the stool (BRBPR): The presence of blood in the patient's stool suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be related to the sigmoid source identified on a recent red blood cell scan. The patient refused a colonoscopy to identify and treat the source of bleeding.

3. Heparin gtt: The patient has been receiving heparin, an anticoagulant medication. However, due to the recent bleeding episodes, it may be necessary to hold off on anticoagulation until the patient's hemoglobin levels stabilize.

4. Right breast hematoma: The patient has a hematoma in her right breast, which was identified on a CT torso scan. This will require further evaluation and management by the plastics team.

5. Hypotensive event: The patient experienced a hypotensive event, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine levels. The current creatinine level is 1.6, which is lower than the previous peak of 3.0 but still indicative of impaired renal function. Close monitoring and avoidance of"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 51F s/p recent PEA arrest from massive PE now
   presenting to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] in ther setting of falling HCTs and BRBPR in the
   setting of a Heparin gtt.
   .
   #: HCT Drop: Pt remains hemodynamically stable with SBPs in 140s, HR
   finally down to . Yesterday had first non-bloody BM, patient had
   sigmoid source on RBC scan, but refused colonoscopy.  Now s/p IVC
   filter
   - Maintain access via Power PICC
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks, tighten checks if bloody BM
   - Non-bloody BM yesterday
   - GI Consult
 PT refuses scope
   - CT Torso  - showed right breast hematoma, some ileal/jejunal
   thickening
   - IV PPi
   - Type and Cross 4 units at all time pRBCs
   - LENIs-Negative
   - Would hold off on A/C until HCT stable for 48 hours
   .
   #: PE: PT remains hemodynmically stable. Now s/p IVC filter, would
   Ideally like to anticoagulate for 3-6 months, however will hold of
   pending above
   - Lenis negative
   .
   #: Bilateral Breast Reduction Sugery: Being following by plastics. Per
   report hematoma at right breast.
   - Rt breast wound packed s/p drainage of hematoma
   - asked for ppx abx
 re-starting levaquin
   - Packed with surgicell, wrapped with compressive dressing
   - NS WTD dressing to wounds [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #: [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6 today from 1.7 yesterday, unclear baseline but was 1.6
   on admission which peaked at 3.0. Pt continues to make good UOP. Likely
   ATN following hypotensive event.  This likely represents her baseline.
   - Cont to trend
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   .
   #: Hypertension: Pt on Lisinopril 20mg as outpatient. Have held
   antihypertensives while in house given given Hct drop and PE. Continue
   to trend.  Would restart once HCT stable for 48 hours.
   - Restart ACEi at lower dose once Hct stabilizes and renal function
   improves
   - Will tolerate higher blood pressures in the setting of her GI bleed
   .
   #  AMS: Pt remains A+Ox3 with neuro with improving short term memory
   deficits from hypoxia/hypoperfusion, sedation.   Concern for some ICU
   delerium at night
   - Continue to monitor and trend
   - will continue to monitor neuro exam
   - minimize sedation medications; will space out dilaudid prn
   - haldol PRN for agitation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female who experienced a recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently in the ICU and presenting with falling hematocrit (HCT) levels and bilateral red blood cell (RBC) scans indicating a possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has refused a colonoscopy to identify the source of the bleed.

The patient also has a right breast hematoma and is being followed by the plastics team. She underwent bilateral breast reduction surgery, but developed a hematoma in the right breast. The surgical wound has been packed, and antibiotics prophylaxis has been started.

The patient's renal function is a concern, as her serum creatinine (Cr) level has fluctuated between 1.6 and 3.0 mg/dL. It is believed to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following a hypotensive event. The plan is to continue monitoring the trend and avoid nephrotoxins.

Regarding blood pressure management, the patient's hypertension medication has been held due to her recent pulmonary embolism and falling HCT levels. Once her HCT stabilizes for 48 hours, the plan is to restart angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) at a lower dose and once renal function improves.

The patient's mental status has improved, but there are concerns for short-term memory deficits from hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is in the ICU and has a history of sigmoid hemorrhage. They have been advised to restart anticoagulation if they are preparing for a colonoscopy. However, the patient declined the preparation, so they will continue to defer anticoagulation. The patient also has a right breast hematoma, which may require evacuation and washout. The patient is allergic to penicillins, Macrobid (Oral), and Betadine (Topical). 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 141/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 113 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,690 mL and output of 2,670 mL. 

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not being done, skin not being assessed, and neurologic examination not being assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as decreased platelet count and albumin level. Other lab results are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC line inserted on 01/29/2129), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has full"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 51F s/p recent PEA arrest from massive PE now
   presenting to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] in ther setting of falling HCTs and BRBPR in the
   setting of a Heparin gtt.
   .
   #: HCT Drop: Pt remains hemodynamically stable with SBPs in 140s, HR
   finally down to . Yesterday had first non-bloody BM, patient had
   sigmoid source on RBC scan, but refused colonoscopy.  Now s/p IVC
   filter.  Last Xfusion was [**1-30**] at 9:10 AM
   - Maintain access via Power PICC
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks, tighten checks if bloody BM
   - Non-bloody BM yesterday
   - GI Consult
 PT refuses scope
   - CT Torso  - showed right breast hematoma, some ileal/jejunal
   thickening
   - IV PPi
   - Type and Cross 4 units at all time pRBCs
   - LENIs-Negative
   - Would hold off on A/C until HCT stable for 48 hours
   .
   #: PE: PT remains hemodynmically stable. Now s/p IVC filter, would
   Ideally like to anticoagulate for 3-6 months, however will hold of
   pending above
   - Lenis negative
   .
   #: Bilateral Breast Reduction Sugery: Being following by plastics. Per
   report hematoma at right breast.
   - Rt breast wound packed s/p drainage of hematoma
   - asked for ppx abx
 re-starting levaquin
   - Packed with surgicell, wrapped with compressive dressing
   - NS WTD dressing to wounds [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #: [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6 today from 1.7 yesterday, unclear baseline but was 1.6
   on admission which peaked at 3.0. Pt continues to make good UOP. Likely
   ATN following hypotensive event.  This likely represents her baseline.
   - Cont to trend
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   .
   #: Hypertension: Pt on Lisinopril 20mg as outpatient. Have held
   antihypertensives while in house given given Hct drop and PE. Continue
   to trend.  Would restart once HCT stable for 48 hours.
   - Restart ACEi at lower dose once Hct stabilizes and renal function
   improves
   - Will tolerate higher blood pressures in the setting of her GI bleed
   .
   #  AMS: Pt remains A+Ox3 with neuro with improving short term memory
   deficits from hypoxia/hypoperfusion, sedation.   Concern for some ICU
   delerium at night
   - Continue to monitor and trend
   - will continue to monitor neuro exam
   - minimize sedation medications; will space out dilaudid prn
   - haldol PRN for agitation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female who experienced a recent cardiac arrest due to a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions and complications:

1. Falling hematocrit (HCT) levels and blood pressure (BRBPR): The patient's HCT levels have been decreasing, indicating potential ongoing internal bleeding. This, combined with her low blood pressure, suggests the possibility of another GI bleed.

2. Heparin infusion: The patient is receiving heparin, an anticoagulant medication, which could contribute to the risk of bleeding.

3. Refusal of colonoscopy: Despite a sigmoid source of bleeding identified on a red blood cell scan, the patient has declined a colonoscopy to further investigate and potentially treat the source of bleeding.

4. IVC filter placement: The patient has undergone an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement to prevent further pulmonary embolisms. However, this also increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and associated complications.

5. Right breast hematoma: The patient has a hematoma in her right breast, which may require surgical intervention. Antibiotics have been prescribed as prophylaxis against infection.

6. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.6 to 3.0, indicating potential acute kidney injury, likely secondary to hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 51F s/p recent PEA arrest from massive PE now
   presenting to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] in ther setting of falling HCTs and BRBPR in the
   setting of a Heparin gtt.
   .
   #: HCT Drop: Pt remains hemodynamically stable with SBPs in 140s, HR
   finally down to . Yesterday had first non-bloody BM, patient had
   sigmoid source on RBC scan, but refused colonoscopy.  Now s/p IVC
   filter.  Last Xfusion was [**1-30**] at 9:10 AM
   - Maintain access via Power PICC
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT checks, tighten checks if bloody BM
   - Non-bloody BM yesterday
   - GI Consult
 PT refuses scope
   - CT Torso  - showed right breast hematoma, some ileal/jejunal
   thickening
   - IV PPi
   - Type and Cross 4 units at all time pRBCs
   - LENIs-Negative
   - Would hold off on A/C until HCT stable for 48 hours
   .
   #: PE: PT remains hemodynmically stable. Now s/p IVC filter, would
   Ideally like to anticoagulate for 3-6 months, however will hold of
   pending above
   - Lenis negative
   .
   #: Bilateral Breast Reduction Sugery: Being following by plastics. Per
   report hematoma at right breast.
   - Rt breast wound packed s/p drainage of hematoma
   - asked for ppx abx
 re-starting levaquin
   - Packed with surgicell, wrapped with compressive dressing
   - NS WTD dressing to wounds [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #: [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6 today from 1.7 yesterday, unclear baseline but was 1.6
   on admission which peaked at 3.0. Pt continues to make good UOP. Likely
   ATN following hypotensive event.  This likely represents her baseline.
   - Cont to trend
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   .
   #: Hypertension: Pt on Lisinopril 20mg as outpatient. Have held
   antihypertensives while in house given given Hct drop and PE. Continue
   to trend.  Would restart once HCT stable for 48 hours.
   - Restart ACEi at lower dose once Hct stabilizes and renal function
   improves
   - Will tolerate higher blood pressures in the setting of her GI bleed
   .
   #  AMS: Pt remains A+Ox3 with neuro with improving short term memory
   deficits from hypoxia/hypoperfusion, sedation.   Concern for some ICU
   delerium at night
   - Continue to monitor and trend
   - will continue to monitor neuro exam
   - minimize sedation medications; will space out dilaudid prn
   - haldol PRN for agitation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female who experienced a recent pulmonary embolism (PE) arrest and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has a history of hypertension and is on lisinopril 20mg as an outpatient. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 141/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows stable blood pressure and heart rate.

The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and a distended abdomen. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelets (Plt). The patient's creatinine (Cr) level has decreased from 3.0 mg/dL on admission to 1.6 mg/dL today. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues. Firstly, the patient's hematocrit (Hct) drop is being monitored, and the blood pressure remains stable. The patient has a history of a massive PE and subsequent pulmonary infarction, leading to a drop in Hct. The patient refuses a colonoscopy to identify the source of bleeding. Secondly, the patient recently underwent bilateral breast reduction surgery"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged woman who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's condition has improved, and she is now able to sit comfortably in a chair. Her neurological status is also slowly improving. However, there are concerns regarding when to perform a colonoscopy and when to restart anticoagulation therapy. The patient is anxious to start eating and is currently receiving full nutrition. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, Macrobid, and Betadine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, which may have resulted in significant blood loss leading to anemia. This could cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE), acute: Given the patient's recent PEA arrest and immobilization due to ICU stay, there is a risk of developing a blood clot in the lungs (PE). Symptoms may include shortness of breath, chest pain, and low oxygen levels.
3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient has been noted to have low blood pressure on multiple occasions. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Alteration in tissue perfusion: The patient's low blood pressure and potential hypovolemia due to bleeding may compromise blood flow to organs"
