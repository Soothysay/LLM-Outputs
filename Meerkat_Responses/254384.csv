   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: On admission, pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
   non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock. Pt does
   have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L, likely transudate but can hide
   infectious consolidations. PNA Has heart failure. Could have ARDS but
   unlikely (does not fit the definition)
   -  Pressure support trials as tolerated-  reduce sedation (fentanyl,
   versed) and use zyprexa SL for agitation; if pt has difficulty being
   weaned down on ventilator, consider therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel sounds, PNA, endocarditis (poor
   dentition).
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down)
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff toxin test pending (no BM since
   admission). Will give PR laxative to facilitate process. Continue PO
   Vanc and IV flagyl for empiric therapy of C. diff
   - Continue IV Vanc and ceftriaxone for broad empiric coverage in case
   the source of infection is not C. diff
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Cardiac: Trop peaked at 0.31, now on a downward trend; most likely
   demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow
   limiting lesions per patient. Echo done; no evidence of new areas of
   dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 2.0)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.
   - Monitor; will
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: ? converting to acute leukemia
   - check for blasts
   - hold hydroxyurea
   - Heme/Onc c/s in AM
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.4, baseline 1.2 ish.
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:
   -  EKG
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase v-pacing to 90. Will
   re-consult PRN.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%)
   -  Check Echo
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  HTN:
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy
   -  Check DIC labs
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes
   -  AST higher than ALT; pt apparently stopped drinking 20+ years ago.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to cardiac ischemia and subsequent cell death.
   -  Will be able to visualize liver and check for cirrhosis when CT
   done
   -  Side effect of medication?
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism
   -  Check TSH and Free T4
   -  Continue home dose synthroid in the mean time.
   .
   #  Steroids: will continue for now as pt could have meningitis (esp.
   pneumococcal) and because pt received etomidate for intubation which
   can cause adrenal insufficiency.
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no heparin SQ (INR 2.0), H2 blocker.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic pleural effusion, heart failure, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia. He requires norepinephrine for blood pressure support and has been agitated, attempting to remove the endotracheal tube. Sedation has been increased. The patient also requires intermittent bear-hugger therapy for hypothermia. He received about 2 liters of intravenous fluids.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially hypoxic and required intubation. His chronic pleural effusion may hide infectious consolidations.
2. Septic Shock/Fever: The source of infection is unclear, but top differentials include recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel sounds, pneumonia, and endocarditis.
3. Cardiac Issues: The patient's Troponin levels peaked at 0.31 and are now trending downward, suggesting demand ischemia. A cardiac catheterization three years ago showed no flow-limiting lesions.
4. Change in Mental Status: The patient tends to become delirious during acute illnesses or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.
5. Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: The patient has a history of this condition, which may be converting to acute leukemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: On admission, pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
   non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock. Pt does
   have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L, likely transudate but can hide
   infectious consolidations. PNA Has heart failure. Could have ARDS but
   unlikely (does not fit the definition)
   -  Pressure support trials as tolerated-  reduce sedation (fentanyl,
   versed) and use zyprexa SL for agitation; if pt has difficulty being
   weaned down on ventilator, consider therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel sounds, PNA, endocarditis (poor
   dentition).
   - C. diff pending; pt has not had a BM since admission. Will give PR
   laxative to facilitate process. Continue PO Vanc and IV flagyl for
   eminclude meningitis (AMS, high fevers), C. diff (pt has h/o C. diff
   colitis, currently has abdominal pain and high WBC count), and PNA.
   -  Vanc/Zosyn/Ceftriaxone/Decadron given in the ED; Ampicillin
   (Listeria), Acyclovir (HSV), and Flagyl (pt h/o C. diff) given on
   admission to ICU. Would continue Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Amp/Acyclovir and
   Flagyl and add PO Vanco. Need to call for ID approval in AM for
   ceftriaxone 2 g.
   -  CT torso to check for any foci of infection
   -  LP after giving FFP for coagulopathy
   -  Narrow down abx coverage once we have more data regarding etiology
   -  Follow CVP and pulse pressure as a surrogate marker of volume status
   and adequate resuscitation
   -  check central venous sat to check for cardiogenic and septic
   components of shock
   -  Check stool c. diff toxin and culture
   .
   #  Cardiac: Trop 0.10->0.19->0.26; Differential include demand ischemia
   and ACS. Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting
   lesions per patient
   -  325mg Asa
   -  Follow CEs and EKGs
   -  Echo
   -  Cards consult
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 2.0)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.
   - Likely due to
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: ? converting to acute leukemia
   - check for blasts
   - hold hydroxyurea
   - Heme/Onc c/s in AM
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.4, baseline 1.2 ish.
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:
   -  EKG
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase v-pacing to 90. Will
   re-consult PRN.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%)
   -  Check Echo
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  HTN:
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy
   -  Check DIC labs
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes
   -  AST higher than ALT; pt apparently stopped drinking 20+ years ago.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to cardiac ischemia and subsequent cell death.
   -  Will be able to visualize liver and check for cirrhosis when CT
   done
   -  Side effect of medication?
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism
   -  Check TSH and Free T4
   -  Continue home dose synthroid in the mean time.
   .
   #  Steroids: will continue for now as pt could have meningitis (esp.
   pneumococcal) and because pt received etomidate for intubation which
   can cause adrenal insufficiency.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic kidney disease stage 3, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented with complaints of shortness of breath, weakness, and confusion. On examination, the patient had hypotension, tachycardia, and bilateral pleural effusions. Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He was also started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. A cardiac echo revealed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40%. The patient's condition has remained relatively stable since admission, with fluctuations in vital signs and laboratory values. The patient continues to receive aggressive treatment and supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's ejection fraction is reduced (40%), indicating compromised heart function. This increases the risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection. The patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus type 2 makes him more susceptible to"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor antagonists. They also experienced nausea and vomiting after taking cephalexin.

- The patient received various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, metronidazole, ampicillin, and acyclovir, on different dates.

- The patient is currently on midazolam, fentanyl, and norepinephrine infusions in the ICU.

- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for some additional information.

- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/51 mmHg to 146/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg, with a total fluid input of 8,567 mL and output of 2,920 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of 5,647 mL.

- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a volume-controlled mode, set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The plateau pressure is 15 cmH2O, compliance is 50 cmH2O/mL, and the patient's SpO2 is 100%.

- The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, HCO3- of 22 mEq/L, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 342, and ventilation rate of 11.9 L/min.

- Physical examination reveals diaphoresis, poor dentition, a normal heart murmur, diminished pulses in both lower extremities, symmetric chest expansion with bilateral crackles, a distended abdomen with tenderness in the left lower quadrant, and absent pulses in the lower extremities without cyanosis or clubbing.

- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 38.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels of 36.6% and 34.5%, platelet count (Plt) of 400,000/mm3, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.4 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.31 ng/mL, and elevated lactate level of 2.4 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges or show no significant abnormalities.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's echocardiogram shows moderate dilated left atrium, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with global hypokinesis, and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. The increased LV filling pressure and presence of mild aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR) suggest potential cardiac dysfunction.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is supported by mechanical ventilation. The ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation but respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation. The presence of bilateral crackles on lung auscultation may suggest pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has evidence of abdominal distention and tenderness, particularly in the left lower quadrant. This could indicate bowel ischemia or infarction, which may be related to the presence of colitis and pleural effusions.

4. Renal complications: The elevated creatinine level suggests renal dysfunction, which may be due to pre-existing kidney disease or acute kidney injury caused by hypotension, sepsis, or medication toxicity.

5. Peripheral arterial complications: The diminished pulses"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt was hypoxic to low 90s on non-rebreather.
   Likely due to septic shock. PNA is questionable as there are no
   discrete patches of infiltrate - more diffuse haziness bilaterally. Has
   heart failure. Could have ARDS although plateau pressure is low. Pt has
   chronic pleural effusion R>L, which can hide consolidations.
   -  Intubated, sedated.
   -  ARDSnet protocol
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   meningitis (AMS, high fevers), C. diff (pt has h/o C. diff colitis,
   currently has abdominal pain and high WBC count), and PNA.
   -  Vanc/Zosyn/Ceftriaxone/Decadron given in the ED; Ampicillin
   (Listeria), Acyclovir (HSV), and Flagyl (pt h/o C. diff) given on
   admission to ICU. Would continue Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Amp/Acyclovir and
   Flagyl and add PO Vanco. Need to call for ID approval in AM for
   ceftriaxone 2 g.
   -  CT torso to check for any foci of infection
   -  LP after giving FFP for coagulopathy
   -  Narrow down abx coverage once we have more data regarding etiology
   -  Follow CVP and pulse pressure as a surrogate marker of volume status
   and adequate resuscitation
   -  check central venous sat to check for cardiogenic and septic
   components of shock
   -  Check stool c. diff toxin and culture
   .
   #  Cardiac: Trop 0.10->0.19->0.26; Differential include demand ischemia
   and ACS. Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting
   lesions per patient
   -  325mg Asa
   -  Follow CEs and EKGs
   -  Echo
   -  Cards consult
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 2.0)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.
   -  Head CT w/o contrast to r/o bleed (coagulapathic)
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: ? converting to acute leukemia
   - check for blasts
   - hold hydroxyurea
   - Heme/Onc c/s in AM
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.4, baseline 1.2 ish.
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:
   -  EKG
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase v-pacing to 90. Will
   re-consult PRN.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%)
   -  Check Echo
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  HTN:
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy
   -  Check DIC labs
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes
   -  AST higher than ALT; pt apparently stopped drinking 20+ years ago.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to cardiac ischemia and subsequent cell death.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with septic shock and respiratory failure. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical conditions including idiopathic myelofibrosis, PAF with pacemaker, CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, coagulopathy, elevated liver enzymes, hypothyroidism, and a history of sulfonamide allergy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate respiratory failure, which could be due to septic shock or pneumonia.
2. Septic shock: The patient's high fever and unstable blood pressure suggest septic shock, possibly caused by an unidentified source of infection. Common differentials include meningitis, C. diff colitis, and pneumonia.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and his cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or acute coronary syndrome.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are increasing, suggesting acute renal failure. This may be due to sepsis, hypoperfusion, or underlying chronic kidney disease.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR and decreased platelet count, indicating coagulopathy. This could be related to sepsis or his underlying myelofibrosis.
6. Liver enzyme abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes are"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt was hypoxic to low 90s on non-rebreather.
   Likely due to septic shock. PNA is questionable as there are no
   discrete patches of infiltrate - more diffuse haziness bilaterally. Has
   heart failure. Could have ARDS although plateau pressure is low. Pt has
   chronic pleural effusion R>L, which can hide consolidations.
   -  Intubated, sedated.
   -  ARDSnet protocol
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   meningitis (AMS, high fevers), C. diff (pt has h/o C. diff colitis,
   currently has abdominal pain and high WBC count), and PNA.
   -  Vanc/Zosyn/Ceftriaxone/Decadron given in the ED; Ampicillin
   (Listeria), Acyclovir (HSV), and Flagyl (pt h/o C. diff) given on
   admission to ICU. Would continue Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Amp/Acyclovir and
   Flagyl and add PO Vanco. Need to call for ID approval in AM for
   ceftriaxone 2 g.
   -  CT torso to check for any foci of infection
   -  LP after giving FFP for coagulopathy
   -  Narrow down abx coverage once we have more data regarding etiology
   -  Follow CVP and pulse pressure as a surrogate marker of volume status
   and adequate resuscitation
   -  check central venous sat to check for cardiogenic and septic
   components of shock
   -  Check stool c. diff toxin and culture
   .
   #  Cardiac: Trop 0.10->0.19->0.26; Differential include demand ischemia
   and ACS. Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting
   lesions per patient
   -  325mg Asa
   -  Follow CEs and EKGs
   -  Echo
   -  Cards consult
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 2.0)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.
   -  Head CT w/o contrast to r/o bleed (coagulapathic)
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: ? converting to acute leukemia
   - check for blasts
   - hold hydroxyurea
   - Heme/Onc c/s in AM
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.4, baseline 1.2 ish.
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:
   -  EKG
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase v-pacing to 90. Will
   re-consult PRN.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%)
   -  Check Echo
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  HTN:
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy
   -  Check DIC labs
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes
   -  AST higher than ALT; pt apparently stopped drinking 20+ years ago.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to cardiac ischemia and subsequent cell death.
   -  Will be able to visualize liver and check for cirrhosis when CT
   done

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical conditions and complications. The summary of the patient's health progress includes:

- The patient was admitted with septic shock and respiratory failure.
- He has a history of idiopathic myelofibrosis, which may be converting to acute leukemia.
- The patient has a pacemaker for PAF and has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%.
- He also has a history of HTN, PVD, coagulopathy, and elevated liver enzymes.
- Other issues include hypothyroidism, potential cardiac ischemia, and a history of chronic alcoholism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. There is a possibility of further deterioration in lung function leading to worsening respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient was admitted with septic shock, and the source of infection is unclear. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent recurrence or progression of sepsis.

3. Cardiac Ischemia/ACS: The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes and a history of cardiac catheterization showing no flow-limiting lesions. There is a possibility of ongoing cardiac ischemia or acute coronary syndrome.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.2 to 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: On admission, pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
   non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock. PNA is
   questionable as there are no discrete patches of infiltrate - more
   diffuse haziness bilaterally. Has heart failure. Could have ARDS
   although plateau pressure is low. Pt has chronic pleural effusion R>L,
   which can hide consolidations.
   -  Intubated, sedated.
   -  ARDSnet protocol
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   meningitis (AMS, high fevers), C. diff (pt has h/o C. diff colitis,
   currently has abdominal pain and high WBC count), and PNA.
   -  Vanc/Zosyn/Ceftriaxone/Decadron given in the ED; Ampicillin
   (Listeria), Acyclovir (HSV), and Flagyl (pt h/o C. diff) given on
   admission to ICU. Would continue Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Amp/Acyclovir and
   Flagyl and add PO Vanco. Need to call for ID approval in AM for
   ceftriaxone 2 g.
   -  CT torso to check for any foci of infection
   -  LP after giving FFP for coagulopathy
   -  Narrow down abx coverage once we have more data regarding etiology
   -  Follow CVP and pulse pressure as a surrogate marker of volume status
   and adequate resuscitation
   -  check central venous sat to check for cardiogenic and septic
   components of shock
   -  Check stool c. diff toxin and culture
   .
   #  Cardiac: Trop 0.10->0.19->0.26; Differential include demand ischemia
   and ACS. Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting
   lesions per patient
   -  325mg Asa
   -  Follow CEs and EKGs
   -  Echo
   -  Cards consult
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 2.0)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.
   - Likely due to
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: ? converting to acute leukemia
   - check for blasts
   - hold hydroxyurea
   - Heme/Onc c/s in AM
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.4, baseline 1.2 ish.
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:
   -  EKG
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase v-pacing to 90. Will
   re-consult PRN.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%)
   -  Check Echo
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  HTN:
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy
   -  Check DIC labs
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes
   -  AST higher than ALT; pt apparently stopped drinking 20+ years ago.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to cardiac ischemia and subsequent cell death.
   -  Will be able to visualize liver and check for cirrhosis when CT
   done
   -  Side effect of medication?
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism
   -  Check TSH and Free T4
   -  Continue home dose synthroid in the mean time.
   .
   #  Steroids: will continue for now as pt could have meningitis (esp.
   pneumococcal) and because pt received etomidate for intubation which
   can cause adrenal insufficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted with septic shock and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of idiopathic myelofibrosis, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure (ejection fraction of 45%), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. The patient also has a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. He has received broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the source of infection is still unclear. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and there is a concern for delirium or meningitis. His coagulation profile is abnormal, indicating a possible coagulopathy. The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to cardiac ischemia or medication side effects. Other concerns include acute on chronic renal failure, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and possible acute leukemia transformation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a progression of pneumonia or if the mechanical ventilation settings are not optimized.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock could progress if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an ongoing infection. Identifying the source of infection and initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: On admission, pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
   non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock. Pt does
   have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L, likely transudate but can hide
   infectious consolidations. PNA Has heart failure. Could have ARDS but
   unlikely (does not fit the definition)
   -  Pressure support trials as tolerated-  reduce sedation (fentanyl,
   versed) and use zyprexa SL for agitation; if pt has difficulty being
   weaned down on ventilator, consider therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel sounds, PNA, endocarditis (poor
   dentition).
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down)
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff toxin test pending (no BM since
   admission). Will give PR laxative to facilitate process. Continue PO
   Vanc and IV flagyl for empiric therapy of C. diff
   - Continue IV Vanc and ceftriaxone for broad empiric coverage in case
   the source of infection is not C. diff
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Cardiac: Trop peaked at 0.31, now on a downward trend; most likely
   demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow
   limiting lesions per patient. Echo done; no evidence of new areas of
   dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 2.0)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with septic shock and respiratory failure. He was intubated due to hypoxia. He has a history of chronic pleural effusion, likely transudate, but can hide infectious consolidations. He also has heart failure and may have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but it is unlikely. The source of infection is unclear, with differentials including recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff), ischemic bowel sounds, pneumonia, and endocarditis. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, suggesting demand ischemia. There are no new areas of dysfunction on the echocardiogram. The patient is coagulopathic with an INR of 2.0 and has a tendency to become delirious during acute illnesses. Other medical conditions include idiopathic myelofibrosis, chronic renal failure, atrioventricular block with pacemaker, congestive heart failure (ejection fraction of 45%), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, but this may be due to cardiac ischemia or medication side effects. Steroids have been started to help with blood pressure. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, diuretics, and antiplatelet agents."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: On admission, pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
   non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock. Pt does
   have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L. RSBI 141 this AM however during
   rounds, had little respiratory drive. Having difficulty lifting
   sedation due to periods of agitation. Zyprexa had little effect; can
   use haldol due to risk of QT prolongation (490ms at baseline)
   - Decrease set rate of ventilation as pt is somewhat alkelemic at this
   time, and let his own ventilatory drive kick in. Recheck ABG.
   - check old records to see if any other meds have been of use in the
   past when he was agitated.
   - Try Precedex for control of agitation
   -  Pressure support trials as tolerated; if pt has difficulty being
   weaned down on ventilator despite control of agitation and minimization
   of sedation, consider therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel disease, PNA. All microbiology
   studies have been negative
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down). goal MAP>60-65, SBP>90.
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff neg x 1. Given the high suspicion,
   will check again. Continue PO Vanc and IV flagyl for empiric therapy of
   C. diff
   - Continue IV Vanc and ceftriaxone for broad empiric coverage in the
   absence of microbiology data
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Steroids: Cortstim 14.6->19.1. Abnormal in the setting of acute
   illness
   - Started Hydrocort 100 mg Q8 hrs yesterday. Will continue given
   difficulty coming off levophed and the setting of acute illness.
   #  Cardiac: trop leak in the setting of demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3
   years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting lesions per patient. Echo
   done; no evidence of new areas of dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 1.6)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with septic shock and respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic pleural effusion and is currently intubated due to hypoxia. The patient's recent progress includes episodes of agitation, difficulty weaning off sedation, and an elevated white blood cell count. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/56-161/145 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he has negative results for C. difficile toxin and respiratory viral antigens. Imaging shows dense left retrocardiac opacity and decreased right pleural effusion. The patient's conditions include septic shock, fever, respiratory failure, idiopathic myelofibrosis, chronic renal failure, PAF with pacemaker, CHF, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, coagulopathy, elevated liver enzymes, hypothyroidism, and a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if he is unable to be weaned off the ventilator or experiences further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock may worsen if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly. This could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: On admission, pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
   non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock. Pt does
   have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L, likely transudate but can hide
   infectious consolidations. PNA Has heart failure. Could have ARDS but
   unlikely (does not fit the definition)
   -  Pressure support trials as tolerated-  reduce sedation (fentanyl,
   versed) and use zyprexa SL for agitation; if pt has difficulty being
   weaned down on ventilator, consider therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel sounds, PNA, endocarditis (poor
   dentition).
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down)
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff toxin test pending (no BM since
   admission). Will give PR laxative to facilitate process. Continue PO
   Vanc and IV flagyl for empiric therapy of C. diff
   - Continue IV Vanc and ceftriaxone for broad empiric coverage in case
   the source of infection is not C. diff
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Cardiac: Trop peaked at 0.31, now on a downward trend; most likely
   demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow
   limiting lesions per patient. Echo done; no evidence of new areas of
   dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 2.0)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.
   - Will check again once less sedated
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: pt
s outpt hematologist visited pt
   informally
   - hold hydroxyurea/interferon
   .
   #  Chronic renal failure: Cr 1.3, baseline 1.2 ish.
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:  stable, rate well-controlled. V-paced at this
   time.
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase ventricular demand
   pacing to 90. Will re-consult PRN.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%): Repeat echo showing stable EF.
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  h/o HTN
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy: INR near 2.
   -  unclear etiology
   - site of RIJ oozing continuously -> will place a PICC instead and pull
   the line and send tip for Cx
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes; stable transaminases, T.bili improved
   -  AST higher than ALT; pt apparently stopped drinking 20+ years ago.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to cardiac ischemia and subsequent cell death.
   -  Side effect of medication?
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH is elevated but Free T4 WNL. Likely sick
   euthyroid in the setting of acute illness.
   -  Continue home dose synthroid
   .
   #  Steroids: Cortstim 14.6->19.1. Abnormal in the setting of acute
   illness
   - Start Hydrocort 100 mg Q8 hrs x 24-48hrs. [**Month (only) 51**] help with blood
   pressure
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no heparin SQ (INR elevated), H2 blocker.
   .
   # Access: 1 [**Last Name (LF) 3173**], [**First Name3 (LF) 133**] place PICC then pull RIJ, A line (placed [**2178-2-9**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of septic shock, respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, idiopathic myelofibrosis, PAF with pacemaker, CHF, h/o HTN, PVD, coagulopathy, elevated liver enzymes, hypothyroidism, and steroids. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has been experiencing delirium and agitation, with fluctuating levels of consciousness. His vital signs are stable, but he has persistent hypotension that requires pressor support. His lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly elevated CRP, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and coagulopathy increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and central venous catheter, which can increase the risk of CRBSI.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and the use of pressors.
5. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating levels of consciousness and agitation may be indicative of delirium"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: On admission, pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
   non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock. Pt does
   have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L, likely transudate but can hide
   infectious consolidations. PNA Has heart failure. Could have ARDS but
   unlikely (does not fit the definition)
   -  Pressure support trials as tolerated-  reduce sedation (fentanyl,
   versed) and use zyprexa SL for agitation; if pt has difficulty being
   weaned down on ventilator, consider therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel sounds, PNA, endocarditis (poor
   dentition).
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down)
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff toxin test pending (no BM since
   admission). Will give PR laxative to facilitate process. Continue PO
   Vanc and IV flagyl for empiric therapy of C. diff
   - Continue IV Vanc and ceftriaxone for broad empiric coverage in case
   the source of infection is not C. diff
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Cardiac: Trop peaked at 0.31, now on a downward trend; most likely
   demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow
   limiting lesions per patient. Echo done; no evidence of new areas of
   dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 2.0)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.
   - Will check again once less sedated
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: pt
s outpt hematologist visited pt
   informally
   - hold hydroxyurea/interferon
   .
   #  Chronic renal failure: Cr 1.3, baseline 1.2 ish.
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:  stable, rate well-controlled. V-paced at this
   time.
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase ventricular demand
   pacing to 90. Will re-consult PRN.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%): Repeat echo showing stable EF.
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  h/o HTN
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy: INR near 2.
   -  unclear etiology
   - site of RIJ oozing continuously -> will place a PICC instead and pull
   the line and send tip for Cx
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes; stable transaminases, T.bili improved
   -  AST higher than ALT; pt apparently stopped drinking 20+ years ago.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to cardiac ischemia and subsequent cell death.
   -  Side effect of medication?
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH is elevated but Free T4 WNL. Likely sick
   euthyroid in the setting of acute illness.
   -  Continue home dose synthroid
   .
   #  Steroids: Cortstim 14.6->19.1. Abnormal in the setting of acute
   illness
   - Start Hydrocort 100 mg Q8 hrs x 24-48hrs. [**Month (only) 51**] help with blood
   pressure
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no heparin SQ (INR elevated), H2 blocker.
   .
   # Access: 1 [**Last Name (LF) 3173**], [**First Name3 (LF) 133**] place PICC then pull RIJ, A line (placed [**2178-2-9**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of septic shock, respiratory failure, and multiple medical conditions including chronic renal failure, idiopathic myelofibrosis, congestive heart failure, peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia. He has a central line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line in place. His vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires vasopressor support. The source of infection is still unclear, with differentials including recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, ischemic bowel sounds, pneumonia, and endocarditis. Imaging shows evidence of colitis, and C. diff toxin testing is pending. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated. There are also concerns about the patient's mental status changes, coagulopathy, and elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to ongoing hypoxia despite being on mechanical ventilation. The possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be monitored for.
2. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors indicate ongoing septic shock. Continued monitoring and management of blood pressure and organ perfusion are"

   ETT little changed, now 6.9 cm above carina, still projecting between
   inferior
   clavicles. OGT still in stomach. Dense left retrocardiac opacity
   persists.
   While lateral-most aspect of lateral sulci are excluded, decreased
   density
   over right lung base and decreased thickening of lateral right pleural
   space
   suggests decreased right pleural effusion, possibly due to interval
   thoracentesis? No definite pneumothorax seen.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: On admission, pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
   non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock. Pt does
   have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L, likely transudate but can hide
   infectious consolidations. PNA Has heart failure. Could have ARDS but
   unlikely (does not fit the definition)
   -  Pressure support trials as tolerated-  reduce sedation (fentanyl,
   versed) and use zyprexa SL for agitation; if pt has difficulty being
   weaned down on ventilator, consider therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel sounds, PNA, endocarditis (poor
   dentition).
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down)
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff toxin test pending (no BM since
   admission). Will give PR laxative to facilitate process. Continue PO
   Vanc and IV flagyl for empiric therapy of C. diff
   - Continue IV Vanc and ceftriaxone for broad empiric coverage in case
   the source of infection is not C. diff
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Cardiac: Trop peaked at 0.31, now on a downward trend; most likely
   demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow
   limiting lesions per patient. Echo done; no evidence of new areas of
   dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 2.0)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Improving.  On admission, pt was hypoxic to low
   90s on non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock.
   Pt does have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L. RSBI 141 this AM however
   during rounds, had little respiratory drive. Had difficulty lifting
   sedation on fentanyl & versed due to periods of agitation. Zyprexa had
   little effect; can
t use haldol due to risk of QT prolongation (490ms
   at baseline).  Did much better overnight on precedex.  Tolerating
   minimal pressure support this morning.
   -  Attempt extubation today
   -  Follow ABG
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel disease, PNA. All microbiology
   studies have been negative to date.
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down). goal MAP>60-65, SBP>90.
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff neg x 2. Given the high suspicion,
   will check again. Continue PO Vanc for empiric therapy of C. diff.
   Will stop IV flagyl ([**2-12**]).  Radiographic results could be changes
   related to his prior episodes of C. diff.  Additional stool studies
   still pending.
   - Continue ceftriaxone for empiric coverage for pneumonia in the
   absence of microbiology data
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Steroids: Cortstim 14.6->19.1. Abnormal in the setting of acute
   illness.  Started Hydrocort 100 mg Q8 hrs [**2-10**]. Will stop on [**2-12**] given
   overall improvement.
   #  Cardiac: trop leak in the setting of demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3
   years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting lesions per patient. Echo
   done; no evidence of new areas of dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 1.6)
   -  Will ask EP to decrease rate of pacemaker as acute illness
   resolving.
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.  Did
   much better on precedex than on fentanyl & versed.  Patient
s prior
   episodes of agitation may be an adverse reaction to benzos.
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: pt

   informally
   - resume hydroxyurea;  hold interferon

   #  Chronic renal failure: at baseline, 1.1
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Follow Cr

   #  PAF with pacemaker:  stable, rate well-controlled. V-paced at this
   time.
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase ventricular demand
   pacing to 90. Will re-consult and ask to decrease rate as patient has
   improved.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Improving.  On admission, pt was hypoxic to low
   90s on non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock.
   Pt does have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L. RSBI 141 this AM however
   during rounds, had little respiratory drive. Had difficulty lifting
   sedation on fentanyl & versed due to periods of agitation. Zyprexa had
   little effect; can
t use haldol due to risk of QT prolongation (490ms
   at baseline).  Did much better overnight on precedex.  Tolerating
   minimal pressure support this morning.
   -  Attempt extubation today
   -  Follow ABG
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel disease, PNA. All microbiology
   studies have been negative to date.
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down). goal MAP>60-65, SBP>90.
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff neg x 2. Given the high suspicion,
   will check again. Continue PO Vanc for empiric therapy of C. diff.
   Will stop IV flagyl ([**2-12**]).  Radiographic results could be changes
   related to his prior episodes of C. diff.  Additional stool studies
   still pending.
   - Continue ceftriaxone for empiric coverage for pneumonia in the
   absence of microbiology data
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Steroids: Cortstim 14.6->19.1. Abnormal in the setting of acute
   illness.  Started Hydrocort 100 mg Q8 hrs [**2-10**]. Will stop on [**2-12**] given
   overall improvement.
   #  Cardiac: trop leak in the setting of demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3
   years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting lesions per patient. Echo
   done; no evidence of new areas of dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 1.6)
   -  Will ask EP to decrease rate of pacemaker as acute illness
   resolving.
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.  Did
   much better on precedex than on fentanyl & versed.  Patient
s prior
   episodes of agitation may be an adverse reaction to benzos.
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: pt
s outpt hematologist visited pt
   informally
   - resume hydroxyurea;  hold interferon
   .
   #  Chronic renal failure: at baseline, 1.1
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:  stable, rate well-controlled. V-paced at this
   time.
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase ventricular demand
   pacing to 90. Will re-consult and ask to decrease rate as patient has
   improved.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%): Repeat echo showing stable EF.
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  h/o HTN
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy: INR near 2.  Patient received vitamin K.  INR now 1.5
   -  unclear etiology
   - site of RIJ oozing continuously -> will place a PICC instead and pull
   the line and send tip for Cx
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes; stable transaminases, T.bili improved
   -  monitor LFTs
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH is elevated but Free T4 WNL. Likely sick
   euthyroid in the setting of acute illness.
   -  Continue home dose synthroid
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, Nutrition consult placed.  TF
   held overnight due to residuals.  Will consider PO diet post-extubation
   if MS improved.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, start HSQ today as INR is now 1.6, H2
   blocker.
   .
   # Access: 1 PIV, RIJ (place [**2178-2-9**]), A line (placed [**2178-2-9**])
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: On admission, pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
   non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock. Pt does
   have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L. RSBI 141 this AM however during
   rounds, had little respiratory drive. Having difficulty lifting
   sedation due to periods of agitation. Zyprexa had little effect; can
   use haldol due to risk of QT prolongation (490ms at baseline)
   - Decrease set rate of ventilation as pt is somewhat alkelemic at this
   time, and let his own ventilatory drive kick in. Recheck ABG.
   - check old records to see if any other meds have been of use in the
   past when he was agitated.
   - Try Precedex for control of agitation
   -  Pressure support trials as tolerated; if pt has difficulty being
   weaned down on ventilator despite control of agitation and minimization
   of sedation, consider therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   -  Follow ABG
   -  Follow imaging.
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel disease, PNA. All microbiology
   studies have been negative
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down). goal MAP>60-65, SBP>90.
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff neg x 1. Given the high suspicion,
   will check again. Continue PO Vanc and IV flagyl for empiric therapy of
   C. diff
   - Continue IV Vanc and ceftriaxone for broad empiric coverage in the
   absence of microbiology data
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Steroids: Cortstim 14.6->19.1. Abnormal in the setting of acute
   illness
   - Started Hydrocort 100 mg Q8 hrs yesterday. Will continue given
   difficulty coming off levophed and the setting of acute illness.
   #  Cardiac: trop leak in the setting of demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3
   years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting lesions per patient. Echo
   done; no evidence of new areas of dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 1.6)
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.
   - see above regarding management of sedation and agitation.
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: pt
s outpt hematologist visited pt
   informally
   - hold hydroxyurea/interferon
   .
   #  Chronic renal failure: at baseline, 1.2
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:  stable, rate well-controlled. V-paced at this
   time.
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase ventricular demand
   pacing to 90. Will re-consult PRN.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%): Repeat echo showing stable EF.
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  h/o HTN
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy: INR near 2.
   -  unclear etiology
   - site of RIJ oozing continuously -> will place a PICC instead and pull
   the line and send tip for Cx
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes; stable transaminases, T.bili improved
   -  monitor LFTs
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH is elevated but Free T4 WNL. Likely sick
   euthyroid in the setting of acute illness.
   -  Continue home dose synthroid
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, start TF today. Nutrition consult
   placed
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, start HSQ today as INR is now 1.6, H2
   blocker.
   .
   # Access: 1 PIV, RIJ (place [**2178-2-9**]), A line (placed [**2178-2-9**])
   .
   # Code: full, confirmed with patient and his wife.
   .
   # Communication: family; HCP is wife [**Doctor First Name 96**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6184**])

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated due to hypoxia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 102/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular-paced, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg.

The patient has several medical conditions, including chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of 1.2, idiopathic myelofibrosis, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, peripheral vascular disease, hypothyroidism, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including sedatives, antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and other supportive care medications. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and a high lactate level.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.

2. Septic shock: The patient is already in septic shock, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. 

Upon arrival, the patient was found to be unresponsive with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation initially due to severe respiratory distress. However, he was successfully extubated today. 

During his ICU stay, the patient received multiple antibiotics including ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone. He also received heparin sodium as a prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. 

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. 

His blood glucose level was within normal range, but his white blood cell count was elevated at 18.8 thousand cells/microliter. His hemoglobin level was slightly decreased at 10.6 grams/dL, and his platelet count was slightly low at 271 thousand cells/microliter. His creatinine level was within normal range, and his potassium level was slightly low at 3.7 milliequivalents/Liter. 

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 175, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 70 milliequivalents/Liter, base excess of -5, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%, and respiratory rate (RR) of 13 breaths per minute. 

The patient's physical examination revealed no abnormalities in his peripheral vascular system, skin, or neurologic function. 

The patient's laboratory results indicated elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin-T. His liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were elevated. 

The patient's assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure, hypotension, and fever of unknown origin. The patient is being closely monitored for any potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was extubated, advanced to an advanced diet, and had a PICC line placed while the central venous catheter (CVC) was removed. The patient's pacer heart rate was decreased to 70 bpm, and Precedex was weaned off. The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and keflex. The patient received various antibiotics over the past few days, including ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone. The patient is currently on heparin sodium infusion for prophylaxis.

Physical examination shows that the patient is intubated, sedated, and not following commands. Vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 125/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced, and central venous pressure is 5 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,300 mL, output of 540 mL, and a positive balance of 1,760 mL. Respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's arterial blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Improving.  On admission, pt was hypoxic to low
   90s on non-rebreather thus was intubated. Likely due to septic shock.
   Pt does have h/o chronic pleural effusion R>L. RSBI 141 this AM however
   during rounds, had little respiratory drive. Had difficulty lifting
   sedation on fentanyl & versed due to periods of agitation. Zyprexa had
   little effect; can
t use haldol due to risk of QT prolongation (490ms
   at baseline).  Did much better overnight on precedex.  Tolerating
   minimal pressure support this morning.
   -  Attempt extubation today
   -  Follow ABG
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Unclear source. Top differentials include
   recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel disease, PNA. All microbiology
   studies have been negative to date.
   - To improve BP, limit sedation and give IVF boluses judiciously (give
   if CVP and UOP also down). goal MAP>60-65, SBP>90.
   - If pressor requirement increases, consider adding vasopressin
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff neg x 2. Given the high suspicion,
   will check again. Continue PO Vanc for empiric therapy of C. diff.
   Will stop IV flagyl ([**2-12**]).  Radiographic results could be changes
   related to his prior episodes of C. diff.  Additional stool studies
   still pending.
   - Continue ceftriaxone for empiric coverage for pneumonia in the
   absence of microbiology data
   - If above investigations negative for source of infection, consider
   diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] for ?empyema (low suspicion though, since fluid is
   free flowing and chronic)
   .
   #  Steroids: Cortstim 14.6->19.1. Abnormal in the setting of acute
   illness.  Started Hydrocort 100 mg Q8 hrs [**2-10**]. Will stop on [**2-12**] given
   overall improvement.
   #  Cardiac: trop leak in the setting of demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3
   years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting lesions per patient. Echo
   done; no evidence of new areas of dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 1.6)
   -  Will ask EP to decrease rate of pacemaker as acute illness
   resolving.
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses; or may be a presenting symptom of meningitis.  Did
   much better on precedex than on fentanyl & versed.  Patient
s prior
   episodes of agitation may be an adverse reaction to benzos.
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: pt
s outpt hematologist visited pt
   informally
   - resume hydroxyurea;  hold interferon
   .
   #  Chronic renal failure: at baseline, 1.1
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:  stable, rate well-controlled. V-paced at this
   time.
   -  EP saw patient, adjusted settings to increase ventricular demand
   pacing to 90. Will re-consult and ask to decrease rate as patient has
   improved.
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%): Repeat echo showing stable EF.
   -  hold lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #  h/o HTN
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of hypotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy: INR near 2.  Patient received vitamin K.  INR now 1.5
   -  unclear etiology
   - site of RIJ oozing continuously -> will place a PICC instead and pull
   the line and send tip for Cx
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes; stable transaminases, T.bili improved
   -  monitor LFTs
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH is elevated but Free T4 WNL. Likely sick
   euthyroid in the setting of acute illness.
   -  Continue home dose synthroid
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, Nutrition consult placed.  TF
   held overnight due to residuals.  Will consider PO diet post-extubation
   if MS improved.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, start HSQ today as INR is now 1.6, H2
   blocker.
   .
   # Access: 1 PIV, RIJ (place [**2178-2-9**]), A line (placed [**2178-2-9**])
   .
   # Code: full, confirmed with patient and his wife.
   .
   # Communication: family; HCP is wife [**Doctor First Name 96**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6184**])

- The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of septic shock and respiratory failure.
- The patient was intubated upon admission due to hypoxia, likely caused by septic shock.
- The patient has a history of chronic pleural effusion, which may be related to his current condition.
- The patient has shown improvement overnight and is tolerating minimal pressure support.
- The plan is to attempt extubation today and follow up with an ABG.
- The patient has an unclear source of infection, with differentials including recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel disease, and PNA.
- The patient has been treated empirically for C. diff and pneumonia, and further investigations are pending.
- The patient's steroids have been stopped since he is showing overall improvement.
- The patient's cardiac condition is stable, with no new areas of dysfunction on the latest echo.
- The patient's mental status has been delirious during acute illnesses, and it is suspected that he may have an adverse reaction to benzodiazepines.
- The patient has a history of idiopathic myelofibrosis and chronic renal failure.
- The patient's pacemaker is functioning well, but the rate may need to be decreased as the patient has improved.
- The patient's congestive heart failure is stable, and diuretics have been withheld"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with MDS and h/o recurrent C diff who presented with
   septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Resolved. Successfully extubated yesterday
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Resolved. Afebrile with stable BP off pressors.
   Unclear source. Top differentials include recurrent C. diff, ischemic
   bowel disease, PNA. All microbiology studies have been negative to
   date.
   - Judicious use of IVF boluses (give if CVP and UOP also down). goal
   MAP>60-65, SBP>90.
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff neg x 2. Given the high suspicion,
   will check again. Continue PO Vanc for empiric therapy of C. diff.  IV
   flagyl stopped [**2-12**].  Radiographic results could be changes related to
   his prior episodes of C. diff.  Additional stool studies still pending.
   - Continue ceftriaxone for empiric coverage for pneumonia in the
   absence of microbiology data
   - Pleural effusions unlikely to be empyema, as they have been chronic;
   also free-flowing.
   .
   #  Steroids: Cortstim 14.6->19.1. Abnormal in the setting of acute
   illness.  Gave 3 days of Hydrocort burst for support while in shock and
   intubated. Stopped yesterday
   #  Cardiac: trop leak in the setting of demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3
   years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting lesions per patient. Echo
   done; no evidence of new areas of dysfunction
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  Hold heparin for now as suspicion of demand ischemia is high and pt
   is already coagulopathic (INR 1.6)
   -  EP decr
d demand pacing to 70 as pt doing better.
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during
   acute illnesses.  Did much better on precedex than on fentanyl &
   versed.  Patient
s prior episodes of agitation may be an adverse
   reaction to benzos.  Will re-examine as pt is now off all sedatives and
   extubated.
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: pt
s outpt hematologist visited pt
   informally; WBC now 51 today (likely more reflective of myelofibrosis
   than infection given overall improvement in pt
s condition)
   - resumed hydroxyurea yesterday;  hold interferon
   .
   #  Chronic renal failure: at baseline, 1.1. UOP not great- may
   autodiurese
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:  stable, V-paced at this time.
   -  Appreciate EP help; demand pacing was increased to 90 on admission
   for shock, then decreased to 70 yesterday as pt doing better
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%): Repeat echo showing stable EF.
   -  hold lasix in the setting of normotension.
   .
   #  h/o HTN
   -  Hold home dose of Toprol XL 25mg daily in the setting of
   normotension
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy: INR near 2.  Patient received vitamin K.  INR now 1.5
   -  unclear etiology
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes; stable transaminases, T.bili improved
   -  monitor LFTs
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH is elevated but Free T4 WNL. Likely sick
   euthyroid in the setting of acute illness.
   -  Continue home dose synthroid
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, Nutrition consult placed.  Now on
   PO diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, start HSQ today as INR is now 1.6, H2
   blocker.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, ischemic bowel disease, and pneumonia. He presented with septic shock and respiratory failure but has now resolved both conditions and was successfully extubated. The source of sepsis remains unclear, with negative microbiology studies so far.

The patient's current issues include:

1. Steroids: Abnormal cortisol levels in the setting of acute illness.
2. Cardiac: Troponin leak likely due to demand ischemia. No new areas of dysfunction on recent echo.
3. Change in Mental Status: Tendency to become delirious during acute illnesses.
4. Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: WBC count of 51, likely reflective of myelofibrosis.
5. Chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine level of 1.1, with poor urine output.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72M with MDS and h/o recurrent C diff who presented with
   septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Resolved. Successfully extubated yesterday
   .
   #  Septic shock/ fever: Resolved. Afebrile with stable BP off pressors.
   Unclear source. Top differentials include recurrent C. diff, ischemic
   bowel disease, PNA (aspiration PNA/pneumonitis). All microbiology
   studies have been negative to date.
   - CT torso showing colitis. C. diff neg x 2. Given the high suspicion,
   will check again. Continue PO Vanc for empiric therapy of C. diff.  IV
   flagyl stopped [**2-12**].  Will need PO vanc for at least 2 weeks after
   finishing ceftriaxone. Consider Vanc taper as well since pt has h/o
   recurrent C. diff
   - Continue ceftriaxone for empiric coverage for pneumonia in the
   absence of microbiology data
 plan for a 10 day course
   - Pleural effusions unlikely to be empyema, as they have been chronic;
   also free-flowing. Will defer thoracentesis for now.
   - Elevated white count today likely related to steroid administration x
   3 days (stopped yesterday) and myelofibrosis (started hydroxylurea
   yesterday)
   .
   #  Steroids: Cortstim 14.6->19.1. Abnormal in the setting of acute
   illness.  Gave 3 days of Hydrocort burst for support while in shock and
   intubated. Stopped yesterday
   #  Cardiac: trop leak in the setting of demand ischemia. Cardiac cath 3
   years ago at [**Hospital1 609**] showed no flow limiting lesions per patient. Echo
   done; no evidence of new areas of dysfunction. Deferred anticoagulation
   with heparin as ACS/plaque rupture unlikely.
   -  Continue 325mg Asa, simva
   -  EP decr
d demand pacing to 70 as pt doing better.
   .
   #  Change in Mental Status: Resolved now off of all sedatives.
   Mentating clearly. Pt has tendency to become delirious during acute
   illnesses.  Did much better on precedex than on fentanyl & versed.
   Patient
s prior episodes of agitation may be an adverse reaction to
   benzos.
   .
   #  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: pt
s outpt hematologist visited pt
   informally; WBC now 51 today (likely more reflective of myelofibrosis
   than infection given overall improvement in pt
s condition)
   - resumed hydroxyurea yesterday;  hold interferon
   - will email pt
s hematologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**] with an update
   .
   #  Chronic renal failure: at baseline, 1.1. UOP not great- wait for pt
   to autodiurese
   -  Avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Follow Cr
   .
   #  PAF with pacemaker:  stable, V-paced at this time.
   -  Appreciate EP help; demand pacing was increased to 90 on admission
   for shock, then decreased to 70 yesterday as pt doing better
   - Restart bbker today
   .
   #  CHF (EF of 45%): Repeat echo showing stable EF.
   -  hold lasix in the setting of normotension.
   .
   #  h/o HTN; now stable with SBP 110-130s.
   -  restart metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**] today (pt on toprol 25 mg Qday at
   home)
   -  Continue asa and simvastatin
   .
   #  PVD: decreased pulses in lower extremities
   -  Hold pentoxyfilline for now
   .
   #  Coagulopathy: INR near 2.  Patient received vitamin K.  INR now
   stable in mid-1
   .
   #  Elevated liver enzymes; stable transaminases, T.bili improved
   -  monitor LFTs
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH is elevated but Free T4 WNL. Likely sick
   euthyroid in the setting of acute illness.
   -  Continue home dose synthroid
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, Nutrition consult placed.
   Advance  diet as tolerated
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, HSQ, H2 blocker. PT consult placed.
   .
   # Access: 1 PIV, RIJ pulled yesterday, A line d/c
d this am.
   .
   # Code: full, confirmed with patient and his wife.
   .
   # Communication: family; HCP is wife [**Doctor First Name 96**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6184**])

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of myelofibrosis, recurrent C. diff, chronic renal failure, PAF with pacemaker, CHF, hypertension, PVD, coagulopathy, elevated liver enzymes, and hypothyroidism.
- The patient presented with septic shock and respiratory failure but has since resolved both conditions and was successfully extubated.
- The source of the septic shock remains unclear, but possible differentials include recurrent C. diff, ischemic bowel disease, or pneumonia. Microbiology studies have been negative so far.
- The patient has a high suspicion of C. diff infection, despite two negative tests, and will continue to receive empiric therapy for it. The antibiotic vancomycin will be given for at least 2 weeks after finishing ceftriaxone.
- The patient's elevated white count is likely related to steroid administration and myelofibrosis.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes show a troponin leak due to demand ischemia, but an echo showed no new areas of dysfunction.
- The patient's mental status has improved now that he is off all sedatives.
- The patient has idiopathic myelofibrosis, and his WBC count is now 51, which is likely more reflective of myelofibrosis than infection.
- The patient resumed hydroxyurea treatment and will continue it.
- The patient's chronic renal failure"
