   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - f/u on CT scan: Necrotic left kidney with ?abscess within the
   capsule. Urology consulted and thought maybe renal vein thrombosis
   occured first then kidney got infected. Got a MRI/MRA overnight: wet
   read does not show any vasculature abnormalities
   - Urology wants to ask hem/onc if screening for Factor V leiden would
   be beneficial since dad had some clotting disorder and she may be
   clotting some.
   - trend DIC labs; OK...not DIC, yet.
   - RUQ: no cholecystitis
   - cefepime/flagyl/vanc
   - spin urine: not done
   - central line- Not done...patient continued to be tachycardic and
   febrile.
   -  echo: 1+MR, normal EF and wall motion; High BNP
   - [**9-14**] labs from OSH: WBC 14.7, HCT 42.8, Plt 324, N85, Band1, L 6,
   M6, E2, Na 139 K 3.4, cl 105, HCO3 23, BUN 13, Cr 0.8, glu 109
   - Access has been an issue. PIV was not working, IV nurse able to put a
   20 guage in hand. Has one other that is not working that great, but
   kept in for emergency.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 37 year old female with acute sepsis secondary to
   pyelonephritis with evolving pancytopenia and radiological evidence of
   necrotic pyelonephritis
   .
   #. Sepsis: Secondary to pyelonephritis; CT showed severe pyelo on left
   with necrosis. Correlates with CVA tenderness on exam, however
   unimpressive urinalysis. Etiology unclear at this point, however
   possible leading diagnosis at this point is thrombosis or emboli to the
   kidney that may have occurred primarily and secondarily caused
   pyelonephritis. If it were emboli, unclear source at this point.
   MRI/MRA wet read not apparent for renal vein/artery thrombosis as
   potential cause. Patient continues to be tachycardic, spiking fevers,
   and concerning marked decrease in wbc. BP holding MAPS > 65.
   - Urology following as surgical intervention may be needed
   - f/u cultures
   - continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl for now until cultures speciate
   - Consider changing pain control from morphine to a dilaudid PCA
   - Monitor MAPs> 65
   - f/u CT/MRI
   #.Pancytopenia: Appears acute onset although as OSH labs [**9-14**] show wbc
   14.7, Hct 42.8, Plt 324 with 1 band. This picture may be a
   hemoconcentrated state, so not ideal but certainly markedly different
   than current picture. DIC labs show an elevated FDP, yet nml
   haptoglobin and fibrinogen. Difficult to interpret at this point.
   Patient with no active signs of bleeding. Ddx includes sepsis [**1-1**] acute
   pyelonephritis. Also more concerning is a ?hematological malignancy NOS
   causing severe marrow suppression.
   - trend DIC/ Hemolysis labs q12h; daily LFTs
   - - Hem/Onc does not feel this is DIC or TTP/HUS; likely [**1-1**] sepsis
   with marrow suppression; will ask them today if this presentation could
   be an atypical presentation of an underlying malignant process. Also,
   will discuss what our endpoints are regarding doing a bone marrow
   biopsy.
   - T+C
   - treat for pyelo as below, avoiding abx such as zosyn which may worsen
   throbocytopenia
   - Repeat peripheral smear without shistocytes
   - plt transfusion only if bleeding or plt < 10. pRBC transfusion for
   HCT < 21 or for dramatic acute drops
   .
   # Access: concerning as labs are very difficult to draw with
   peripherals. Patient needs a central line placed.
   - Attempt a Right IJ today. Unlikely to be a candidate for PICC as she
   is febrile
   - Will transfuse platelets during procedure today.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus to 140s. although overall average is trending
   downward. Likely combination of pain, fever, sepsis. Patient with
   pulmonary edema and small effusions and mild desaturation while laying
   flat in CT. Concern for too much volume resuscitation.
   - Careful with IVF hydration as patient appears volume up. Only bolus
   for a decrease in BP
   - Consider changing pain control from morphine to a dilaudid PCA to
   ensure adequate basal and breakthrough pain coverage
   - Fever control with tylenol
   .
   #. ARF: Cr 1.3 improved to 1.0, unclear baseline. [**1-1**] pyelo vs
   pre-renal/ATN from sepsis. Concerning as patient had marked dye load
   yesterday.
   - trend Cr; monitor UOP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - spin urine
   - treat for pyelo as above.
   - IVF
s prn for low MAPS

   #. Likely non-gap Metabolic acidosis: likely [**1-1**] aggressive NS
   repletion.
   - trend lytes

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis. She has evolving pancytopenia and radiological evidence of necrotic pyelonephritis. The patient's condition includes sepsis, pancytopenia, necrotic pyelonephritis, and potential complications such as renal vein thrombosis or emboli to the kidney. The patient requires surgical intervention, further cultures, continuation of antibiotics, and monitoring of vital signs and lab results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has acute sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not properly managed.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing a marked decrease in white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, anemia, and bleeding complications.
3. Necrotic Pyelonephritis: The patient has evidence of necrotic pyelonephritis, which can progress to abscess formation and potentially require surgical intervention.
4. Renal Vein Thrombosis: There is a concern for renal vein thrombosis, which can further complicate the patient's condition and potentially lead to renal infarction or loss of renal function.
5. Emboli to the Kidney: Another possibility is emboli to the kidney, which may"

   clinical improvement
   - Pain control with MSIV
   #.Thrombocytopenia/ amenia: Appears acute onset although currently we
   are without baseline CBC. Accompanied reported 10 pt HCT drop since
   friday suggestive of a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. No active
   signs of bleeding. Ddx includes sepsis [**1-1**] acute pyelonephritis
   complicated by DIC. elevated d-dimer suggestive of DIC however
   fibrinogen is elevated (may be falsely elevated [**1-1**] acute phase
   reaction). Alternatively may represent TTP/HUS, especially with
   elevated Cr.
   - trend DIC/ Hemolysis labs q6h
   - T+C
   - await heme recs, especially ? anticoagulation
   - treat for pyelo as below, avoiding abx such as zosyn which may worsen
   throbocytopenia
   - trend LFTs
   - avoid PPI as may worsen plt
   - f/u blood smear
   - get baseline CBC from friday
   - plt transfusion only if bleeding or plt < 10. pRBC transfusion for
   HCT < 21 or for dramatic acute drops
   .
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus to 140s. Ddx acute blood loss vs PE in setting of
   DIC. PE possible given new poor R wave progression on EKG indicative of
   R heart strain.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - hold on CTA given ARF
   - hold on emperic treatment for PE given thrombocytopenia
   .
   #. ARF: Cr 1.3, unclear baseline. [**1-1**] pyelo vs end organ damage [**1-1**]
   TTP/HUS or DIC.
   - trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - spin urine
   - treat for pyelo as above.

   # abd pain: Evolving to more diffuse pain, most tender on RUQ. Some
   maybe referred from abd pain. RUQ may represented evolving hepatitis or
   clot formation in setting of DIC

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with acute onset thrombocytopenia and radiologic evidence of necrotic pyelonephritis. The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. Pyelonephritis: This condition can lead to sepsis, which may result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient already shows signs of systemic inflammation, such as elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels.

2. Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The acute onset of thrombocytopenia along with a reported 10-point drop in hemoglobin suggests the possibility of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. This condition can be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Monitoring of DIC/hemolysis labs every 6 hours is necessary.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, ranging from 126 to 151 beats per minute. This could be due to acute blood loss or pulmonary embolism (PE). Given the presence of DIC, PE is a possibility, especially with new poor R wave progression on EKG indicative of right heart strain.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 37 year old female with acute sepsis secondary to
   pyelonephritis with evolving pancytopenia and radiological evidence of
   necrotic pyelonephritis
   .
   #. Sepsis: Secondary to pyelonephritis; CT showed severe pyelo on left
   with necrosis, now likely super infected but as yet unable to speciate
   an organism.  Abdominal exam is improved today, but continues to spike
   fevers, likely related to continued source of infection, so she will
   require a prolonged antibiotic course.
   - tachycardia improved with treatment of infection
   - Urology following as surgical intervention may be needed, but none
   acutely
   - f/u cultures
   - continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl for now, will likely need an empiric
   14 day course, today is day [**1-13**]
   - Pain control with MS contin 30mg and then prn IV morphine, will space
   out prn dose to q6h:prn
   .
   #.Pancytopenia: Appears acute onset although as OSH labs [**9-14**] show wbc
   14.7, Hct 42.8, Plt 324 with 1 band.  DIC labs show an elevated FDP,
   yet normal haptoglobin and fibrinogen, and mildly elevated coags, all
   of which have remained stable.  No need to further trend DIC labs since
   her labs have been stable, will readdress with any changes in
   hemodynamic status.
   - Hem/Onc does not feel this is DIC or TTP/HUS; likely [**1-1**] sepsis with
   marrow suppression; and counts have now stabilized and are trending up
   .
   # Access: right IJ placed yesterday for better access, would like to
   transition patient to a PICC since she will need at least 14 days of
   antibiotics, will discuss with IV team since patient continues to be
   febrile and may continue to be febrile as the source of her infection
   (necrotic kidney) is still in place.  Will f/u blood cultures and
   attempt placement with 48hours of negative cx
   # Tachycardia: significantly improving with treatment of infection, HR
   down to the 110
s today.  HR increases with periods of fever and pain
   overall improved.
   - No further IVF for now unless patient becomes hypotensive as she is
   volume overloaded with bilateral pleural effusions
   - continue pain control with MS contin and PRN morphine, will spread
   out pain regimen
   .
   #. ARF: Cr stable at 1.0, currently with only one functional kidney so
   will avoid all nephrotoxins and monitor urine output, which has
   recently increased likely due to autodiuresis.
   - treat for pyelo as above.
   - renal consulted for help with etiology of necrotic left kidney
   .
   #. Likely non-gap Metabolic acidosis: likely [**1-1**] aggressive NS
   repletion.
   - LR if she needs IVF
   .
   #. GERD: hold PPI for now given ability to decrease plt
   - Ranitidine [**Hospital1 7**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 37-year-old female with acute sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis.
- She has pancytopenia and radiological evidence of necrotic pyelonephritis.
- She is febrile, tachycardic, and has bilateral pleural effusions.
- The patient has a central venous access line in the right internal jugular vein.
- She is on prolonged antibiotic therapy due to a likely super-infected necrotic kidney.
- Pain control is being managed with MS contin and IV morphine.
- The patient's hemodynamic status is improving, but she remains febrile.
- There are concerns about access, pancytopenia, tachycardia, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and GERD.
- The patient is being advanced to a regular diet and prophylaxis measures are in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is secondary to pyelonephritis, which has resulted in necrosis of the left kidney. She will require a prolonged antibiotic course to treat the infection.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and low platelet count. This could be due to sepsis with marrow suppression or other causes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thromboc"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 37 year old female with acute sepsis secondary to
   pyelonephritis with evolving pancytopenia and radiological evidence of
   necrotic pyelonephritis
   .
   #. Sepsis: Secondary to pyelonephritis; CT showed severe pyelo on left
   with necrosis. Correlates with CVA tenderness on exam, however
   unimpressive urinalysis. Etiology unclear at this point, however
   possible leading diagnosis at this point is thrombosis or emboli to the
   kidney that may have occurred primarily and secondarily caused
   pyelonephritis. If it were emboli, unclear source at this point.
   MRI/MRA wet read not apparent for renal vein/artery thrombosis as
   potential cause. Patient continues to be tachycardic, spiking fevers,
   and concerning marked decrease in wbc. BP holding MAPS > 65.
   - Urology following as surgical intervention may be needed
   - f/u cultures
   - continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl for now until cultures speciate
   - Consider changing pain control from morphine to a dilaudid PCA
   - Monitor MAPs> 65
   - f/u CT/MRI
   #.Pancytopenia: Appears acute onset although as OSH labs [**9-14**] show wbc
   14.7, Hct 42.8, Plt 324 with 1 band. This picture may be a
   hemoconcentrated state, so not ideal but certainly markedly different
   than current picture. DIC labs show an elevated FDP, yet nml
   haptoglobin and fibrinogen. Difficult to interpret at this point.
   Patient with no active signs of bleeding. Ddx includes sepsis [**1-1**] acute
   pyelonephritis. Also more concerning is a ?hematological malignancy NOS
   causing severe marrow suppression.
   - trend DIC/ Hemolysis labs q12h; daily LFTs
   - - Hem/Onc does not feel this is DIC or TTP/HUS; likely [**1-1**] sepsis
   with marrow suppression; will ask them today if this presentation could
   be an atypical presentation of an underlying malignant process. Also,
   will discuss what our endpoints are regarding doing a bone marrow
   biopsy.
   - T+C
   - treat for pyelo as below, avoiding abx such as zosyn which may worsen
   throbocytopenia
   - Repeat peripheral smear without shistocytes
   - plt transfusion only if bleeding or plt < 10. pRBC transfusion for
   HCT < 21 or for dramatic acute drops
   .
   # Access: concerning as labs are very difficult to draw with
   peripherals. Patient needs a central line placed.
   - Attempt a Right IJ today. Unlikely to be a candidate for PICC as she
   is febrile
   - Will transfuse platelets during procedure today.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus to 140s. although overall average is trending
   downward. Likely combination of pain, fever, sepsis. Patient with
   pulmonary edema and small effusions and mild desaturation while laying
   flat in CT. Concern for too much volume resuscitation.
   - Careful with IVF hydration as patient appears volume up. Only bolus
   for a decrease in BP
   - Consider changing pain control from morphine to a dilaudid PCA to
   ensure adequate basal and breakthrough pain coverage
   - Fever control with tylenol
   .
   #. ARF: Cr 1.3 improved to 1.0, unclear baseline. [**1-1**] pyelo vs
   pre-renal/ATN from sepsis. Concerning as patient had marked dye load
   yesterday.
   - trend Cr; monitor UOP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - spin urine
   - treat for pyelo as above.
   - IVF
s prn for low MAPS

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis. This condition needs to be closely monitored and treated with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has developed pancytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of this condition.

3. Necrotic pyelonephritis: The patient has radiological evidence of necrotic pyelonephritis, indicating kidney damage. Surgical intervention may be required, as discussed with the urology team.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to pain, fever, and sepsis. Close monitoring of the heart rate and blood pressure is necessary.

5. Central venous access line complications: The patient has a newly introduced central venous access line that may pose potential complications such as infection or thrombosis. Regular monitoring and assessment of the line are essential.

6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema and small effusions, which may progress to ARDS if not managed appropriately. Careful fluid management and oxygenation strategies should be implemented.

7. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creat"

   Assessment and Plan
    37 year old female with acute sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis with
   evolving pancytopenia and radiological evidence of necrotic
   pyelonephritis
   .
   #. Sepsis: Secondary to pyelonephritis; CT showed severe pyelo on left
   with necrosis, now likely super infected but as yet unable to speciate
   an organism.  Abdominal exam is improved today, but continues to spike
   fevers, likely related to continued source of infection, so she will
   require a prolonged antibiotic course.
   - Urology following as surgical intervention may be needed, but none
   acutely
   - Concern for family h/o
   - f/u cultures
   - continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl for now, will likely need an empiric
   14 day course, today is day [**2-10**]
   - Pain control morphine PCA as pain was not controlled on Morphine 2 mg
   q 3 hours and patient was too sedated on MS Contin 30 mg q 12 hours
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Peaked to the 140s yesterday in setting of pain,
   fever, and sepsis. Continues to be in sinus tachycardia although
   improved
   - No further IVF for now unless patient becomes hypotensive as she is
   volume overloaded with bilateral pleural effusions
   - continue pain control with Morphine PCA and titrate to patient
   comfort
   .
   #.Pancytopenia: Appears acute onset although as OSH labs [**9-14**] show wbc
   14.7, Hct 42.8, Plt 324 with 1 band.  DIC labs show an elevated FDP,
   yet normal haptoglobin and fibrinogen, and mildly elevated coags, all
   of which have remained stable.  No need to further trend DIC labs since
   her labs have been stable, will readdress with any changes in
   hemodynamic status.
   - Hem/Onc does not feel this is DIC or TTP/HUS; likely [**1-1**] sepsis with
   marrow suppression; and counts have now stabilized and are trending up
   .
   # Access: right IJ placed yesterday for better access, would like to
   transition patient to a PICC since she will need at least 14 days of
   antibiotics, will discuss with IV team since patient continues to be
   febrile and may continue to be febrile as the source of her infection
   (necrotic kidney) is still in place.  Will f/u blood cultures and
   attempt placement with 48hours of negative cx
   .
   #. ARF: Cr stable at 1.0, currently with only one functional kidney so
   will avoid all nephrotoxins and monitor urine output, which has
   recently increased likely due to autodiuresis.
   - treat for pyelo as above.
   - renal consulted for help with etiology of necrotic left kidney
   .
   #. Likely non-gap Metabolic acidosis: likely [**1-1**] aggressive NS
   repletion.
   - LR if she needs IVF
   .
   #. GERD: hold PPI for now given ability to decrease plt
   - Ranitidine [**Hospital1 7**]

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with acute sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis, evolving pancytopenia, and radiological evidence of necrotic pyelonephritis. The patient's condition remains critical, and several medical complications can arise.

1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing ongoing fevers and has a severe infection in the left kidney with necrosis. This infection may require prolonged antibiotic treatment.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient is showing signs of low white blood cell count, low red blood cell count, and low platelet count. This could be due to sepsis-induced bone marrow suppression.

3. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated, which may be a response to pain, fever, and sepsis. It is important to monitor and manage this to prevent further complications.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury with a stable creatinine level of 1.0. It is crucial to avoid nephrotoxins and closely monitor urine output.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient's platelet count is currently low, prophylaxis for DVT should be considered, especially if the platelet count increases.

6. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness. An H2 blocker should be continued to prevent gastric ulcers"

   - Urology following as surgical intervention may be needed, but none
   acutely
   - Concern for family h/o clotting; given her father has a h/o Factor V

   Assessment and Plan
    37 year old female with acute sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis with
   evolving pancytopenia and radiological evidence of necrotic
   pyelonephritis
   .
   #. Sepsis: Secondary to pyelonephritis; CT showed severe pyelo on left
   with necrosis, now likely super infected but as yet unable to speciate
   an organism.  Abdominal exam is improved today, but continues to spike
   fevers, likely related to continued source of infection, so she will
   require a prolonged antibiotic course.
   - Urology following as surgical intervention may be needed, but none
   acutely
   - f/u cultures
   - continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl for now, will likely need an empiric
   14 day course, today is day [**2-10**]
   - Pain control morphine PCA as pain was not controlled on Morphine 2 mg
   q 3 hours and patient was too sedated on MS Contin 30 mg q 12 hours
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Peaked to the 140s yesterday in setting of pain,
   fever, and sepsis. Continues to be in sinus tachycardia although
   improved
   - No further IVF for now unless patient becomes hypotensive as she is
   volume overloaded with bilateral pleural effusions
   - continue pain control with Morphine PCA and titrate to patient
   comfort
   .
   #.Pancytopenia: Appears acute onset although as OSH labs [**9-14**] show wbc
   14.7, Hct 42.8, Plt 324 with 1 band.  DIC labs show an elevated FDP,
   yet normal haptoglobin and fibrinogen, and mildly elevated coags, all
   of which have remained stable.  No need to further trend DIC labs since
   her labs have been stable, will readdress with any changes in
   hemodynamic status.
   - Hem/Onc does not feel this is DIC or TTP/HUS; likely [**1-1**] sepsis with
   marrow suppression; and counts have now stabilized and are trending up
   .
   # Access: right IJ placed yesterday for better access, would like to
   transition patient to a PICC since she will need at least 14 days of
   antibiotics, will discuss with IV team since patient continues to be
   febrile and may continue to be febrile as the source of her infection
   (necrotic kidney) is still in place.  Will f/u blood cultures and
   attempt placement with 48hours of negative cx
   .
   #. ARF: Cr stable at 1.0, currently with only one functional kidney so
   will avoid all nephrotoxins and monitor urine output, which has
   recently increased likely due to autodiuresis.
   - treat for pyelo as above.
   - renal consulted for help with etiology of necrotic left kidney
   .
   #. Likely non-gap Metabolic acidosis: likely [**1-1**] aggressive NS
   repletion.
   - LR if she needs IVF
   .
   #. GERD: hold PPI for now given ability to decrease plt
   - Ranitidine [**Hospital1 7**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with acute sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis. The patient has evolving pancytopenia and radiological evidence of necrotic pyelonephritis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing fevers and a severe infection in the left kidney, which may continue to be a source of infection. Prolonged antibiotic course will likely be needed to treat the sepsis.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count. This could be due to sepsis with marrow suppression or other causes. Close monitoring of blood counts is necessary.

3. Abdominal pain and tenderness: The patient has pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and left lower quadrant (LLQ). This could indicate an ongoing infection or other abdominal pathology.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, ranging from 114 to 130 beats per minute. This could be due to sepsis, fever, pain, or other underlying conditions.

5. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, indicating fluid accumulation in the lungs. This may affect breathing and oxygenation.

6. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has stable creatinine levels at 1"
