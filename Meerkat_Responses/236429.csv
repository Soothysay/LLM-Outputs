","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of pulmonary aspergillosis, mycobacterium abscessus, and mild dementia. She was initially admitted to the ICU with symptoms of increased cough, high oxygenation therapy (HoTN), nausea, and vomiting. The initial CT scan showed possible obstructing gallbladder stone with a dilated gallbladder. The patient was started on antibiotics due to her allergies. A HIDA scan was recommended for further evaluation of possible cholangitis. She is currently hemodynamically stable and afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholelithiasis with possible cholangitis: The patient's symptoms and the presence of a dilated gallbladder on the CT scan suggest the possibility of cholangitis. This condition can lead to infection, inflammation, and obstruction of the bile ducts.
2. Pulmonary aspergillosis: The patient has a history of this condition, which can cause respiratory symptoms and complications such as pneumonia.
3. Dehydration: The patient's history of vomiting and the low blood pressure may indicate dehydration. This can lead to decreased organ perfusion and function.
4. Infection: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, cough, and elevated white blood cell count, suggest the possibility of an evolving infection. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be related to the gastrointestinal or respiratory system.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient"

","Summary:
An 80-year-old female with a history of pulmonary aspergillosis and mycobacterium abscessus presents with symptoms of increased cough, hoarseness, nausea, and vomiting. She was initially sent to the emergency department from the clinic for these symptoms. In the ED, she was afebrile with blood pressure in the 90s and oxygen saturation of 92%. A CT scan showed possible obstructing gallbladder stone with dilated gallbladder. She was started on linezolid, zosyn, and clinda due to her allergies. She was seen by surgery and a HIDA scan was recommended for further evaluation of possible cholangitis. In the MICU, she is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Her current issues include cholelithiasis with possible cholangitis and pulmonary aspergillosis.

24-hour events:
- The patient received linezolid and piperacillin infusions.
- She was given various medications for ICU care, including mucomyst, tylenol, albuterol, atorvastatin, benzonatate, fentanyl patch, guaifenesin, heparin sodium, keppra, levothyroxine, omeprazole, phenytoin, spiriva, and voriconazole.
- The patient's vital signs were monitored, with temperatures ranging from 36.1 to 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 85 and 94 beats per minute, blood pressure between 90/39 and 90/50 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10 and 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- Fluid balance showed an intake of 1215 mL and output of 790 mL.
- Blood products were not administered.
- Urine output was 390 mL.
- The patient was on nasal cannula for oxygen delivery.
- ABG results were not provided.
- Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right upper lobe, expiratory coarse rhonchi diffusely, and difficulty cooperating with the exam.
- Neurologic examination was not assessed.
- Lab results indicated elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low sodium, low potassium, elevated chloride, elevated bicarbonate, and elevated blood glucose levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient is improving after receiving IV fluids, likely due to evolving infection and dehydration. She will continue to receive IV fluids to maintain systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg and random cortisol levels will be checked given prednisone use.
2. Infection, possibly from the gastrointestinal tract or pulmonary system, is suspected. Zosyn and linezolid will be continued, clinda will be discontinued, and further evaluation with a HIDA scan and chest CT will be done to assess for pulmonary process. ID service consultation will be pursued.
3. The patient's pulmonary aspergillosis will be managed with continued voriconazole.
4. Fluid responsiveness and improving creatinine after IVF indicate the need for further evaluation of urine electrolytes and maintaining urine output above 30 mL/hr.
5. Pain management will be addressed by consulting with the primary care physician regarding an adequate pain regimen and continuing fentanyl patch at 25 mcg and lidoderm patch on the back.
6. Hypothyroidism will be managed with levothyroxine.
7. Hyperlipidemia will be addressed with statin therapy.
8. Antihypertensive medications will be held.
9. The patient will be NPO until a decision is made regarding a surgical procedure.
10. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. Restraints will be reviewed as needed.

Disposition:
The patient will remain in the ICU for now until a surgical procedure is ruled out. Total time spent with the patient is 45 minutes."

","The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. The patient's recent history includes a nuclear medicine scan showing no filling of the gallbladder, suggesting no active cholecystitis. However, the patient is still receiving antibiotics and may require a percutaneous drain if necessary.

The patient's chest CT reveals multifocal post-obstructive pneumonia, and the stent is no longer in place. The patient's symptoms have improved with nebulizers and deep suctioning. There is also a mention of an attempted arterial blood gas (ABG) but was unsuccessful due to the patient's discomfort. The patient's blood pressure has fluctuated and normalized without treatment.

The patient's family's code status is uncertain, and consent for bronchoscopy is pending. The patient has allergies to quinolones, vancomycin analogues, and levofloxacin. The patient has received antibiotics including linezolid and piperacillin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 129 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 121/62 to 125/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,810 mL and output of 1,215 mL. The patient's blood products and urine output are within normal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old lady with multiple pulmonary insults and a history of cholecystitis. She has been admitted to the ICU with borderline hypotension. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains in the 90s-100s, close to her apparent baseline. Possible causes include iatrogenic blood pressure medications, hypovolemia from hypotension, sepsis from pulmonary or gastrointestinal source (unlikely given CXR, normal WBC count, benign abdominal exam). 

2. Nausea/CCY: The patient has a stone and possible distended bladder neck on ultrasound and CT. She has no abdominal tenderness and no doctor's sign, but has been vomiting for three days. Differential includes biliary colic, gastroenteritis with incidental finding and early cholecystitis. Elevated Alk Phos may be from fungal infection, anti-fungals, or from CCY.

3. Multiple pulmonary infections: The patient has an ongoing treatment with ID for pulmonary Aspergillosis & M. abscessus with a recent H. Flu PNA. She has a continued cough, worse the last three days. 

4. Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine is elevated from 0.9 to 2.0, likely pre-renal from poor PO intake, but ATN possible. No obstruction noted.

   #. Hypotension: The patient's BP, once receiving 2L NS in the ED has
   remained in the 90s-100s, close to her apparent baseline.  She is on
   Lisinopril, Atenolol and multiple narcotics at her nursing home and
   presumable received them today.  Possible causes include Iatrogenic BP
   Meds, Hypovolemia from hypotension, Sepsis from Pulmonary or GI source
   (unlikely given CXR, normal WBC count, benign abdominal exam).  The
   patient also has poor peripheral access.
   - Monitor UOP goal 30mL/hr
   - Goal SBP >= 90
   - Fluid bolus PRN given likely hypotension
   - Continue Linezolid, Zosyn, Voriconazle for Pulm/GI source
   - Minimize Narcotics, hold Lisinopril/Atenolol, Lasix
   .
   #. Nausea/?CCY: The patient has a stone and possible distended bladder
   neck on U/S & CT.  She has no abdominal tenderness and no [**Doctor Last Name 1850**]
   sign, but has been vomiting x3 days.  Differential includes biliary
   colic, gastroenteritis with incidental finding and early
   cholecystisits.  Elevated Alk Phos non-specific, may be from fungal
   infection, anti-fungals or from CCY.

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, FUNGAL
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   An 80 year old lady with multiple pulmonary insults, Fungal PNA
   admitted to the ICU with borderline hypotension in the setting of ?
   cholecystitis.
   .
   #. Hypotension: BP stable with repeated fluid bolus.  Etiology possibly
   sepsis from lung source, less likely GI.  Likely also hypovolemic on
   admission.
   - Monitor UOP goal 30mL/hr
   - Goal SBP >= 90
   - Fluid bolus PRN given likely hypotension
   - Continue Linezolid, Zosyn, Voriconazle for potential pulmonary source
   - Minimize Narcotics, hold Lisinopril/Atenolol, Lasix
   .
   #. Nausea and possibility of cholecystitis:  Nausea resolved, pain
   free. no clinical e/o cholecystitis, no pericholecystic fluid or other
   radiographic features of cholecystitis.
   - conservative managment
   .
   #. Multiple Pulmonary Infections: The patient has an ongoing treatment
   with ID for Pulmonary Aspergillosis & M. abscessus with a recent H. Flu
   PNA.  She has a continued cough, worse the last three days.   History
   of prior IP interventions s/p stent placement and removal.
   - Appreciate ID Input
   - Continue Voriconazole\
   - f/u IP regarding thoracentesis and broncoscopy today which they are
   planning on.
   - Nebs
   - Cough suppresion with Guaifenisin &  Benzonatate
   .
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: resolved, likely prerenal
   -
   - Fluid hydration as above
   - Hold Lasix, Lisinopril
   .
   #. COPD: Not likely an exacerbation, treat underlying infections as
   above.
   - Tiotropium
   - Nebs
   - No indication for steroids at this time
   .
   #. Anti-Epileptic Use:  Cannot find history of epilepsy, seizures or
   brain mets currently.
   - Continue current doses of Keppra & Dilantin, check levels in AM
   .
   #. Prednisone Use: unsure why patient is on prednisone
   - Random Cortisol in AM
   .
   #. Chronic Pain: Unclear why, but the patient is on Fentanyl, Lidoderm,
   Oxycodone, Tramadol, Ibuprofen and Tylenol.
   - Obtain outside records
   - Continue Lidoderm, Tylenol only

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old lady admitted to the ICU with multiple pulmonary insults, including fungal pneumonia. She also has a history of cholecystitis but currently shows no clinical evidence of it. The patient's hypotension is stable with repeated fluid bolus and is possibly due to sepsis from a lung source or hypovolemia. The patient has ongoing treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis, M. abscessus, and H. flu pneumonia. She has cognitive deficits and a cough that is worsening. The patient has resolved acute kidney injury and COPD, which is not likely an exacerbation. She is also being treated for conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, constipation, and chronic pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is possibly due to sepsis from a lung source. If not properly managed, this could lead to further complications and deterioration of the patient's condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's baseline oxygen saturation is 96%, and she has multifocal post-obstructive pneumonia. If her respiratory status worsens, she may require mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
3. Renal dysfunction: Although the patient's acute kidney injury has resolved, ongoing hypotension and sepsis could potentially lead to renal dysfunction again.
4. Infection recurrence: The patient has multiple ongoing pulmonary infections. If these infections are"
