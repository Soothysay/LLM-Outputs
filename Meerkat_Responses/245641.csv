   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with history of pharyngeal cancer now admit to [**Hospital1 3356**] with desquamating rash following Ibuprofen use.  His hospital
   course there was complicated by renal failure, hepatitis and
   progression of rash to desquamation.  He, in the setting of some
   significant pain medications had worsening respiratory status and then
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure had intubation with significant
   secretions and is transferred to ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and sepsis.
   1)Respiratory Failure
This is impressive and signigicant hypoxemic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure at this time.  On exam
patient has
   significant ongoing inspiratory effort and ventilator dys-syncrhony.
   In this setting he retains some very real expiratory flow limitation
   limiting total respiratory rate than can be safely delivered.
   Oxygenation compromise may well be related to effusions and multi-focal
   infiltrates.
   -Move to PCV at 30/10 with Ti=0.8 given exam during rounds
   -Repeat ABG
   -Will pursue ECHO to evaluate potential contribution from cardiogenic
   insult (Enzymes have been negative to date)
   -Vanco/Zosyn for pneumonia
   -[**Month (only) 11**] need to increase sedation in the setting but will work to optimize
   ventilator support
   -Esophageal balloon given severe hypoxemia, hemodynamic compromise with
   increased PEEP and need to establish truly effective ventilation and
   oxygenation support
   -Wil Keep PEEP at 10 for now given compromise
   -Continue with bronchodilators
   2)Sepsis-Likely pulmonary source, patient with significant and
   persistent compromise
   -Levophed 0.3 to continue
   -Will use pressors and CVP to guide intervention
   -Has CvO2=70 at this time
   -Will need continued support
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Likely ATN
   -Will need to continue to support with adequate urine output and
   creatinine
   4)TEN-
   -Pred 20mg/d
   -Continue with slow taper
   -Will consult dermatology for input on consideration of soruces and
   link to systemic insult

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of pharyngeal cancer, admitted to the hospital with a desquamating rash following Ibuprofen use. He had a complicated hospital course with renal failure, hepatitis, and progression of rash to desquamation. The patient then developed worsening respiratory status and hypoxemic respiratory failure, leading to intubation. He was transferred to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure and sepsis.

The patient is currently experiencing significant hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has ongoing inspiratory effort and ventilator dys-synchrony. Oxygenation compromise may be related to effusions and multi-focal infiltrates. The plan includes moving to PCV at 30/10 with Ti=0.8, repeating ABG, pursuing ECHO to evaluate potential contribution from cardiogenic insult, and providing sedation and bronchodilators as needed.

The patient also has sepsis with a likely pulmonary source, persistent compromise, and requires continued support with pressors and CVP. Acute renal failure is suspected and will need to be supported with adequate urine output and creatinine monitoring. The patient is being treated for TEN with Prednisone and will consult dermatology for further input.

ICU care includes nutrition through tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing significant hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Complications may include further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, increased secretions, and potential need for tracheostomy.
2) Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with a likely pulmonary source. Complications may include organ dysfunction, systemic inflammatory response, and potential septic shock.
3) Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute renal failure, likely due to ATN. Complications may include worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
4) TEN (Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis): The patient is being treated for TEN, which is a severe skin condition. Complications may include progression of skin involvement, secondary infections, and systemic involvement.
5) Pneumonia: The patient has multi-focal infiltrates and is being treated for pneumonia. Complications may include worsening lung function, respiratory distress, and potential need for bronchoscopy.
6) Cardiogenic Insult: The patient's ECHO will be done to evaluate potential contribution from cardiogenic insult. Complications may include heart failure and reduced cardiac output.
7) DVT/PE: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and underlying comorbidities."

   Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   - continued on levophed and vasopressin (as of midnight, check in AM)
   - multiple vent setting changes made without improvement.  Acidosis
   primarily secondary to septic shock.  Look at long list of ABGs!
   - had family meeting
   - derm consult: pathology at outside hospital showed LCV.  This may be
   resolving LCV secondary to NSAIDS or infection.  The rash does not
   appear to be an active process and there is no evidence of systemic
   vasculitis.  Therefore, reasonable to discontinue steroids.  It is also
   possible that pts rash is a hypersensitivity reaction.
   - nutrition consult: TF recommended
   - continued on flagyl/cipro.  Added ceftriaxone (one dose) to cover
   possible disseminated strep pneumo infection.  Discuss in rounds
   whether to continue.
   - OSH CT Scan: patchy left lower love and smaller right upper lobe
   infiltrates.  Small to medium sized bilateral pleural effusions with
   associated bibasilar atelectasis and consolidation.
   - abdominal u/s: 1. The aorta is not of normal caliber throughout.
   2. The kidneys are slightly decreased in size with slightly atrophic

   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Likely in ARDS [**12-21**] underlying HAP or
   aspiration.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history
   puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less likely given no
   blood seen on bronch, stable HCT.
   - will wean PEEP and repeat ABG
   - continue Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro for HAP for now
   - d/c Ceftriaxone that was added yesterday bc concern for S pneumo
   (however now less likely as OSH BAL showed GBS)
   - f/u sputum, blood cultures
   - f/u ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on Levophed and vasopression.
   -continue to wean off pressors as tolerated
   - monitor UOP, SBPs
   -f/u cultures
   -hold metoprolol and lasix
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances:
   - pt has an AG of 11 (given low albumin, has an elev AG) that is likely
   [**12-21**] to uremia (lactate is nl, not diabetic)
   - pt also has a non-anion gap acidosis (given delta-delta calculation),
   likely [**12-21**] IVF with NS (no diarrhea, RTA also on diff)
   - pt also has respiratory acidosis (elev pCO2 on ABG) due to current
   respiratory failure
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis
   -wound care consult (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   -d/c steroids per derm
   -f/u any new derm recs
   -no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure: Cr up to 2.6 from 2.3. Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.  Also, could be prerenal from hypotension,
   dehydration.
   -renally dose medications
   -FeNa is 1.25% indicating instrinsic>prerenal etiology
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged acidemia.
   Currently, sedated, unresponsive to voice or pain.
   -consider window from sedation to assess neuro status more accurately
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during diuresis.
   -check PM lytes
   - consider free water flushes if Na continues to be elev
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: patient in sinus here, holding metoprolol given
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism:
   -continue 37.5 mcg IV levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was improving until Saturday when his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. The patient was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), ruling out cardiogenic shock. The patient's smoking history puts him at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The plan is to wean PEEP and repeat arterial blood gas (ABG).

2. Hypotension: The patient likely has sepsis from an underlying lung infection. He is currently on levophed and vasopressin. The plan is to continue to wean off pressors as tolerated, monitor urine output (UOP) and systolic blood pressures (SBPs), and follow up with cultures.

3. Acid/Base Disturbances: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis (AG of 11) that is likely due to uremia (normal lactate levels, not diabetic)."

   Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   - continued on levophed and vasopressin (as of midnight, check in AM)
   - multiple vent setting changes made without improvement.  Acidosis
   primarily secondary to septic shock.  Look at long list of ABGs!
   - had family meeting
   - derm consult: pathology at outside hospital showed LCV.  This may be
   resolving LCV secondary to NSAIDS or infection.  The rash does not
   appear to be an active process and there is no evidence of systemic
   vasculitis.  Therefore, reasonable to discontinue steroids.  It is also
   possible that pts rash is a hypersensitivity reaction.
   - nutrition consult: TF recommended
   - continued on flagyl/cipro.  Added ceftriaxone (one dose) to cover
   possible disseminated strep pneumo infection.  Discuss in rounds
   whether to continue.
   - OSH CT Scan: patchy left lower love and smaller right upper lobe
   infiltrates.  Small to medium sized bilateral pleural effusions with
   associated bibasilar atelectasis and consolidation.
   - abdominal u/s: 1. The aorta is not of normal caliber throughout.
   2. The kidneys are slightly decreased in size with slightly atrophic
   parenchyma with no focal masses or abnormalities. 3. Small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid is seen. 4. One gallstone in the gallbladder with

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology.  Given AMS, family report of
   poor difficulty swallowing, and acute change in CXR, aspiration is
   possible.  HAP and CHF/Volume overload also possible particularly given
   his hyperdynamic EF (reportedly 75%) and volume rescusciation given his
   desquamation.  Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.
   Vasculitis in lungs less likely given no blood seen on bronch, stable
   HCT.
   - AC with FI02 tonight, consider weaning tomorrow
   - possible bronch in the AM
   - Vanco/Zosyn for HAP
   - Sputum culture
   - ECHO in the AM
   - continue prednisone taper and nebs for ? COPD
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - repeat ABG in AM
   - check ANCA
   - may need chest CT if no clear etiology determined.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Could be related to intubation, sedation as occurred
   peri-intubation.  However, infection/sepsis is also a possibility given
   his clinical picture.  Also, patient recently diuresed so hypovolemia
   possibly contributing (though CVP not transducing).  Lactic acidosis
   considered, but lactate normal.
   -d/c dopamine as patient recently in afib with RVR
   -levophed to keep MAP >60
   -CVP not [**Location (un) 103**], Vigileo for fluid status
   -good UOP, got IVF tonight.
   -continue steroid taper
   -blood cultures, urine cultures, urine legionella antigen
   -hold metoprolol and hold lasix
   .
   #) Rash: Unclear etiology.  Leukoclastic vasculitis most commonly
   associated with medication effect but patient only noted to take 2
   advil.  No toxin exposures.  Could be paraneoplastic phenomenon given
   h/o throat cancer and recent weight loss, poor PO and dysphagia.
   -wound care consult (were using eucerin cream at OSH)
   -supportive care for now.
   -on prednisone taper
   -no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure: Likely related to desquamation/rash and dehydration.
   Creatinine trending down and close to baseline (though up from 1.4 on
   Saturday).  Less likely to be pulmonary-renal syndrome given
   improvement in renal and worsening in pulm status
   -renally dose medications.
   -repeat creatinine in AM, if worsening would check urine lytes
   -u/a with culture
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Patient's MS initially improving and then
   declined with decline in respiratory status.  Patient at high risk for
   delerium given underlying dementia, and then received multiple doses of
   haldol, some ativan and ?ambien.  Less likely ETOH withdrawl given pt.
   drinks 2 beers/[**Last Name (un) **], but this is possible.
   -f/cu CT head from OSH
   -give thiamine.
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during diuresis.
   -fluids tonight, recheck lytes in AM.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) afib with RVR: patient in sinus here, holding metoprolol given
   hupotension.
   .
   #) hypothyroidism: Patient on 75mcg PO
   -37.5 mcg IV levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. The patient's respiratory failure could be due to aspiration, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or congestive heart failure (CHF)/volume overload. The hypotension may be related to intubation, sedation, infection/sepsis, or hypovolemia. The rash could be caused by leukoclastic vasculitis, medication effect, or a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Renal failure is likely related to dehydration and desquamation. The altered mental status may be due to delirium, ethanol withdrawal, or medication side effects.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to aspiration, HAP, or CHF/volume overload. Possible interventions include AC with FiO2, bronchoscopy, and chest CT.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to intubation, sedation, infection/sepsis, or hypovolemia. Possible interventions include discontinuing dopamine, levophed to maintain MAP >60, and Vigileo for fluid status.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with initial admission with rash and now with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure complicated by sepsis.  His initial insult for the
   respiratory failure may well be an aspiration event in the setting of
   delirium, may well simply be hospital acquired pneumonia or alternative
   source of sepsis driving current picture of ARDS.  He has been able to
   maintain improvement in oxygenation and stability of pressor
   requirements across past 24 hours.  What is of concern is evolution of
   renal failure and persistent gap and non-gap acidosis with pH decreased
   signficantly
   1)Respiratory Failure/ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE
   LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 2**])-
   Hypoxemia
we have PEEP=18 and FIO2=0.5 through to this morning, with
   decreased of PEEP to 14 and maintenance of same driving pressure do
   have an increase in Vt to 480 from 450cc this morning suggesting modest
   overdistention at previous PEEP.  Will decrease to 14 and FIO2=50 and
   re-evaluate ABG
   Pneumonia
Patient with significant pulmonary infiltrate and likely
   hospital acquired pneumonia with broad coverage in effect and will
   continue with Vanco and 2 antibiotic therapy for possible gram negative
   organisms
Vanco/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone/Cipro/Flagyl
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
This is present but quite mild
if we
   can better effect ventilation with improved PEEP titration we may see
   decrease in CO2 at next ABG.  Will tolerate pH at 7.2 or greater given
   multiple competing issues.
   2)Sepsis
   -Vanco/CTX/Cefepime/Cipro/Flagyl to continue
   -Will wean Levophed as possible with Vasopressin in place
   -Continue to follow cultures results
   3)Acidosis
   Anion Gap
Likely renal failure
   Non-Anion Gap
Likely related to saline given and volume expansion
   Respiratory Acidosis
Likely related to respiratory failure
   4)Rash
Evaluation by dermatology of great aid, appreciate input
   -Pred 20mg/d to discontinue today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with initial admission for rash and now presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure complicated by sepsis. The initial insult for respiratory failure may be aspiration event in the setting of delirium, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or alternative source of sepsis. The patient has been able to maintain improvement in oxygenation and stability of pressor requirements over the past 24 hours. However, there are concerns regarding the evolution of renal failure and persistent gap and non-gap acidosis with decreased pH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS): The patient is experiencing hypoxemia despite being on PEEP=18 and FIO2=0.5. Decreasing PEEP to 14 and maintaining the same driving pressure has resulted in an increase in Vt to 480 from 450cc, suggesting modest overdistention at previous PEEP. Further evaluation of ABG is needed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has significant pulmonary infiltrate and likely hospital-acquired pneumonia. Broad coverage antibiotics (Vanco, Cefepime, Ceftriaxone, Cipro, Flagyl) will be continued.

3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This is present but quite mild. Improved PEEP titration may help decrease CO2 levels at the next ABG.

4. Sepsis: The patient will continue on"

   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Likely in ARDS [**12-21**] underlying HAP or
   aspiration.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history
   puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less likely given no
   blood seen on bronch, stable HCT.
   - will wean PEEP and repeat ABG
   - continue Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro for HAP for now
   - d/c Ceftriaxone that was added yesterday bc concern for S pneumo
   (however now less likely as OSH BAL showed GBS)
   - f/u sputum, blood cultures
   - f/u ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on Levophed and vasopression.
   -continue to wean off pressors as tolerated
   - monitor UOP, SBPs
   -f/u cultures
   -hold metoprolol and lasix
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances:
   - pt has an AG of 11 (given low albumin, has an elev AG) that is likely
   [**12-21**] to uremia (lactate is nl, not diabetic)
   - pt also has a non-anion gap acidosis (given delta-delta calculation),
   likely [**12-21**] IVF with NS (no diarrhea, RTA also on diff)
   - pt also has respiratory acidosis (elev pCO2 on ABG) due to current
   respiratory failure
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis
   -wound care consult (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   -d/c steroids per derm
   -f/u any new derm recs
   -no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure: Cr up to 2.6 from 2.3. Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.  Also, could be prerenal from hypotension,
   dehydration.
   -renally dose medications
   -FeNa is 1.25% indicating instrinsic>prerenal etiology
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged acidemia.
   Currently, sedated, unresponsive to voice or pain.
   -consider window from sedation to assess neuro status more accurately
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during diuresis.
   -check PM lytes
   - consider free water flushes if Na continues to be elev
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was improving until Saturday when his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. He was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely in ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to underlying HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia) or aspiration. The TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) showed normal EF (ejection fraction), ruling out CHF (congestive heart failure). The patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Vasculitis in the lungs is less likely given no blood seen on bronchoscopy and stable HCT (hematocrit).

2. Hypotension: The patient likely has sepsis from an underlying lung infection. He is currently on Levophed and vasopressin. It is recommended to continue to wean off pressors as tolerated, monitor urine output and systolic blood pressures, follow up with cultures, and hold metoprolol and lasix.

3. Acid/base disturbances: The patient has an AG (anion gap) of 11, which"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was improving until Saturday when his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status. The patient was started on dopamine for hypotension and transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and hypotension.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal ejection fraction, ruling out congestive heart failure. The patient's smoking history puts him at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

2. Hypotension: The patient likely has septic shock from an underlying lung infection. He is currently on norepinephrine and vasopressin. The goal is to wean off pressors as tolerated, continue to treat the underlying infection, monitor urine output and systemic blood pressures, and follow up with cultures.

3. Acid/base disturbances: The patient continues to have anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to uremia. The respiratory acidosis seems to have resolved.

4. Rash: The patient has a rash diagnosed as leukoclastic vasculitis. Wound care is being provided, and the patient has been advised to discontinue the use"

   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Likely in ARDS [**12-21**] underlying HAP or
   aspiration.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history
   puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less likely given no
   blood seen on bronch, stable HCT.
   - will wean PEEP and repeat ABG
   - continue Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro for HAP for now
   - d/c Ceftriaxone that was added yesterday bc concern for S pneumo
   (however now less likely as OSH BAL showed GBS)
   - f/u sputum, blood cultures
   - f/u ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on Levophed and vasopression.
   -continue to wean off pressors as tolerated
   - monitor UOP, SBPs
   -f/u cultures
   -hold metoprolol and lasix
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances:
   - pt has an AG of 11 (given low albumin, has an elev AG) that is likely
   [**12-21**] to uremia (lactate is nl, not diabetic)
   - pt also has a non-anion gap acidosis (given delta-delta calculation),
   likely [**12-21**] IVF with NS (no diarrhea, RTA also on diff)
   - pt also has respiratory acidosis (elev pCO2 on ABG) due to current
   respiratory failure
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis
   -wound care consult (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   -d/c steroids per derm
   -f/u any new derm recs
   -no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure: Cr up to 2.6 from 2.3. Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.  Also, could be prerenal from hypotension,
   dehydration.
   -renally dose medications
   -FeNa is 1.25% indicating instrinsic>prerenal etiology
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged acidemia.
   Currently, sedated, unresponsive to voice or pain.
   -consider window from sedation to assess neuro status more accurately
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during diuresis.
   -check PM lytes
   - consider free water flushes if Na continues to be elev
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: patient in sinus here, holding metoprolol given
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism:
   -continue 37.5 mcg IV levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, presenting with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status.
- The patient was improving until Saturday when mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension.
- The patient was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
- The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, acid-base disturbances, rash, renal failure, altered mental status, hypernatremia, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely in ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to underlying HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia) or aspiration. Vasculitis in the lungs is less likely given no blood seen on bronchoscopy and stable hematocrit.
2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis from an underlying lung infection. He is currently on Levophed and vasopressin.
3. Acid-Base Disturbances: The patient has an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to uremia, a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to intravenous fluid administration, and respiratory acidosis due to current respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male here with respiratory failure--hypoxemic with ARDS and
   persistent sepsis in the setting of likely pulmonary source of
   infection.  He has significant and worsening renal function in what is
   quite likely ATN in the setting of sepsis and respiratory failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Persistence of severe compromise but have been
   able to wean FIO2 and PEEP with treatment optimized and ventilatory
   requirement decreasing
   -For Pneumonia-
   -Vanco/Acyclovir/Cipro/Cefepime/Flagyl
   -Sputum culture with group b strep from OSH
   -Given concern for cavitary lesions will need CT scan today
   -For Respiratory Failure Specifically-
   -Will decrease RR to 22 from 26 with concern for autopeep
   -Will maintaine PEEP and FIO2 as set given good response
   2)Sepsis-_Likely secondary to pulmonary source, has had some
   improvement with support
   -Continue with Levophed
   -Continue with volume support as needed.
   3)Acute Renal Failure_This is clearly worsening and remains most likely
   ATN-
   -Will follow urine lytes
   -Will provide free water and IVF
   -Will continue to support initial insult
   -Will check renal ultrasound
   -[**Month (only) 11**] need dialysis if continued worsening seen but this will have to be
   considered in light of his overall clinical picture.
   4)Atrial Fibrillation-Acute, seen transiently, minimal impact on blood
   pressure-
   -Follow rhythm
   -Anti-arrhythmic only if sustained or with impact on blood pressure

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. He is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient is on multiple antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and has shown some improvement in his condition. He is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he does have impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe respiratory compromise may lead to further deterioration and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient's sepsis may worsen if the source of infection is not adequately controlled.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function may progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or renal transplant.
4. ARDS: The patient's ARDS may not improve, leading to prolonged respiratory support and increased risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and other skin-related complications.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's acute atrial fibrillation may persist or recur, leading to potential hemodynamic instability and thromboembolic events.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension (not"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, presenting with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was initially improving but then experienced a worsening of his mental status, leading to intubation for respiratory failure and the initiation of dopamine for hypotension. He was transferred to another hospital for further management. The patient has been diagnosed with extensive left lower lobe pneumonia with a small parapneumonic effusion, and his condition has been complicated by sepsis, hypotension, acid-base disturbances, anemia, rash, renal failure, altered mental status, hypernatremia, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying health conditions, such as HAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia) or aspiration, may have contributed to his respiratory failure. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is a possibility. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: Sepsis from the underlying lung infection is likely causing the patient's hypotension. The patient is currently being treated with Levophed and vasopressin.
3. Acid-Base Disturbances: The patient has a mild non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
4. Anemia: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was initially improving but experienced a worsening of mental status and respiratory status, leading to intubation.

The patient has been diagnosed with extensive left lower lobe pneumonia with a small parapneumonic effusion. There are multiple areas of ground-glass attenuation and minimal consolidation elsewhere in the lungs, indicating early multifocal spread of pneumonia. The chest CT also shows hydrostatic edema, anasarca, and ascites. There is a hyperdense liver, which may be related to amiodarone therapy. The CT head did not reveal any evidence of acute hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarction.

The patient's blood cultures grew group B strep (GBS), and the respiratory culture showed moderate growth of beta streptococci, not group A. Legionella culture was negative, as well as fungal cultures. The OSH BAL showed group B strep.

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including respiratory failure likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration. Vasculitis in the lungs seems less likely given the absence of blood in the bronchus and stable hematocrit levels. The patient has hypotension likely secondary to sepsis from the underlying lung infection"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. The patient's condition has been improving until Saturday when his mental status worsened. He was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia) or aspiration. The TTE showed normal ejection fraction, ruling out CHF (congestive heart failure). The patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Vasculitis in the lungs is less likely given no blood seen on bronchoscopy and stable hematocrit.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis from the underlying lung infection. He is currently on Levophed and vasopressin. The plan is to continue to wean off pressors as tolerated, continue to treat the underlying infection, monitor urine output and systolic blood pressures, and follow up with cultures.
3. Acid/base disturbances: The patient continues to have anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to uremia (lactate is normal, not diabetic). The respiratory acidosis"

   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   #) SVT: pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was
   hemodynamically unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on
   levophed. In terms of etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to
   infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   #) Respiratory failure: Likely in ARDS [**12-21**] underlying HAP or
   aspiration.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history
   puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less likely given no
   blood seen on bronch, stable HCT. sputum cx grew GBS. ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was improving until his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status. The patient was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and hypotension.

The patient has multiple medical complications including:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely in ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia) or aspiration. A TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) showed normal EF (ejection fraction), ruling out CHF (congestive heart failure). The patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock from the underlying lung infection. He is currently on levophed and vasopressin.
3. Acid/base disturbances: The patient has a mild non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct (hematocrit) has been trending down. On admission, the Hct was 31.4. The patient may have DAH (acute blood loss anemia) given the CXR (chest X-ray) infiltrate.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   #) SVT: pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was
   hemodynamically unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on
   levophed. In terms of etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to
   infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - cardioversion when pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic instability
   - change levophed to neo.
   - transfuse 2u pRBC for volume repletion
   - continue treatment for respiratory infection
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH
   sputum was positive with GBS. Unsure whether GBS would give a toxic
   shock syndrome picture and lead to ARDS.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o
   CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis
   in lungs less likely given no blood seen on bronch, stable HCT.
   ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - advance ETT as the tube is too high
   - on PC, will decr RR further as pt appears to have autoPEEP and not
   able to breath out completely, and repeat ABG
   - continue Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro for HAP for now
   - consider decreasing vanc to 1gm q48h as vanc trough is 25.7, recheck
   vanc trough tomorrow
   - consult ID re antibiotic choice and whether clinda should be started
   to treat toxic shock syndrome
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. Pt has a coccyx
   ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has been
   negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/cipro for now
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - f/u cultures
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on Levophed and vasopression.
   - change levophed to neo in the setting of SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - monitor UOP, MAP, CVP
   - f/u cultures
   - hold metoprolol and lasix
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances: gap closed. Continues to mild non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct has been trending down. On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx
   includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic disease /
   inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - send Fe studies, B12, Folate, hemolysis labs
   - continue to monitor
   .

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia with associated parapneumonic effusion on chest CT. Non-group A strep was grown from sputum culture, and group B strep was identified in oral secretions. These findings suggest an infectious etiology for his respiratory failure.

2. Septic shock: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, likely due to the pulmonary infection. Other potential sources of infection include the gastrointestinal tract, but no evidence of GI infection is currently present.

3. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock secondary to the underlying lung infection. He is currently on Levophed and vasopressin for hemodynamic support.

4. Acid-base disturbances: The patient has a mild non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been trending down, indicating anemia. The differential diagnosis includes gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia of chronic disease/inflammation, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

6. Rash: The patient has a diffuse rash,"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with admission with ARDS secondary to pneumonia +/-
   aspiration and now with persistent respiratory failure complicated by
   acute renal failure and recurrent tachycardia.  He has had some
   improved compliance and improved oxygenation with good support but with
   recurrent and persistent tachycardia patient also maintains worsening
   renal function with creatinine increased to 3.0.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This would appear to be more easily supported
   this morning with PCV levels and FIO2 able to be decreased
   -Will decrease rate and PEEP today as tolerated.
   -Goal Pplat is much closer to 25
   2)Sepsis-This, again is most likely related to pulmonary source with
   Strep species and have been able to wean pressors to off only
   transiently and now with return to persistent levophed requirement.
   This likely represents continued vasodilatory shock
   -Continue with broad spectrum ABX
   -Keep CVP at 12
   -Will change pressors to non-beta agonist
   -He has had some decrease in fever and WBC count
   3)Tachycardia--Patient with recurrent AVNRT this morning
refractory to
   adenosine but responsive to cardioversion at 50 Joules x2.  This is in
   the setting of continued requirement for pressor support and continued
   SIRS with pneumonia slow to resolve.  This presented during rounds this
   morning
   -Will assure volume replete
   -Will continue to treat sepsis
   -If recurrent will need to move to non-beta agonist pressor
   -Cardioversion as needed today
   4)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Patient with continued and persistence of elevation in creatinine
   -Urine flow has been borderline
   5)Altered Mental Status
Patient with persistent decreased
   responsiveness but in the setting of high ventilator requirements and
   recurrent tachycardia with need for cardioversion it has been difficult
   to get a sustained time of hold on sedation to complete exam.  Head CT
   is reassuring.
   -Minimize sedation as possible today
   -Follow up neuro exam

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute renal failure. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PRES/AC mode. The vital signs show a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 119/26 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a CVP of 34.7 mmHg.

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 19.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 124 K/uL, creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 107 mg/dL, and potassium levels within normal range. The arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 223, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Imaging studies reveal pneumonia and consolidation in the left lung, as well as a small effusion. A head CT shows no bleed or infarction.

The patient's plan includes continuing with broad-spectrum antibiotics, keeping the CVP at 12, and weaning off pressors. The respiratory support will be adjusted based on the patient's tolerance, aiming for a goal plateau pressure of 25. Cardioversion may be performed as"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   #) SVT: pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was
   hemodynamically unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on
   levophed. In terms of etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to
   infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - cardioversion when pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   - continue treatment for respiratory infection
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH
   sputum was positive with GBS. Unsure whether GBS would give a toxic
   shock syndrome picture and lead to ARDS.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o
   CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis
   in lungs less likely given no blood seen on bronch, stable HCT.
   ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - advance ETT as the tube is too high
   - on PC, will decr RR further as pt appears to have autoPEEP and not
   able to breath out completely, and repeat ABG
   - continue Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro for HAP for now
   - consider decreasing vanc to 1gm q48h as vanc trough is 25.7, recheck
   vanc trough tomorrow
   - consult ID re antibiotic choice and whether clinda should be started
   to treat toxic shock syndrome
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/cipro for now
   - per ID, began penicillin G 4 million units IV q 4 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, continue the cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - Discontinued vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
   - restarted acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV q 8 hours for empiric therapy.
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - f/u cultures, will need to send another set of urine and blood
   culture as the most recent ones are from [**8-4**] and [**8-3**]
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdoment if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo.
   - changed levophed to neo in the setting of SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - monitor UOP, MAP, CVP
   - f/u cultures
   - hold metoprolol and lasix
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances: gap closed. Continues to mild non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct has been trending down. On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx
   includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic disease /
   inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed anemia of
   chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No evidence of
   hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal failure which
   also contributes to his anemia.
   - pt received 2u pRBC yesterday, Hct appropriately bumped. Goal Hct >30
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.0. Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and
   ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would consider that
   possibility given his picture of respiratory failure, renal failure,
   vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - renally dose medications
   - repeat UA urine lytes, consider renal consult if renal function
   continues to worse
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during
   diuresis.
   - continue  free water flushes to 250cc q3h
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: this morning was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), was
   condioverted
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who presented to the hospital with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was initially improving but then experienced a worsening of mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), respiratory failure likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), sepsis, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, anemia, rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He has undergone multiple interventions including cardioversion, changes in antibiotics, and fluid management. The patient's current goals of care include treating underlying infections, managing organ dysfunction, and providing supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's septic state and underlying comorbidities may lead to the involvement of other organs, resulting in complications like acute kidney injury (AKI) or hepatic dysfunction.
3. SVT recurrence: There is a possibility of recurrent SVT episodes, which can cause hemodynamic instability and potentially lead to arrhythmia-related complications.
4. Worsening renal function: The patient's renal"

   - had SVT X 3 today (3rd episode occurred around 4AM), converted with
   electric cardioversion -> now in sinus rhythm
   - stopped levothyroxine (started at outside hospital)
   - ID consult: See note in OMR.  Began penicillin G 4 million
   units IV q 4 hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   #) SVT: pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was
   hemodynamically unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on
   levophed. In terms of etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to
   infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - cardioversion when pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   - continue treatment for respiratory infection
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH
   sputum was positive with GBS. Unsure whether GBS would give a toxic
   shock syndrome picture and lead to ARDS.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o
   CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis
   in lungs less likely given no blood seen on bronch, stable HCT.
   ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - advance ETT as the tube is too high
   - on PC, will decr RR further as pt appears to have autoPEEP and not
   able to breath out completely, and repeat ABG
   - continue Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro for HAP for now
   - consider decreasing vanc to 1gm q48h as vanc trough is 25.7, recheck
   vanc trough tomorrow
   - consult ID re antibiotic choice and whether clinda should be started
   to treat toxic shock syndrome
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/cipro for now
   - per ID, began penicillin G 4 million units IV q 4 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, continue the cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - Discontinued vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
   - restarted acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV q 8 hours for empiric therapy.
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - f/u cultures, will need to send another set of urine and blood
   culture as the most recent ones are from [**8-4**] and [**8-3**]
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdoment if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo.
   - changed levophed to neo in the setting of SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - monitor UOP, MAP, CVP
   - f/u cultures
   - hold metoprolol and lasix
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances: gap closed. Continues to mild non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct has been trending down. On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx
   includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic disease /
   inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed anemia of
   chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No evidence of
   hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal failure which
   also contributes to his anemia.
   - pt received 2u pRBC yesterday, Hct appropriately bumped. Goal Hct >30
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.0. Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and
   ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would consider that
   possibility given his picture of respiratory failure, renal failure,
   vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - renally dose medications
   - repeat UA urine lytes, consider renal consult if renal function
   continues to worse
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during
   diuresis.
   - continue  free water flushes to 250cc q3h
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: this morning was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), was
   condioverted
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was initially improving but experienced a worsening of mental status and respiratory status, leading to intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, hypotension, acid-base disturbances, anemia, rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to his underlying lung infection. The source of infection is likely pulmonary, and there may also be a possibility of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has evidence of lower lobe lung consolidation consistent with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). There is also a risk of COPD exacerbation due to his smoking history.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis from the underlying lung infection.
4. Acid-Base Disturbances: The patient has mild non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease/inflammation, and his Hct has been trending down. Renal failure may also contribute to his anemia.
6. Rash: The patient has a rash that is likely secondary to toxic shock syndrome"

   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdoment if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo.
   - changed levophed to neo in the setting of SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - monitor UOP, MAP, CVP
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances: gap closed. Continues to mild non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 2u pRBC yesterday. On
   admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive,
   anemia of chronic disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate.
   Fe studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and
   folate are normal. No evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point.
   Patient also has renal failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - pt received 2u pRBC yesterday, Hct appropriately bumped. Goal Hct >30
   as he has SVT
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
   - per derm, pt was started on triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.0. Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and
   ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would consider that
   possibility given his picture of respiratory failure, renal failure,
   vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - renally dose medications
   - repeat UA urine lytes, consider renal consult if renal function
   continues to worse
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during
   diuresis.
   - continue  free water flushes to 250cc q3h
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: this morning was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), was
   condioverted
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. The patient was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and hypotension.

The patient has experienced several medical complications, including:

1. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient had multiple episodes of SVT, which were likely caused by infection, volume depletion, and the use of levophed (a beta1 agonist). Cardioversion was performed when the patient was hemodynamically unstable.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chest X-ray and CT scan showed evidence of left lower lobe consolidation, consistent with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Sputum culture grew non-group A strep, and OSH sputum was positive with Gram-negative bacilli (GBS). The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics for GBS and gram-negative coverage.

3. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, likely secondary to the pulmonary infection. Other potential sources of infection include the gastrointestinal tract, but there is no evidence of GI infection at this time.

4. Acid-Base Disturbances: The patient has mild non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with throat cancer, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia.
- The patient experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which were managed with cardioversion.
- The patient has a diffuse rash, but the cause is unclear.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate range of 43-164 bpm, blood pressure range of 53-119 mmHg, respiratory rate range of 19-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, unresponsive to commands.
- The patient has bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating worsening pneumonia.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels.
- The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain relievers.
- The patient's condition remains critical, requiring ongoing supportive care and close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and ongoing need for ventilator support, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or prolonged weaning from the ventilator.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of SVT and the use of cardioversion indicate a risk for recurrent arrhythmias, which may require"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has throat cancer and is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia. They also have a rash, which is unclear in its cause.

The patient underwent cardioversion/defibrillation multiple times for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Their vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate ranging from 66 to 164 bpm, blood pressure between 100/38 mmHg and 119/39 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19 and 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,718 mL and output of 745 mL since midnight. They are receiving various medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin), antivirals (acyclovir), and pain management medications (midazolam, fentanyl).

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 9.3 g/dL, elevated potassium levels at 5.6 mg/dL, and normal creatinine levels at 1.2 mg/dL. Other lab results show mild alterations in electrolytes and liver function tests.

Radiology findings reveal worsening bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Upon admission, the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He has been experiencing episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which have been managed with cardioversion. The patient also has hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and hypotension, but not in shock. He has impaired skin integrity, and there are concerns about acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.
3. ARDS or acute lung injury can progress to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), affecting other organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart.
4. Supraventricular tachycardia may recur and require further intervention.
5. Hypernatremia needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications like neurological dysfunction.
6. Hypotension may require ongoing monitoring and adjustment of fluid and medication therapy to maintain adequate blood pressure.
7. The patient's underlying hypertension and hyperlipidemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
8. Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can lead to deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, COPD, and HSV infection. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and supportive care. His vital signs remain stable, but he has shown some improvement in his chest X-ray. However, he continues to require high ventilator settings. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient is at risk for SVT, and pads have been placed for cardioversion if needed.
2. Pressor Needs Worsening: The patient's pressor needs have worsened over the past 24 hours, indicating a potential issue with hemodynamic stability.
3. Rash: The patient has developed a diffuse rash, which could be indicative of toxic shock syndrome or a hypersensitivity reaction to one of the medications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory requirements remain high, suggesting ongoing respiratory failure despite ventilatory support.
5. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient may be at risk for developing ARDS due to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
7. Non-gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, which requires further evaluation and management.
8. Throat Cancer: Although currently inactive, the patient's history of throat cancer needs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has been diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and is being monitored with pads for cardioversion as needed. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are relatively stable, but there has been an increase in pressor needs over the past 24 hours.

The patient also has a rash with unclear cause and is receiving supportive care. There are concerns about pneumonia or respiratory failure due to high vent requirements. Antibiotics have been continued, and the plan is to wean the vent as tolerated.

The patient's renal function is slowly worsening, and there is ongoing concern about throat cancer, which is currently considered an inactive issue. The patient has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is being treated with bronchodilators.

Additionally, the patient has an active herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, for which acyclovir has been continued. The patient received a blood transfusion yesterday for anemia and will require further monitoring and follow-up.

The patient's nutritional needs are being met through NovaSource Renal (Full) at 35 mL/hour. The patient has arterial and multi-lumen lines in place for monitoring and medication administration. Prophylactic measures are being taken to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient's condition"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has been diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (ARF), throat cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. However, the respiratory support indicates the need for mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. These settings suggest the presence of respiratory failure or difficulty in maintaining adequate gas exchange.

The patient's laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. The cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin-T) are within normal limits, indicating no evidence of acute myocardial infarction.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G potassium), pain management with fentanyl, vasopressor support with phenylephrine, and prophylactic heparin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male who presented to the hospital with symptoms of pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, acyclovir, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, and penicillin G potassium. He is also on infusions of fentanyl and phenylephrine, as well as heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/39 mmHg to 122/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 20 mL/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP >10.

Physical examination reveals diffuse rash, coarse lung sounds, hypoactive bowel sounds, trace edema in extremities, and unresponsive status with sedation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.4 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 124 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 28.3 mg/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.27, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 265, and base excess (BE) of -9 mEq/L. Chest X-ray (CXR) shows improvement in left greater than right basilar opacities.

The patient has several medical complications, including supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), rash likely due to toxic shock syndrome, pneumonia/respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), throat cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, anemia, and non-gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's current plan includes supportive care, continuation of antibiotics, weaning off the ventilator as tolerated, and addressing each of the individual medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH
   sputum was positive with GBS. Unsure whether GBS would give a toxic
   shock syndrome picture and lead to ARDS.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o
   CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis
   in lungs less likely given no blood seen on bronch, stable HCT.
   ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - on PC, will decr RR further as pt appears to have autoPEEP and not
   able to breath out completely, and repeat ABG
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection - f/u on Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody;
   Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM;
   Blood Smear For Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus
   B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes 6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdoment if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo.
   - changed levophed to neo in the setting of SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - monitor UOP, MAP, CVP
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) SVT: pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was
   hemodynamically unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on
   levophed. In terms of etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to
   infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - cardioversion when pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   - per ID, began penicillin G 4 million units IV q 4 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, continue the cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances: gap closed. Continues to mild non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 2u pRBC yesterday. On
   admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive,
   anemia of chronic disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate.
   Fe studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and
   folate are normal. No evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point.
   Patient also has renal failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - pt received 2u pRBC yesterday, Hct appropriately bumped. Goal Hct >30
   as he has SVT
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
   - per derm, pt was started on triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and
   ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would consider that
   possibility given his picture of respiratory failure, renal failure,
   vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - renally dose medications
   - repeat UA urine lytes, consider renal consult if renal function
   continues to worse
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during
   diuresis.
   - continue  free water flushes to 250cc q3h
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: this morning was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), was
   condioverted
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was improving until Saturday when his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. He was transferred to Hospital11 for management of respiratory failure and hypotension.

The patient has multiple medical issues, including respiratory failure, sepsis, hypotension, SVT, acid-base disturbances, anemia, rash, renal failure, altered mental status, hypernatremia, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypothyroidism.

Respiratory failure is indicated by the patient's presentation with fever, worsening respiratory status, and evidence of lung consolidation on CXR and CT. Sputum culture grew non-group A strep and OSH sputum was positive with GBS. The patient is being treated with penicillin G, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin.

Sepsis is suggested by the patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and worsening mental status. The source of infection is likely pulmonary given the evidence of LLL pneumonia on imaging. Other potential sources of infection include GI, but no evidence of GI infection is noted at this time.

Hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis from the underlying lung infection. The patient is currently on n"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure, and now in multi-organ failure
   (pulm, cardiac/SVT, renal, derm)
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH
   sputum was positive with GBS. Unsure whether GBS would give a toxic
   shock syndrome picture and lead to ARDS.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o
   CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis
   in lungs less likely. ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - on PC currently, will change back to AC today and see if he tolerates
   it. Get ABG to monitor respiratory status.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection, as per ID this presentation
   could represent HSV generalized infection
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. However, WBC trending
   down, and fever curve going down as well. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u on Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody; Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human
   granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For Parasites;
   Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella
   zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes 6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdoment if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo.
   - changed levophed to neo in the setting of SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - monitor UOP, MAP, CVP
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 24 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - cardioversion when pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   - per ID, began penicillin G 4 million units IV q 4 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, continue the cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances: gap closed. Continues to mild non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis and acute on chronic renal failure.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
   - per derm, pt was started on triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and
   ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would consider that
   possibility given his picture of respiratory failure, renal failure,
   vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - repeat UA urine lytes, consider renal consult if renal function
   continues to worse
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during
   diuresis.
   - change  free water flushes from 250cc q3h to 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient's condition initially improved until Saturday when his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status. He was transferred to this hospital for management of respiratory failure and is now in multi-organ failure (pulmonary, cardiac/SVT, renal, dermal).

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis, hypotension, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), metabolic acidosis, anemia, rash, and renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and tested positive for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in his sputum. He has also shown signs of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the underlying lung infection, and his renal failure is likely secondary to hypotension from sepsis. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to prolonged sepsis and sedation.

The patient has received various treatments including penicillin G, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, acyclovir, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 108/39 mm"

   CXR (my read): LLL infiltrate, worsened fluid on left (blunted left
   costodiaphagmatic angle
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure, and now in multi-organ failure
   (pulm, cardiac/SVT, renal, derm)
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH
   sputum was positive with GBS.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's
   smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less
   likely- ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - on  AC currently today
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day4), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day3) to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro (day 6) for gram-negative
   coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection, as per ID this presentation
   could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs
   - f/u cultures here and from OSH
   - if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. However, WBC trending
   down, and fever curve going down as well. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u on Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody; Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human
   granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For Parasites;
   Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella
   zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes 6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo.
   - continue neo in the setting of SVT with hemodynamic instability
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - monitor UOP, MAP, CVP
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 24 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   .
   #) Acid/base disturbances: gap closed. Continues to mild non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis and acute on chronic renal failure.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
   - per derm, pt was started on triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and
   ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would consider that
   possibility given his picture of respiratory failure, renal failure,
   vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Likely [**12-21**] volume depletion during
   diuresis.
   - continue free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer. He presented to the hospital with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. Initially, he showed improvement but then his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status. He was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and is now in multi-organ failure (pulmonary, cardiac/SVT, renal, dermal).

The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis, hypotension, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), acid-base disturbances, anemia, rash, renal failure, and altered mental status.

Respiratory failure is likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with non-group A strep and gram-negative bacilli identified in the sputum culture. The patient is being treated with penicillin G, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin.

Sepsis is suspected, with the source of infection likely pulmonary given the evidence of LLL pneumonia on imaging. Other sources of infection include the gastrointestinal tract, but there is no evidence of GI infection at this time.

Hypotension is likely due to sepsis from the underlying lung infection. The patient is currently on neomycin, and it is planned to continue treating the underlying infection.

SVT was present but did not recur during the past 24 hours. It"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with admission with hypoxemic respiratory failure now
   admitteed to ICU with persistent respiratory failure now complicated by
   persistent sepsis and worsening renal failure with Group B strep found
   in sputum as likely pathogen and may be link with rash with empiric
   treatment for TSS considered reasonable.  He has had continued maximal
   medical therapy and retains a persistent worsening in regards to sepsis
   and with progression of worsening renal failure seen. This remains most
   likely an evolution of hospital acquired pneumonia with subsequent
   sepsis and renal failure with Group B strep infection in pulmonary
   system now.  If this was present at admission is not clear but given
   initial clinical improvement Toxic Shock at admission is certainly less
   likely.
   '
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with persistent hypoxemic respiratory
   failure in the setting of pneumonia and small/moderate pleural effusion
   -Continue with A/C support
   -Will maintain FIO2
   -Have reasonable tolerance of volumes at this time
   2)Sepsis-Group B Strep
   -PCN D #4 and Clinda for inhibition of toxin production
   -Acyclovir and Doxycyclin in place with concern for oral lesion and
   possible RMSF
   -Will maintain Levophed support and fluid bolus as needed
   3) SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)-
   -Not recurrent at this time
   4)Renal Failure-
   -Will continue with foley catheter placement
   -Will minimize volume as possible with current sepsis
   -Will need to consider renal replacement therapy and support notn-gap
   acidosis as needed with HCO3-
   -Likely ATN will require continued supportive care.

   currently will maintain support with current family wishes and
   medically reasonable will have to continue full interventional
   treatment at this time but will not move to CPR for new catestrophic
   event
specifically CPR as this would represent a change with further
   decrease in any chance of being able to return to previous functional
   status.
   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
- He has been moved to the ICU due to persistent respiratory failure, complicated by sepsis and worsening renal failure.
- Group B strep has been found in the sputum, which is likely the pathogen causing the infection and may be linked to a rash.
- Empiric treatment for toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is being considered.
- The patient has continued to deteriorate despite maximal medical therapy.
- The current assessment suggests that this may be an evolution of hospital-acquired pneumonia with subsequent sepsis and renal failure caused by Group B strep infection in the pulmonary system.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the family has been updated on the situation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia and a small/moderate pleural effusion. He will continue to receive assisted ventilation support.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis caused by Group B strep. Antibiotics have been started to cover for inhibition of toxin production.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, and measures will be taken to minimize volume as possible with current sepsis. Renal replacement therapy and supportive care will be considered.
4. Supraventricular Tachycardia"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure, and now in multi-organ failure
   (pulm, cardiac/SVT, renal, derm)
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH
   sputum was positive with GBS.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's
   smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less
   likely- ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - on  AC currently today
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day4), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day3) to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro (day 6) for gram-negative
   coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection, as per ID this presentation
   could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs
   - f/u cultures here and from OSH
   - if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. However, WBC trending
   down, and fever curve going down as well. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg; f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For
   Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies;
   Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes 6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo and vasopressin.
   - avoid levophed given recent SVT
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure. Delta delta 0.52, so also has a
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic
   metabolic acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. has stablized.  Most
   likely [**12-21**] ATN from hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely
   given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would
   consider that possibility given his picture of respiratory failure,
   renal failure, vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
   - per derm, pt was started on triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p free water
   flushes q6h. now hyponatremic.
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 24 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was improving until Saturday when his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. He was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and now has multi-organ failure (pulmonary, cardiac/SVT, renal, dermal).

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia on CXR and CT, which may be contributing to his respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, likely due to the underlying lung infection. His blood cultures have been negative, and he has received broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to renal failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction, which may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension during sepsis.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient had hypernatremia initially but has now developed hyponatremia following free water flushes.
6. Skin rash: The patient has a diffuse pustular drug rash"

   likely infiltrate
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure, and now in multi-organ failure
   (pulm, cardiac/SVT, renal, derm)
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH
   sputum was positive with GBS.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's
   smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less
   likely- ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - on  AC currently today
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production, and cipro (day 1: [**8-3**]) for
   gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**])
   - f/u cultures here and from OSH
   - if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. However, WBC trending
   down, and fever curve going down as well. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg; f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For
   Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies;
   Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes 6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo and vasopressin.
   - avoid levophed given recent SVT
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure. Delta delta 0.52, so also has a
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic
   metabolic acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. has stablized.  Most
   likely [**12-21**] ATN from hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely
   given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would
   consider that possibility given his picture of respiratory failure,
   renal failure, vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
   - per derm, pt was started on triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p free water
   flushes q6h. now hyponatremic.
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 24 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was improving until Saturday when his mental status worsened and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. The patient was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and now presents with multi-organ failure (pulmonary, cardiac, renal, dermal).

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, rash, hyponatremia, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), anemia, altered mental status, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current medications include penicillin G, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, acyclovir, vasopressin, phenylephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusion, persistent left perihilar fullness, and likely infiltrate on chest X-ray. A CT scan of the lungs shows"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - continues on AC and pressors (5mcg neo)
   - added on 1.2 vasopressin due to low diastolic pressures in the 20s
   (SBP in 100s, but MAP in 40s), will obtain lactate now and at 10PM.  If
   continues (pt has had low diastolic pressures during this admission)
   - lactate: 2.1 and 1.9
   - still low MAPs, given 1000L LR bolus and 500cc LR bolus
   - ID recs: Likely group B strep vs. disseminated HSV.  continue
   acyclovir, penicillin G, clinda, cipro, doxy.  If RMSF serology
   negative, d/c doxy.  If pt decompensates, d/c penicillin and start
   zosyn.
   - derm recs: pustular drug rash appears to be improving.  Some purpura
   noticed on left forearm, does not appear c/w RMSF but awaiting
   serologies.
   - DNR but cardiovert with SVT

   CXR: bilateral pleural effusion, persistnet left perihilar fullness and
   likely infiltrate
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure, and now in multi-organ failure
   (pulm, cardiac/SVT, renal, derm)
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH
   sputum was positive with GBS.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's
   smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less
   likely- ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - on  AC currently today
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day4), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day3) to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro (day 6) for gram-negative
   coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection, as per ID this presentation
   could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs
   - f/u cultures here and from OSH
   - if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. However, WBC trending
   down, and fever curve going down as well. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg; f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For
   Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies;
   Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes 6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo and vasopressin.
   - avoid levophed given recent SVT
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure. Delta delta 0.52, so also has a
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic
   metabolic acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. has stablized.  Most
   likely [**12-21**] ATN from hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely
   given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would
   consider that possibility given his picture of respiratory failure,
   renal failure, vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
   - per derm, pt was started on triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p free water
   flushes q6h. now hyponatremic.
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 24 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .

   Disposition: ICU care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer. He presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient was intubated for worsening respiratory status and started on dopamine for hypotension. He was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure and now presents with multi-organ failure (pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and dermal).

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia on imaging, and the sputum culture grew out non-group A strep and OSH sputum positive with GBS. The patient is on antibiotics (penicillin G, clindamycin, and cipro) for suspected GBS infection and HSV infection.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, likely due to pulmonary infection. Blood cultures have been negative, and the source of infection may be gastrointestinal, although there is no evidence of GI infection at this time.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and likely has septic shock from the underlying lung infection. The patient is currently on neo and vasopressin.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure. Delta delta 0.52, so there is also a non-anion gap metabolic"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - continues on AC and pressors (5mcg neo)
   - added on 1.2 vasopressin due to low diastolic pressures in the 20s
   (SBP in 100s, but MAP in 40s), will obtain lactate now and at 10PM.  If
   continues (pt has had low diastolic pressures during this admission)
   - lactate: 2.1 and 1.9
   - still low MAPs, given 1000L LR bolus and 500cc LR bolus
   - ID recs: Likely group B strep vs. disseminated HSV.  continue
   acyclovir, penicillin G, clinda, cipro, doxy.  If RMSF serology
   negative, d/c doxy.  If pt decompensates, d/c penicillin and start
   zosyn.
   - derm recs: pustular drug rash appears to be improving.  Some purpura
   noticed on left forearm, does not appear c/w RMSF but awaiting
   serologies.

   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg; f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For
   Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies;
   Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes 6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo and vasopressin.
   - add levophed if continues to be hypotensive after IVF boluses
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure. Delta delta 0.52, so also has a
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic
   metabolic acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. has stablized.  Most
   likely [**12-21**] ATN from hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely
   given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would
   consider that possibility given his picture of respiratory failure,
   renal failure, vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
   - per derm, pt was started on triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p free water
   flushes q6h. now hyponatremic.
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 24 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was improving until Saturday when his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia, and his respiratory status has worsened, leading to intubation. He is currently on assisted ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with a likely source of infection being pulmonary due to evidence of pneumonia on imaging. Other potential sources include gastrointestinal infections, but no evidence of GI infection is present at this time.
3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressor support. The likely cause of hypotension is septic shock secondary to the underlying lung infection.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure. There is also a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal failure. This is most likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension during sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - continues on AC and pressors (5mcg neo)
   - added on 1.2 vasopressin due to low diastolic pressures in the 20s
   (SBP in 100s, but MAP in 40s), will obtain lactate now and at 10PM.  If
   continues (pt has had low diastolic pressures during this admission)
   - lactate: 2.1 and 1.9
   - still low MAPs, given 1000L LR bolus and 500cc LR bolus
   - ID recs: Likely group B strep vs. disseminated HSV.  continue
   acyclovir, penicillin G, clinda, cipro, doxy.  If RMSF serology
   negative, d/c doxy.  If pt decompensates, d/c penicillin and start
   zosyn.
   - derm recs: pustular drug rash appears to be improving.  Some purpura
   noticed on left forearm, does not appear c/w RMSF but awaiting
   serologies.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and started on dopamine for hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   management of respiratory failure, and now with renal failure as well.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS.  Patient received
   lots of IVF yesterday for hypotension, and this AM the CXR appeared
   more volume overloaded. TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's
   smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less
   likely- ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - on  AC currently, will decrease rate from 24 to 18, and monitor ABG
   to see if ventilation adequate
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production, and cipro (day 1: [**8-3**]) for
   gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures here and from OSH
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: Pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   likely pulmonary given CXR and CT evidence of LLL pneumonia. Other
   source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection at this
   time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg; f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For
   Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies;
   Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes 6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Hypotension: Likely [**12-21**] sepsis from underlying lung infection.
   Currently on neo and vasopressin.
   - avoid levophed given recent SVT
   - continue to treat underlying infection
   - continue to monitor, goal MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2
   >70%
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure. Delta delta 0.52, so also has a
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic
   metabolic acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. has stablized.  Most
   likely [**12-21**] ATN from hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely
   given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would
   consider that possibility given his picture of respiratory failure,
   renal failure, vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - re-started acyclovir per ID
   - per derm, pt was started on triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - d/c
d steroids per derm
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p free water
   flushes q6h. now hyponatremic.
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 24 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - levophed was changed to neo.
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was improving until Saturday when his mental status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status. The patient has been diagnosed with group B streptococci (GBS) pneumonia, sepsis, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, rash, hyponatremia, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), anemia, altered mental status, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation. However, there is a risk of continued respiratory failure due to underlying lung infection and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Sepsis: The patient is already septic and at risk of further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure, including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

3. Hypotension: The patient is currently hypotensive and receiving vasopressor support. There is a risk of ongoing hypotension and possible shock if the underlying causes are not adequately addressed.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with initial admission with bullous rash to [**Hospital3 1492**]
   now coming to [**Hospital1 1**] with persistent and signfiicant hypoxemic
   respiratory failure with left sided pneumonia now showing some capacity
   to wean ventilator support with some improvement in compliance.  His
   course, however, has been compliacated by Acute Renal Failure--with
   creatinine at likely plateau but with persistent hypotension consistent
   with slow to resolve sepsis.
   1) SHOCK, SEPTIC
Patient has persistent hypotension with CVP=10 on exam
   this morning, he has 2 pressor requirement and no new culture results
   suggesting the primary pulmonary insult is paramount.
   -Cipro/Acyclovir/Clinda/PCN/Doxycycline
   -Neo/Vasopressin in place and may need to add vasopressin
   -Will continue to bolus as needed but given decreased urine output and
   concern for evolution of pleural effusions will bias towards continued
   pressor support
   -He does have ECHO with only mild AI
   -Systolic BP >90 is goal for today
   -Will bolus for CVP <12 which is present this morning
   2)Respiratory Failure-Patient with persistent hypoxia but with improved
   FIO2 requirements.  He has mild respiratory alkalosis.  He does have
   decreased respiratory responsiveness but in the setting of persistent
   metabolic acidosis he will maintain high minute ventilation
   requirement.
   -Will trial decrease in RR to 18 today and recheck ABG
   -Will continue with current FIO2 and trial of decrease in PEEP should
   decrease in RR be tolerated
   -Will continuew tih PCN/Clinda/Cipro/Acyclovir and change to Zosyn for
   clinical worsening
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Patient has had Cr elevation which has actually reached plateau and
   has started to decrease
   -Will look to improve metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate should
   acidemia be significant
   -Will follow urine output going forward to look for recovery
   4)Metabolic Acidosis
Non-gap acidosis and anion gap acidosis is seen
   -Will move to LR for fluild support
   -Will continue to support renal function with adeuquate fluild delivery
   5)Rash
continue with creams per dermatology and do much appreciate
   input in regards to expanding differential diagnosis and considering
   interventions.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a bullous rash and later developed significant hypoxemic respiratory failure due to left-sided pneumonia. He has shown some improvement in compliance and capacity to wean off ventilator support.

However, the patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure, persistent hypotension, and a continued septic shock state. He requires two pressors to maintain blood pressure and is currently on midazolam, fentanyl, vasopressin, and phenylephrine infusions.

The patient also has respiratory failure with persistent hypoxia but improved oxygen requirements. He has mild respiratory alkalosis and decreased respiratory responsiveness. An ABG analysis showed a metabolic acidosis. The plan is to trial a decrease in respiratory rate to 18 and monitor the response.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure with a plateaued creatinine level. Measures will be taken to improve metabolic acidosis and closely monitor urine output for signs of recovery.

The patient is also experiencing metabolic acidosis, both non-gap and anion gap types. The plan includes moving to lactated Ringer's solution for fluid support and continuing to support renal function with adequate fluid delivery.

Finally, the patient has a rash that will be managed with creams prescribed by dermatology, and the differential diagnosis will be expanded upon, considering interventions.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise from the"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - At 10PM, SBP noted to be in the 70s despite neo and vasopressine.
   Lactate noted to increase from 1.9 to 2.7 and CVP 8-11, with urine
   output 15-30cc.  IVF boluses given (total 3L LR) and SBP remained low.
   - ABG looked more acidotic, going from 7.24/42/135/19 to
   7.24/32/130/12.  SBP still low, so levophed was added, in addition to
   neo and vasopressin.  The following ABG showed 7.25/28/104/13 with
   lactate 2.4.  Pressures stabilized and neo was successfully weaned.
   Now on Levo 0.15 and vaso 2.4 units/h.
   - ScvO2 86%, 87%.
   - [**Name (NI) **] son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 8278**], was updated about 10:30pm about the
   worsening sepsis. He came in to talk in the middle of the night, and
   was given further update. Very emotional as he is unsure whether the
   fact that he gave his father two advil caused all this.

   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status.
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS, pending
   sensitivities.  s/p 3L LR and CXR showing pleural effusions. TTE showed
   normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for
   COPD.
   - on  AC currently, rate decreasd from 24 to 18, and monitor ABG to see
   if ventilation adequate
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production, and cipro (day 1: [**8-3**]) for
   gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures here and from OSH
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given CXR and CT
   evidence of LLL pneumonia.   Received 3L IVF overnight, with addition
   of levophed due to SBP in the 70s.  Levophed was added and once
   pressures were stabilized, neo was weaned off.  Now on levo and vaso.
   Other source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection
   at this time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg;
   f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and
   IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes
   6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis. Also
   history of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to
   hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis from IVF.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2
2.8.  Most likely [**12-21**] ATN
   from hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for proper profusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider
   drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome cannot be
   exluded.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h. now hyponatremic with Na of 128..
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Stable.  Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged
   sepsis.  Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt
   does move extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any
   intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, presenting with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and sepsis. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including metabolic acidosis, renal failure, anemia, hyponatremia, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), anemia of chronic disease/inflammation, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis. It is important to monitor the patient's acid-base balance and continue to provide appropriate treatment.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution (LR) should be continued to maintain proper kidney perfusion. Renal dosing of medications and consideration of a renal consult if renal function continues to worsen are necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia of chronic disease/inflammation, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation, including guaiac testing of stools and monitoring of hemoglobin levels, is needed. Renal function should be supported to"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - At 10PM, SBP noted to be in the 70s despite neo and vasopressine.
   Lactate noted to increase from 1.9 to 2.7 and CVP 8-11, with urine
   output 15-30cc.  IVF boluses given (total 3L) and SBP remained low.
   - ABG looked more acidotic, going from 7.24/42/135/19 to
   7.24/32/130/12.  SBP still low, so levophed was added, in addition to
   neo and vasopressin.  The following ABG showed 7.25/28/104/13 with
   lactate 2.4.  Pressures stabilized and neo was successfully weaned.
   - ScvO2 86%, 87%.
   - [**Name (NI) **] son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 8278**], was updated about 10:30pm about the
   worsening sepsis. He came in to talk in the middle of the night, and

   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg;
   f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and
   IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes
   6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure. Delta delta 0.52, so also has a
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic
   metabolic acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. has stablized.  Most
   likely [**12-21**] ATN from hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely
   given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would
   consider that possibility given his picture of respiratory failure,
   renal failure, vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider
   drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome cannot be
   exluded.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h. now hyponatremic.
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was initially improving until his mental status worsened, leading to intubation for respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory failure.

Assessment:
1) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation, consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS. The patient received lots of IVF yesterday, and this morning the CXR appeared more volume overloaded. TTE showed normal EF, ruling out CHF. The patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD. Vasculitis in the lungs is less likely, as ANCA/Doctor's Last Name are negative.
- Continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
- Continue acyclovir for HSV infection.
- Follow ID recs.
- Goal SBP >85, UOP >30cc/hr, CVP >8, and ScvO2 >70%.
- Monitor lactate.
- Culture if spikes.
- Continue wound care for coccyx ulcer.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - At 10PM, SBP noted to be in the 70s despite neo and vasopressine.
   Lactate noted to increase from 1.9 to 2.7 and CVP 8-11, with urine
   output 15-30cc.  IVF boluses given (total 3L LR) and SBP remained low.
   - ABG looked more acidotic, going from 7.24/42/135/19 to
   7.24/32/130/12.  SBP still low, so levophed was added, in addition to
   neo and vasopressin.  The following ABG showed 7.25/28/104/13 with
   lactate 2.4.  Pressures stabilized and neo was successfully weaned.
   - ScvO2 86%, 87%.
   - [**Name (NI) **] son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 8278**], was updated about 10:30pm about the
   worsening sepsis. He came in to talk in the middle of the night, and

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status who was improving until Saturday when his mental
   status worsened, and he was intubated for worsening respiratory status
   and hypotension.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of respiratory
   failure.
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS.  Patient received
   lots of IVF yesterday for hypotension, and this AM the CXR appeared
   more volume overloaded. TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's
   smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Vasculitis in lungs less
   likely- ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] are neg.
   - on  AC currently, rate decreasde from 24 to 18, and monitor ABG to
   see if ventilation adequate
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production, and cipro (day 1: [**8-3**]) for
   gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures here and from OSH
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given CXR and CT
   evidence of LLL pneumonia.   Received 3L IVF overnight, with addition
   of levophed due to SBP in the 70s.  Levophed was added and once
   pressures were stabilized, neo was weaned off.
   Other source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection
   at this time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg;
   f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and
   IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes
   6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure. Delta delta 0.52, so also has a
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hyperchloremic
   metabolic acidosis.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2. has stablized.  Most
   likely [**12-21**] ATN from hypotension from sepsis. Vasculitis is less likely
   given neg [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA, but if renal function continues to worsen would
   consider that possibility given his picture of respiratory failure,
   renal failure, vasculitic skin lesions and anemia.
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider
   drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome cannot be
   exluded.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h. now hyponatremic.
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt does move
   extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was intubated for worsening respiratory status and hypotension. The patient's condition improved until Saturday when his mental status worsened, and he was transferred to another hospital for management of respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with positive sputum culture for Group B Streptococcus (GBS), sepsis, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, skin rash, hyponatremia, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), anemia, altered mental status, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently receiving various treatments including antibiotics for GBS infection, vasopressors for hypotension, renal dose medications, and wound care for a coccyx ulcer. The patient's family has a wait-and-see approach regarding his care.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing HAP
2. progression of sepsis leading to organ dysfunction
3. deterioration of renal function
4. development of acute kidney injury (AKI)
5. worsening metabolic acidosis
6. skin breakdown or infection at the site of the coc"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with admission with diffuse rash initially now to ICU with
   respiratory failure, sepsis and left lower lobe pneumonia.  He has
   evidence of persistent sepsis with recurrent hypotension noted
   overnight but this is in the setting of adjustment in pressor dosing
   rather than associated with elevation in temperature of WBC count which
   would argue for recurrent and severe sepsis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-he has persistent elevation in Ve and FIO2
   requirements leading to continued A/C support required.  We do need to
   see recovery of mental status before any move to spontaneous ventilator
   modes can be considered.
   -Will maintain A/C Support
   2)Sepsis-
   -Cipro/Acyclovir/Clinda/PCN/Doxycycline
   -Vasopressin and Levophed in place
   -Will move to bolus IVF as needed but do have excellent central venous
   saturation.
   3)Renal Failure--Patient with further decrease in creatinine but with
   stable urine output of approximately 450cc/day.  Will continue support
   -Will continue to support hemodynamics
   -Monitor urine output
   -Will consider volume challenge carefully in the setting of persistent
   moderate compromise of renal function.
   4)Rash-
   -Appreciate derm input and have continued with topical treatments as
   described.

   setting we have agreed to continue with full medical treatment, under
   guidance of DNR status for futher cardiac compromise.  We did agree to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with a diffuse rash, now in the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis, and left lower lobe pneumonia. He has persistent sepsis with recurrent hypotension, despite adjustments in pressor dosing. The patient requires continued mechanical ventilation and vasopressors to maintain hemodynamics. His renal function has worsened, with decreased urine output and increased creatinine levels. The patient's mental status is impaired, and he has a history of doxycycline allergy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires continued assisted mechanical ventilation support due to persistent elevation in Ve and FiO2 requirements.
2. Sepsis: The patient remains septic despite antibiotic therapy, and there is ongoing hypotension requiring vasopressors.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as evidenced by decreased urine output and increased creatinine levels.
4. Shock: The patient has recurrent hypotension, indicating possible septic shock.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may require careful management.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to prolonged immobility or pressure ulcers.
7. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient may be at risk for arrhythmias such as SVT, especially with the use of certain"

   CXR ([**2100-8-12**]): bilateral pleural effusion, persistnet left perihilar
   fullness and likely infiltrate
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status.
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS, pending
   sensitivities.  s/p 3L LR and CXR showing pleural effusions. TTE showed
   normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for
   COPD.
   - on  AC currently, rate decreasd from 24 to 18, and monitor ABG to see
   if ventilation adequate
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - d/c Cipro per ID
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures here and from OSH
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given CXR and CT
   evidence of LLL pneumonia.   Received 3L IVF overnight, with addition
   of levophed due to SBP in the 70s.  Levophed was added and once
   pressures were stabilized, neo was weaned off.  Now on levo and vaso.
   Other source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection
   at this time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg;
   f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For Parasites; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and
   IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes
   6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis. Also
   history of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to
   hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis from IVF.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2
2.8.  Most likely [**12-21**] ATN
   from hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for proper profusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider
   drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome cannot be
   exluded.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h. now hyponatremic with Na of 128..
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Stable.  Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged
   sepsis.  Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt
   does move extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any
   intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - family mtg yesterday: family has a

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and impaired skin integrity.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray and CT scan, consistent with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Sputum culture grew Group B streptococcus, pending sensitivities. The patient received 3 liters of IV fluids overnight and levophed was added due to low blood pressure. Levophed was weaned off once pressures were stabilized, and now the patient is on norepinephrine and vasopressin.

2. Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given the evidence of LLL pneumonia. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, including penicillin G for Group B streptococcus, clindamycin to inhibit toxin production, and ciprofloxacin for gram-negative coverage. Acyclovir has also been started for HSV infection.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 3.2, indicating acute renal failure. This is likely due to hypotension from sepsis. The patient is"

   the right base.
   CXR ([**2100-8-12**]): bilateral pleural effusion, persistnet left perihilar
   fullness and likely infiltrate
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**], renal failure and
   altered mental status.
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS.  TTE showed normal
   EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Pt
   has HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip). This
   respiratory failure could potentially be secondary to generalized HSV
   infection
   - on  AC currently, rate decreasd from 24 to 18, PEEP decreased from 8
   to 5, ABG good. Attempt to switch to PS.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given CXR and CT
   evidence of LLL pneumonia.   Received 3L IVF overnight, with addition
   of levophed due to SBP in the 70s.  Levophed was added and once
   pressures were stabilized, neo was weaned off.  Now on levo and vaso.
   Other source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection
   at this time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - as HSV could cause adrenalitis, would check [**Last Name (un) **] stim test per ID
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg;
   f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19
   Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   - continue to follow renal function and lactate levels\
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr stable at 2.9 to 3.0.  Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for proper perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**]. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis. derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction:
   consider drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome
   cannot be exluded.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Exam revealed some stereotypical decorticate
   reflexes. Unclear whether it is HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**]
   sedation and prolonged sepsis.  Last CT head was negative for any
   intracranial process.
   -repeat CT head today
   -consider MRI if CT is neg
   -consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - family mtg yesterday: family has a

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who presented to the hospital with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS). The patient also has a generalized HSV infection, as indicated by positive HSV cultures from the nasopharynx and lip. He is currently being treated with penicillin G, clindamycin, and acyclovir. The patient's sepsis is suspected to be pulmonary in origin, with possible bowel ischemia contributing to bacteremia. His metabolic acidosis is likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis. He has renal failure, likely due to hypotension from sepsis, and his anion gap has improved significantly. The patient's skin condition is being managed with clindamycin and acyclovir, and his wound care includes triamcinolone ointment and Aquafor. His altered mental status may be due to HSV encephalitis, prolonged sedation, or sepsis. Further imaging and lumbar puncture may be considered. The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease/inflammation, and his hyponatremia has resolved. He experienced supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) but is currently stable, and his transaminitis"

   CXR ([**2100-8-12**]): bilateral pleural effusion, persistnet left perihilar
   fullness and likely infiltrate
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure and
   altered mental status.
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS, pending
   sensitivities.  s/p 3L LR and CXR showing pleural effusions. TTE showed
   normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for
   COPD.
   - on  AC currently, rate decreasd from 24 to 18, and monitor ABG to see
   if ventilation adequate
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - d/c Cipro per ID
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures here and from OSH
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given CXR and CT
   evidence of LLL pneumonia.   Received 3L IVF overnight, with addition
   of levophed due to SBP in the 70s.  Levophed was added and once
   pressures were stabilized, neo was weaned off.  Now on levo and vaso.
   Other source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection
   at this time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg;
   f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Blood Smear For Parasites; BabTITLE:
   esia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella
   zoster Antibody, IgM; Herpes 6 PCR
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: gap 11, albumin 1.7, so continues to have an
   anion gap, likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis. Also
   history of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to
   hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis from IVF.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr trending up 1.9---3.2
2.8.  Most likely [**12-21**] ATN
   from hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for proper profusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin rash, and  will
   aggressively resuscitate with LR today
   - renally dose medications
   - consider renal consult if renal function continues to worse
   .
   #) Rash: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin rash. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis.
   - derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider
   drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome cannot be
   exluded.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin rash
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h. now hyponatremic with Na of 128..
   - d/c free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Stable.  Likely [**12-21**] sedation and prolonged
   sepsis.  Currently, sedated, no corneal or pupil reflexes, however pt
   does move extremities to pain. CT head was negative for any
   intracranial process.
   -neuro exam when sedation is lightened
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, presenting with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He was admitted to the hospital on [**7-24**] and diagnosed with respiratory failure due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), sepsis, acute renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care. His current vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusion and likely infiltrate in the left lower lobe of the lung. The patient's medical team has made several decisions regarding his care, including continuing penicillin G and clindamycin for suspected Group B Streptococcus infection, discontinuing ciprofloxacin, initiating acyclovir for herpes virus infection, and restarting TF. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of additional infections, and cardiovascular instability."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with admission with sepsis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure and persistent alteration of mental status despite
   discontinuation of sedating medications.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-_Has persistent high
   requirements but have been able to decrease PEEP through to this
   morning
   -Will move to pressure support trial given spontaneous respiration
   -Continue PEEP at 5 and move to PSV at 15-20
   2)SHOCK, SEPTIC-
   -Infectious source is led by group B strep--with sensitivities note
   seen on BAL specimen and sputum
   -We have new findings of HSV changes in nasal swab from testing
   performed on [**8-7**].  This does raise the question of a generalized HSV
   infection with skin involvement is interesting.  Do have Acyclovir in
   place since [**8-4**] and with persistent compromise will move to empiric
   steroid start at this time with ID service counsel
   -We do have persistent requirements for pressor support
   -PCN G/clindamycin/Doxycycline/Acyclovir all in place
   -Will continue Levophed and Vasopressin
   3)RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-Have seen plateau but
   failure to improve creatinine at this time.  We do have a severe
   metabolic acidosis and will use HCO3- as needed
   Will hold on dialysis at this time given capacity to improve ventilator
   support levels..
   4)ALTERED MENTAL STATUS-
   -some grimace to pain and spontaneous movement noted this morning
   -The problem this morning
is that he has significant concern for
   persistent decorticate posturing
   -CT scan this morning

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and persistent alteration of mental status. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent high requirements for ventilator support but has been able to decrease PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). The plan is to move to pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 15-20 with continued PEEP at 5.

2. Septic Shock: The infectious source is led by group B strep, with sensitivities noted on BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) specimen and sputum. The patient is already on antibiotics (penicillin G, clindamycin, doxycycline, and acyclovir) and will continue pressor support with Levophed and Vasopressin.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine has plateaued, but there is a failure to improve. There is severe metabolic acidosis, and bicarbonate will be used as needed. Dialysis is being held for now due to the ability to improve ventilator support levels.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient shows some response to pain and spontaneous movement, but there is significant concern for persistent decorticate posturing. A CT scan is planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - PS trial lasted 45 minutes, but became hypotensive and had to place
   back on AC
   - due to hypotension on pressure support had to increase levo (from
   0.04 to 0.08) and vasopressin (2.4)
   - at midnight, increased levo further to 0.1.  Also gave 1L LR bolus.
   - blood, urine, sputum cultures sent (given hypothermia)
   - d/w ID: HSV treatment.  Cortisol stimulation test, changed acyclovir
   to 300-600mg daily, and consider LP.  Contact precautions for 5 days.
   consider MRI if CT neg.
   - get CT for triple flexion reaction (decorticate response): prelim
   read: 1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage. 2. Extensive vascular
   calcifications. Please note that MRI is more sensitive in detection of
   acute ischemia.

   CXR ([**8-13**]) my read: bilateral pleural effusion, L>R.
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**], renal
   failure and altered mental status.
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS.  TTE showed normal
   EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Pt
   has HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip). This
   respiratory failure could potentially be secondary to generalized HSV
   infection
   - CXR appears slightly better with less infiltrates ([**8-13**])
   - on  AC currently, will attempt to decrease RR and decrease Vt
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given CXR and CT
   evidence of LLL pneumonia.   Other source of infection includes GI but
   no evidence of GI infection at this time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on
   [**8-3**] showed small amount of pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis
   was seen. However, given pt is intermittently hypotensive, it is
   possible that pt has some degree of bowel ischemia leading to
   bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a coccyx ulcer but the wound does
   not appear infected. Blood culture has been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**]
   showed no vegetation. No evidence of sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT
   sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - as HSV could cause adrenalitis, [**Last Name (un) **] stim test done per ID, will f/u
   results-
 neg
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg;
   f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19
   Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM
   - will aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - wean down pressors as pt has evidence of digital ischemia now
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   - continue to follow renal function and lactate levels
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr stable at 2.9 to 3.0.  Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for proper perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**]. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis. derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction:
   consider drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome
   cannot be exluded.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Exam revealed some stereotypical decorticate
   reflexes. Unclear whether it is HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**]
   sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer.
- He presented with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status.
- He has been intubated for 12 days and is currently on pressure support (PS) due to hypotension.
- His blood cultures are pending, and he has tested positive for HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip).
- He also has a history of smoking, which puts him at risk for COPD.
- The source of infection is likely pulmonary given the evidence of LLL consolidation on CXR and CT.
- Other sources of infection include GI, but no evidence of GI infection is currently noted.
- The patient's sepsis is being treated with penicillin G, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin.
- His metabolic acidosis is likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis.
- He has renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.9 to 3.0, most likely due to hypotension from sepsis.
- His skin condition is worsening, with a diagnosis of leukoclastic vasculitis or toxic shock syndrome.
- He has altered mental status with some stereotypical decorticate reflexes, possibly due to HSV encephalitis.
- His anemia is likely secondary"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - PS trial lasted 45 minutes, but became hypotensive and had to place
   back on AC
   - due to hypotension on pressure support had to increase levo (from
   0.04 to 0.08) and vasopressin (2.4)
   - at midnight, increased levo further to 0.1.  Also gave 1L LR bolus.
   - blood, urine, sputum cultures sent (given hypothermia)
   - d/w ID: HSV treatment.  Cortisol stimulation test, changed acyclovir
   to 300-600mg daily, and consider LP.  Contact precautions for 5 days.
   consider MRI if CT neg.
   - get CT for triple flexion reaction (decorticate response): prelim
   read: 1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage. 2. Extensive vascular
   calcifications. Please note that MRI is more sensitive in detection of
   acute ischemia.
   - at 6AM, Ca was found to be 2.8.  Ionized calcium sent, given calcium
   gluconate 4g IV X 1.  EKG checked.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**], renal failure and
   altered mental status.
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS.  TTE showed normal
   EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Pt
   has HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip). This
   respiratory failure could potentially be secondary to generalized HSV
   infection
   - on  AC currently, continue the current setting. Failed PS attempt
   yesterday due to hypotension.
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given CXR and CT
   evidence of LLL pneumonia.   Received 3L IVF overnight, with addition
   of levophed due to SBP in the 70s.  Levophed was added and once
   pressures were stabilized, neo was weaned off.  Now on levo and vaso.
   Other source of infection includes GI but no evidence of GI infection
   at this time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on [**8-3**] showed small amount of
   pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt
   is intermittently hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree
   of bowel ischemia leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a
   coccyx ulcer but the wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - as HSV could cause adrenalitis, [**Last Name (un) **] stim test done per ID, will f/u
   results
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg;
   f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19
   Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   - continue to follow renal function and lactate levels
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr stable at 2.9 to 3.0.  Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for proper perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**]. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis. derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction:
   consider drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome
   cannot be exluded.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Exam revealed some stereotypical decorticate
   reflexes. Unclear whether it is HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**]
   sedation and prolonged sepsis.  CT head x2 were negative for any
   intracranial process.
   -consider MRI
   -consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   -continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 2u pRBC on [**8-6**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct >30 as he has SVT
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who presented to the hospital with fever, diffuse desquamating rash, renal failure, and altered mental status. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and a positive Gram stain for Group B Streptococcus (GBS). He also has sepsis with likely pulmonary source, HSV infection, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has renal failure likely due to hypotension from sepsis. Other conditions include leukoclastic vasculitis, altered mental status possibly due to HSV encephalitis or prolonged sepsis, anemia of chronic disease/inflammation, hyponatremia, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and transaminitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening sepsis leading to organ dysfunction, progression of renal failure, worsening metabolic acidosis, worsening anemia, recurrent SVT, and further deterioration in mental status.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to generalized HSV infection and HAP. He has been treated with penicillin G and clindamycin to inhibit toxin production and ciprofloxacin for gram-negative coverage. Acyclovir has been continued for HSV infection. The patient's sepsis is being treated with appropriate antibiotics, and his renal function is being monitored."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with admission for respiratory failiure, sepsis now
   complicated by persistent hypotension and slow to improve mental
   status.  He has persistent hypotension and has been unable to achieve
   hemodynamic stability which does raise the question of potential
   compromise of adrenal function in the setting of what may be
   disseminated HSV infection.  If this is true then we will have to
   consider steroid replacement therapy which will have to be driven be
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim testing.
   1)Respiratory Failure-_This is secondary to pneumonia with left lower
   lobe involvement which actually has shown some readiographic
   improvement.
   -Will decrease RR to 14 and decrease Vt to 500
   -Do have good improvement in lung mechanics and oxygenation suggested
   -Continue to Rx infectious sources
   2)Sepsis-
   -Patient currently on levophed, vasopressin
   -Will wean pressors at tolerated today---trial fluild bolus today
   liter and move to decrease pressor and repeat until able to wean
   pressors to off.  Will need maintenance fluild if able to stabilize
   -Strep Pneumonia
   --PCN G/Clindamycine
   -HSV/Possible adrenal insufficiency
   -Acyclovir
   -Do not see role for steroid Rx
   3)Renal Failure
Improved non-gap acidosis, urine output improving
   -Will enhance volume status
   4)Altered Mental Status-CT reassuring, some increased movement today
   -Follow exam
   -Minimize sedation

","The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted for respiratory failure and sepsis, now complicated by persistent hypotension and slow-to-improve mental status. The patient has persistent hypotension and has been unable to achieve hemodynamic stability, raising the question of potential compromise of adrenal function in the setting of disseminated HSV infection. If this is true, steroid replacement therapy may be necessary, driven by [**Last Name (un)**] stim testing.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: Secondary to pneumonia with left lower lobe involvement. There is some radiographic improvement, so the plan is to decrease RR to 14 and Vt to 500, continue to Rx infectious sources, and monitor improvement in lung mechanics and oxygenation.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on levophed and vasopressin. The plan is to wean pressors at tolerated today, with a trial fluid bolus today and moving to decrease pressor and repeat until able to wean pressors to off. Maintenance fluid may be needed if able to stabilize. The source of infection is Strep Pneumonia, and antibiotics will be continued with PCN G/Clindamycine. Acyclovir will also be administered due to HSV infection and possible adrenal insufficiency.

3. Renal Failure: There has been an improvement in non-gap acidosis, and urine output is improving. The plan is to enhance volume"

   - BAL and nasopharyngeal swab HSV DFA and viral cultures sent
   - didn't change vent settings as RT didn't feel comfortable decreasing
   RR or Vt
   - given 2L LR and 1u pRBC in an attempt to decrease pressor requirement
   and keep up with the large insensible loss from skin
   - ordered 150meq bicarb to see if it helps with acidosis and decrease

   CXR ([**8-14**]): study not done yet
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who presented on [**7-24**] to [**Hospital1 **] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**], renal
   failure and altered mental status.
   #) Respiratory failure: CXR and CT evidence of LLL consolidation,
   consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS.  TTE showed normal
   EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Pt
   has HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip). This
   respiratory failure could potentially be secondary to generalized HSV
   infection
   - CXR appears slightly better with less infiltrates ([**8-13**])
   - on  AC currently, will attempt to decrease RR and decrease Vt
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - added doxy per ID recs (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF from OSH,  d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given CXR and CT
   evidence of LLL pneumonia.   Other source of infection includes GI but
   no evidence of GI infection at this time, no diarrhea noted. KUB on
   [**8-3**] showed small amount of pericholecystic fluid, but no cholecystitis
   was seen. However, given pt is intermittently hypotensive, it is
   possible that pt has some degree of bowel ischemia leading to
   bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a coccyx ulcer but the wound does
   not appear infected. Blood culture has been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**]
   showed no vegetation. No evidence of sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT
   sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production, and cipro for gram-negative coverage.
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - as HSV could cause adrenalitis, [**Last Name (un) **] stim test done per ID, will f/u
   results-
 neg
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: Lyme IgG/IgM Antibody neg;
   f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19
   Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM
   - will aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - wean down pressors as pt has evidence of digital ischemia now
   - continue to monitor, goal SBP>85 (not , UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and
   ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give bicarb today, increase RR when giving bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   - continue to follow renal function and lactate levels
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr stable at 2.9 to 3.0.  Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for proper perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**]. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis. derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction:
   consider drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome
   cannot be exluded.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)

   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family
   - will need to watch this weekend, and see if he improves

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who presented with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating skin lesions, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has tested positive for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in his sputum culture. He also has a generalized HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip). The patient's respiratory failure could potentially be secondary to the generalized HSV infection.

The patient's sepsis is likely due to pulmonary infection, with evidence of consolidation on chest X-ray and CT. The source of infection may be gastrointestinal as well, but there is no current evidence of GI infection. The patient has been treated with penicillin G, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin for GBS and pulmonary infection.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis. Renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 2.9 to 3.0, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis from hypotension caused by sepsis.

The patient has leukoclastic vasculitis on his lower extremities, which may be related to toxic shock syndrome or a drug reaction. He is being treated with clindamycin to inhibit toxin production and acyclovir for HSV infection.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   renal failure and altered mental status.
   #) Respiratory failure: Initial CXR and CT evidence of LLL
   consolidation, consistent with HAP. Sputum culture grew out GBS.
   Patient has been treated with penicillin G and clinda, and his
   pneumonia is improving on imaging. TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF.
   Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Pt has HSV
   infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip). This respiratory
   failure could potentially be secondary to generalized HSV infection,
   the HSV DFA and culture from mini-BAL are pending. The current barriers
   to extubation include altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis,
   bilateral pleural effusion, and pneumonia which is improving.
   - on  AC currently, RR increased from 18 to 22 in an attempt to blow
   off CO2 when he is being given bicarb
   - continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the drug of
   choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1:
   [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per ID this
   presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - continue doxy (day1: [**8-8**]);  if no RMSF,  will d/c doxy
   - given bicarb (150meq in 1000cc D5W) x1 today, re-check lytes in the
   pm and see if metabolic acidosis improves. If it did, can give another
   dose of bicarb
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal. Other source of infection includes
   GI but no evidence of GI infection at this time, no diarrhea noted. KUB
   on [**8-3**] showed small amount of pericholecystic fluid, but no
   cholecystitis was seen. However, given pt is intermittently
   hypotensive, it is possible that pt has some degree of bowel ischemia
   leading to bacteremia. UA was negative. Pt has a coccyx ulcer but the
   wound does not appear infected. Blood culture has been negative, and
   TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of sinusitis, so wouldn
   get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia
   Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster
   Antibody, IgM
   - will aggressively resuscitate with LR.  wean down pressors as pt has
   evidence of digital ischemia now. Goal MAP 55 (given his very low
   diastolic), although it would still be ideal to get his MAP to 65 to
   adequately perfuse his brain for improvement in mental status
   - hope to decrease his pressor requirements when metabolic acidosis
   improves on bicarb
   - goal I/O at least 1 liter positive as pt has lots of insensible fluid
   loss from skin
   - goal UOP>30cc/hr, CVP >[**8-30**] and ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - culture if spikes
   - continue wound care for coccyx ulcer
   - would consider CT abdomen if pt does not improve
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give bicarb today, increase RR from 18 to 22  when giving bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   - continue to follow renal function and lactate levels
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**]. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis. derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction:
   consider drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome
   cannot be exluded. Less likely HSV [**Hospital1 5286**], but it it not completely
   impossible.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Exam revealed some stereotypical decorticate
   reflexes. Unclear whether it is HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**]
   sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain (goal
   MAP 65 but it may not be a realistic goal as the diastolic pressure has
   been very low). For now, maintain goal MAP at least 55 with IVF first,
   if still low then up the pressors. Hoping bicarb will help with
   acidosis and decrease pressor requirements and help with blood
   pressure.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with admission for respiratory failiure, sepsis now
   complicated by persistent hypotension and slow to improve mental
   status.  He has persistent hypotension and has been unable to achieve
   hemodynamic stability which does raise the question of potential
   compromise of adrenal function in the setting of what may be
   disseminated HSV infection.  If this is true then we will have to
   consider steroid replacement therapy which will have to be driven be
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim testing.
   1)Respiratory Failure-_This is secondary to pneumonia with left lower
   lobe involvement which actually has shown some readiographic
   improvement.
   -Will decrease RR to 14 and decrease Vt to 500
   -Do have good improvement in lung mechanics and oxygenation suggested
   -Continue to Rx infectious sources
   2)Sepsis-
   -Patient currently on levophed, vasopressin
   -Will wean pressors at tolerated today---trial fluild bolus today
   liter and move to decrease pressor and repeat until able to wean
   pressors to off.  Will need maintenance fluild if able to stabilize
   -Strep Pneumonia
   --PCN G/Clindamycine
   -HSV/Possible adrenal insufficiency
   -Acyclovir
   -Do not see role for steroid Rx
   3)Renal Failure
Improved non-gap acidosis, urine output improving
   -Will enhance volume status
   4)Altered Mental Status-CT reassuring, some increased movement today
   -Follow exam
   -Minimize sedation

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted for respiratory failure, sepsis, and suspected disseminated HSV infection. He has multiorgan failure, including respiratory failure, renal failure, shock, acidosis, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition remains unstable despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Secondary to pneumonia with left lower lobe involvement. Improvement is observed in lung mechanics and oxygenation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on levophed and vasopressin. Pressor weaning will be attempted today, along with fluid bolus and repeat until pressors can be weaned off. Strep Pneumonia is suspected, and antibiotics will be adjusted accordingly.
3. Renal Failure: Improved non-gap acidosis and urine output. Enhancing volume status will be done.
4. Altered Mental Status: CT reassuring, with some increased movement today. Minimizing sedation will be continued.
5. Shock: Remains pressor-dependent on vasopressin and levophed. Avoiding further volume resuscitation and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >55 with pressors will be the goal.
6. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): Ongoing assessment and management will be performed.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   #) Respiratory failure:  In the context of GBS pneumonia.  Patient has
   been treated with penicillin G and clinda, and his pneumonia is
   improving on imaging.  This respiratory failure could potentially be
   secondary to generalized HSV infection, the HSV DFA and culture from
   mini-BAL are pending. The current barriers to extubation include
   altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, bilateral pleural
   effusion, and pneumonia which is improving.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o
   CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Pt has HSV
   infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip).
   - on  AC currently, RR increased from 18 to 26 in an attempt to blow
   off CO2 when he is being given bicarb
   - continue day 10 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the
   drug of choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours
   (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - continue day 12 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - continue day 8 of doxy for possible tick borne illness (day1: [**8-8**]);
   if no RMSF,  will d/c doxy
   - given bicarb (150meq in 1000cc D5W) x1 yesterday, re-check lytes in
   the pm and see if metabolic acidosis improves. If it did, consider
   giving another dose of bicarb
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.  Continues to remain remain
   pressors-dependent on vasopressin and levophed.  UA was negative. Blood
   culture has been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No
   evidence of sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia
   Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster
   Antibody, IgM
   - wean down pressors as pt has evidence of digital ischemia now. Goal
   MAP 55 (given his very low diastolic), although it would still be ideal
   to get his MAP to 55 to adequately perfuse his brain for improvement in
   mental status
   - with ongoing pleural effusions and nl CVP, would attempt to maintain
   MAP with pressors rather than IVF
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give bicarb today, increase RR from 18 to 26  when giving bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**]. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis. derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction:
   consider drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome
   cannot be exluded. Less likely HSV [**Hospital1 5286**], but it it not completely
   impossible.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Exam revealed some stereotypical decorticate
   reflexes. Unclear whether it is HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**]
   sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain (goal
   MAP 65 but it may not be a realistic goal as the diastolic pressure has
   been very low). For now, maintain goal MAP at least 55 with IVF first,
   if still low then up the pressors. Hoping bicarb will help with
   acidosis and decrease pressor requirements and help with blood
   pressure.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - transfuse one unit prbcs today cautiously given volume status
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued
   -continue to monitor
   -PM lytes
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family
   - will need to watch this weekend, and see if he improves
   - will need to discuss tracheostomy early next week, patient will have
   been intubated for 2 weeks on Monday

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He was transferred from another hospital and found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis, as well as multiorgan failure (renal failure, respiratory failure, shock, acidosis). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, skin rash, altered mental status, anemia, hyponatremia, and a history of SVT and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been treated for GBS pneumonia, but there are still barriers to extubation including altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, bilateral pleural effusion, and improving pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his pneumonia. Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is less likely.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient continues to have an anion gap, likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly improved.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension during sepsis. Supportive measures are being taken to maintain adequate blood pressure and fluid resuscitation.

5. Skin Rash: The patient has a diffuse erythematous rash all over the body, which is"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:  In the context of GBS pneumonia.  Patient has
   been treated with penicillin G and clinda, and his pneumonia is
   improving on imaging.  This respiratory failure could potentially be
   secondary to generalized HSV infection, the HSV DFA and culture from

   pm and see if metabolic acidosis improves. If it did, can give another
   dose of bicarb
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs

   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.  Continues to remain remain

   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give bicarb today, increase RR from 18 to 22  when giving bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF

   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys

   #) Altered mental status: Exam revealed some stereotypical decorticate
   reflexes. Unclear whether it is HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**]
   sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now

   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21

   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued
   - continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic

   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family
   - will need to watch this weekend, and see if he improves
   - will need to discuss tracheostomy early next week, patient will have
   been intubated for 2 weeks on Monday

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has diffuse desquamating skin lesions, GBS pneumonia, sepsis, and multiorgan failure (renal failure, respiratory failure, shock, acidosis). The patient is intubated and sedated, with altered mental status. He has been treated with penicillin G, clindamycin, and acyclovir. The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to generalized HSV infection, and the current barriers to extubation include altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, bilateral pleural effusion, and pneumonia which is improving. The patient also has renal failure, metabolic acidosis, anemia, hyponatremia, SVT, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, transaminitis, and hypothyroidism. The patient's goals of care are being discussed with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to GBS pneumonia and possible generalized HSV infection. The current barriers to extubation include altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, bilateral pleural effusion, and pneumonia which is improving.
2. Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his pneumonia. Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is less likely.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient continues to have an anion gap, likely"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer treatment. He was admitted to the hospital due to a diffuse rash and subsequently developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure, leading to intubation and transfer to the ICU.

The patient has been diagnosed with GBS pneumonia and HSV infection. His current condition is characterized by persistent respiratory failure, shock, metabolic acidosis (AG acidosis), and altered mental status (AMS). The patient's medical history also includes thrombocytopenia, impaired skin integrity, hypernatremia, renal failure, and supra ventricular tachycardia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is severely compromised, which puts him at risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. This may require continuous monitoring and intervention, such as adjustments in ventilator settings or consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

2. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to vital organs. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and timely administration of appropriate fluids and vasopressors are crucial in managing this complication.

3. Metabolic acidosis (AG acidosis): The patient's blood pH is low, indicating metabolic acidosis. This condition can be caused by various factors, including inadequate oxygenation, sepsis, or renal dysfunction"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who has been hospitalized at OSH for a probable drug rash. He developed acute respiratory failure and sepsis, prompting his transfer to the ICU.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation to support his breathing, with adequate oxygenation but requiring a high respiratory rate to ventilate.

2. Shock: The patient continues to require vasopressor support to maintain his blood pressure.

3. Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which was temporarily treated with bicarbonate infusion.

4. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's mental status has been altered, possibly due to sedative medications. However, he is now off sedatives for 4-5 days with little change.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis. Renal function is slowly improving, and nephrotoxins should be avoided.

6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level has decreased to 21%, indicating anemia. It is recommended to transfuse one unit of blood.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/33 to 122/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:  In the context of GBS pneumonia.  Patient has
   been treated with penicillin G and clinda, and his pneumonia is
   improving on imaging.  This respiratory failure could potentially be
   secondary to generalized HSV infection, the HSV DFA and culture from
   mini-BAL are pending. The current barriers to extubation include
   altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, bilateral pleural
   effusion, and pneumonia which is improving.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o
   CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Pt has HSV
   infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip).
   - on  AC currently, has increased work of breathing; Rule out autopeep
   - trial of Pressure Support in order to decrease his work of breathing
   - continue day 10 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the
   drug of choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours
   (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - continue day 12 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - continue day 8 of doxy for possible tick borne illness (day1: [**8-8**]);
   if no RMSF,  will d/c doxy
   - given bicarb (150meq in 1000cc D5W) x1 yesterday, re-check lytes in
   the pm and see if metabolic acidosis improves. If it did, consider
   giving another dose of bicarb
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   - intubated x2 wks
 discuss Goals of Care for tomorrow
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.  Continues to remain remain
   pressors-dependent on vasopressin and levophed.  UA was negative. Blood
   culture has been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No
   evidence of sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia
   Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster
   Antibody, IgM
   - wean down pressors as pt has evidence of digital ischemia now. Goal
   MAP 55 (given his very low diastolic), although it would still be ideal
   to get his MAP to 55 to adequately perfuse his brain for improvement in
   mental status
   - with ongoing pleural effusions and nl CVP, would attempt to maintain
   MAP with pressors rather than IVF
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give bicarb today, increase RR from 18 to 26  when giving bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**]. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis. derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction:
   consider drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome
   cannot be exluded. Less likely HSV [**Hospital1 5286**], but it it not completely
   impossible.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Exam revealed some stereotypical decorticate
   reflexes. Unclear whether it is HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**]
   sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain (goal
   MAP 65 but it may not be a realistic goal as the diastolic pressure has
   been very low). For now, maintain goal MAP at least 55 with IVF first,
   if still low then up the pressors. Hoping bicarb will help with
   acidosis and decrease pressor requirements and help with blood
   pressure.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - transfuse one unit prbcs today cautiously given volume status
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued
   -continue to monitor
   -PM lytes
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family
   - will need to watch this weekend, and see if he improves
   - will need to discuss tracheostomy early next week, patient will have
   been intubated for 2 weeks on Monday

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with GBS pneumonia and sepsis, as well as multiorgan failure including renal failure, respiratory failure, shock, and acidosis. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, altered mental status, anemia, hyponatremia, and a history of SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to GBS pneumonia. Continuing treatment with penicillin G and clindamycin to inhibit toxin production is recommended.
2. Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his pneumonia. Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is less likely. Treating the underlying pneumonia and continuing penicillin G and clindamycin are advised.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient continues to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis. Administering bicarbonate and adjusting the ventilator settings may help improve the condition.

   increase on Left since yesterday, bilateral pleural effusions, possible
   Left hilar infiltrate not significantly changed since yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:   Has GBS pneumonia, being treated with
   penicillin G and clindamycin; pneumonia appeared to be improving on
   imaging last week but worsening again.  Possibly has component of
   generalized HSV infection-- HSV DFA and culture from mini-BAL are
   pending. The current barriers to extubation include altered mental
   status, severe metabolic acidosis, infection, hemodynamic instability.
   TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at
   risk for COPD.  Pt has HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and
   lip).
   - on  AC currently, has increased work of breathing; Rule out autopeep
   - trial of Pressure Support in order to decrease his work of breathing
   - continue day 11 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (for
   GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]),
   - continue clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit
   toxin production
   - continue day 13 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - continue day 9 of doxy for possible tick borne illness (day1: [**8-8**]);
   if RMSF Neg,  will d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   - intubated x2 wks
 discuss Goals of Care for tomorrow
   .
   #) Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.  Continues on pressors--
   vasopressin and norepinephrine.  UA was negative. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so no need for CT sinus at this time.  Consider Toxic Shock
   Syndrome, given desquamating [**Month/Year (2) 5286**]
   - continue pressors, but titrate pressors to Urine output >30ccs/hr,
   independent of MAP; continue to monitor MAP
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia
   Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster
   Antibody, IgM
   - because of pleural effusions and normal CVP, electing to maintain MAP
   with pressors rather than IVF
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have acidosis, but appears to be
   more non-gap.  Was given bicarb previously, but bicarb is increasing
   his sodium intake, which is increasing his volume
   - d/c bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome.  Has new hemorrhagic bulla on hand, possibly
   indicating progression of the desquamating skin process.  Per derm,
   cefepime was d/c
d due to possibility of drug [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**] being the etiology
   of skin process.  Per derm, this is either GBS, generalized pustulosis
   (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of psoriasis. derm path from
   [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider drug-induced or viral
   etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome cannot be exluded. Less likely HSV
   [**Hospital1 5286**], but it it not completely impossible.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Had some stereotypical decorticate reflexes
   yesterday. Possibility of HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**] sedation
   and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain, but
   will titrate pressors to urine output >30ccs/hr.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**] and 1 unit pRBCs [**8-15**].
   On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac
   positive, anemia of chronic disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR
   infiltrate. Fe studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation.
   B12 and folate are normal. Patient also has renal failure which also
   contributes to his anemia.
   - repeat coags and get DIC labs
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued.  Hyponatremia 133 from
   yesterday improved to 137 yesterday evening and 136 this morning.
   -continue to monitor
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family
   - will need to watch this weekend, and see if he improves
   - will need to discuss tracheostomy early next week, patient will have
   been intubated for 2 weeks on Monday

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with GBS pneumonia and sepsis, as well as multiorgan failure (renal failure, respiratory failure, shock, acidosis). The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has GBS pneumonia, which is being treated with penicillin G and clindamycin. However, the pneumonia appears to be worsening again, and there is a possibility of a generalized HSV infection. The current barriers to extubation include altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, infection, and hemodynamic instability.

2. Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his pneumonia. Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but less likely. The patient continues on pressors (vasopressin and norepinephrine) to maintain blood pressure, and blood cultures have been negative.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient continues to have acidosis, more non-gap in nature. Bicarb was previously given but has been discontinued due to increasing sodium intake and volume.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have slowly improved, suggesting possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension during sepsis. Supportive measures include aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution (LR) and renal dosing"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:   Has GBS pneumonia, being treated with
   penicillin G and clindamycin; pneumonia appeared to be improving on
   imaging last week but worsening again.  Possibly has component of
   generalized HSV infection-- HSV DFA and culture from mini-BAL are
   pending. The current barriers to extubation include altered mental
   status, severe metabolic acidosis, infection, hemodynamic instability.
   TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at
   risk for COPD.  Pt has HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and
   lip).
   - on  AC currently, has increased work of breathing; Rule out autopeep
   - trial of Pressure Support in order to decrease his work of breathing
   - continue day 11 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (for
   GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]),
   - continue clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit
   toxin production
   - continue day 13 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - continue day 9 of doxy for possible tick borne illness (day1: [**8-8**]);
   if RMSF Neg,  will d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   - intubated x2 wks
 discuss Goals of Care for tomorrow
   .
   #) Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.  Continues on pressors--
   vasopressin and norepinephrine.  UA was negative. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so no need for CT sinus at this time.  Consider Toxic Shock
   Syndrome, given desquamating [**Month/Year (2) 5286**]
   - continue pressors, but titrate pressors to Urine output >30ccs/hr,
   independent of MAP; continue to monitor MAP
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia
   Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster
   Antibody, IgM
   - because of pleural effusions and normal CVP, electing to maintain MAP
   with pressors rather than IVF
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have acidosis, but appears to be
   more non-gap.  Was given bicarb previously, but bicarb is increasing
   his sodium intake, which is increasing his volume
   - d/c bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome.  Has new hemorrhagic bulla on hand, possibly
   indicating progression of the desquamating skin process.  Per derm,
   cefepime was d/c
d due to possibility of drug [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**] being the etiology
   of skin process.  Per derm, this is either GBS, generalized pustulosis
   (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of psoriasis. derm path from
   [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider drug-induced or viral
   etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome cannot be exluded. Less likely HSV
   [**Hospital1 5286**], but it it not completely impossible.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Had some stereotypical decorticate reflexes
   yesterday. Possibility of HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**] sedation
   and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain, but
   will titrate pressors to urine output >30ccs/hr.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**] and 1 unit pRBCs [**8-15**].
   On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac
   positive, anemia of chronic disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR
   infiltrate. Fe studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation.
   B12 and folate are normal. Patient also has renal failure which also
   contributes to his anemia.
   - repeat coags and get DIC labs
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued.  Hyponatremia 133 from
   yesterday improved to 137 yesterday evening and 136 this morning.
   -continue to monitor
   #) SVT:  pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT with no
   recent episodes in last 3 days.  Pt was hemodynamically unstable, SBP
   in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. Differential for etiology
   of SVT includes infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a
   beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - in setting of levophed restart, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family and set up time for family meeting tomorrow
   - pt intubated x 2 weeks -- will need to discuss tracheostomy option
   with family in addition to goals of care and possible withdrawal of
   care

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with GBS pneumonia and sepsis, as well as multiorgan failure involving the kidneys, heart, and lungs. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has GBS pneumonia, which is being treated with penicillin G and clindamycin. There is a possibility of generalized HSV infection, as indicated by the pending results of HSV DFA and culture from mini-BAL.

2. Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary due to pneumonia. Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but less likely.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient continues to have acidosis, which appears to be non-gap. Bicarb has been discontinued due to its increasing sodium intake, and LR (lactated Ringer's solution) is being used instead of NS (normal saline) for IV fluids.

4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are slowly improving, indicating a possible recovery from renal failure, which may be due to hypotension from sepsis.

5. Altered mental status: The patient has been experiencing some stereotypical decorticate reflexes and has a possibility of HSV encephalitis. CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process, and an MRI has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:  In the context of GBS pneumonia.  Patient has
   been treated with penicillin G and clinda, and his pneumonia is
   improving on imaging.  This respiratory failure could potentially be
   secondary to generalized HSV infection, the HSV DFA and culture from
   mini-BAL are pending. The current barriers to extubation include
   altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, bilateral pleural
   effusion, and pneumonia which is improving.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o
   CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Pt has HSV
   infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip).
   - on  AC currently, has increased work of breathing; Rule out autopeep
   - trial of Pressure Support in order to decrease his work of breathing
   - continue day 10 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the
   drug of choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours
   (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - continue day 12 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - continue day 8 of doxy for possible tick borne illness (day1: [**8-8**]);
   if no RMSF,  will d/c doxy
   - given bicarb (150meq in 1000cc D5W) x1 yesterday, re-check lytes in
   the pm and see if metabolic acidosis improves. If it did, consider
   giving another dose of bicarb
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   - intubated x2 wks
 discuss Goals of Care for tomorrow
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.  Continues to remain remain
   pressors-dependent on vasopressin and levophed.  UA was negative. Blood
   culture has been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No
   evidence of sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia
   Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster
   Antibody, IgM
   - wean down pressors as pt has evidence of digital ischemia now. Goal
   MAP 55 (given his very low diastolic), although it would still be ideal
   to get his MAP to 55 to adequately perfuse his brain for improvement in
   mental status
   - with ongoing pleural effusions and nl CVP, would attempt to maintain
   MAP with pressors rather than IVF
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give bicarb today, increase RR from 18 to 26  when giving bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**]. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis. derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction:
   consider drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome
   cannot be exluded. Less likely HSV [**Hospital1 5286**], but it it not completely
   impossible.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Exam revealed some stereotypical decorticate
   reflexes. Unclear whether it is HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**]
   sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain (goal
   MAP 65 but it may not be a realistic goal as the diastolic pressure has
   been very low). For now, maintain goal MAP at least 55 with IVF first,
   if still low then up the pressors. Hoping bicarb will help with
   acidosis and decrease pressor requirements and help with blood
   pressure.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - transfuse one unit prbcs today cautiously given volume status
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued
   -continue to monitor
   -PM lytes
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating rash, GBS pneumonia, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. The patient has been treated with penicillin G and clindamycin for GBS pneumonia, and acyclovir for HSV infection. He is currently on vasopressin and norepinephrine for hypotension, and has been intubated for 10 days. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, altered mental status, anemia, hyponatremia, and a history of SVT. The goals of care include treating underlying pneumonia, continuing antibiotics and antivirals, weaning down pressors, managing metabolic acidosis, supporting renal function, addressing altered mental status, managing anemia, and monitoring electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to GBS pneumonia, and there is improvement in imaging. However, barriers to extubation include altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, bilateral pleural effusion, and pneumonia. These factors need to be addressed to consider weaning off mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his pneumonia. Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is less likely. Treatment includes continuing antibiotics and ant"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:   Has GBS pneumonia, being treated with
   penicillin G and clindamycin; pneumonia appeared to be improving on
   imaging last week but worsening again.  Possibly has component of
   generalized HSV infection-- HSV DFA and culture from mini-BAL are
   pending. The current barriers to extubation include altered mental
   status, severe metabolic acidosis, infection, hemodynamic instability.
   TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at
   risk for COPD.  Pt has HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and
   lip).
   - on  AC currently, has increased work of breathing; Rule out autopeep
   - trial of Pressure Support in order to decrease his work of breathing
   - continue day 11 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (for
   GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]),
   - continue clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit
   toxin production
   - continue day 13 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - continue day 9 of doxy for possible tick borne illness (day1: [**8-8**]);
   if RMSF Neg,  will d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   - intubated x2 wks
 discuss Goals of Care for tomorrow
   .
   #) Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.  Continues on pressors--
   vasopressin and norepinephrine.  UA was negative. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so no need for CT sinus at this time.  Consider Toxic Shock
   Syndrome, given desquamating [**Month/Year (2) 5286**]
   - continue pressors, but titrate pressors to Urine output >30ccs/hr,
   independent of MAP; continue to monitor MAP
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia
   Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster
   Antibody, IgM
   - because of pleural effusions and normal CVP, electing to maintain MAP
   with pressors rather than IVF
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have acidosis, but appears to be
   more non-gap.  Was given bicarb previously, but bicarb is increasing
   his sodium intake, which is increasing his volume
   - d/c bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome.  Has new hemorrhagic bulla on hand, possibly
   indicating progression of the desquamating skin process.  Per derm,
   cefepime was d/c
d due to possibility of drug [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**] being the etiology
   of skin process.  Per derm, this is either GBS, generalized pustulosis
   (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of psoriasis. derm path from
   [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider drug-induced or viral
   etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome cannot be exluded. Less likely HSV
   [**Hospital1 5286**], but it it not completely impossible.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Had some stereotypical decorticate reflexes
   yesterday. Possibility of HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**] sedation
   and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain, but
   will titrate pressors to urine output >30ccs/hr.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**] and 1 unit pRBCs [**8-15**].
   On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac
   positive, anemia of chronic disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR
   infiltrate. Fe studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation.
   B12 and folate are normal. Patient also has renal failure which also
   contributes to his anemia.
   - repeat coags and get DIC labs
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued.  Hyponatremia 133 from
   yesterday improved to 137 yesterday evening and 136 this morning.
   -continue to monitor
   #) SVT:  pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT with no
   recent episodes in last 3 days.  Pt was hemodynamically unstable, SBP
   in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. Differential for etiology
   of SVT includes infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a
   beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - in setting of levophed restart, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family and set up time for family meeting tomorrow
   - pt intubated x 2 weeks -- will need to discuss tracheostomy option
   with family in addition to goals of care and possible withdrawal of
   care

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating skin, GBS pneumonia, sepsis, and multiorgan failure (renal failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis). He has been treated with penicillin G and clindamycin for GBS pneumonia, acyclovir for HSV infection, and doxycycline for possible tick-borne illness. The patient continues to have metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, anemia, hyponatremia, SVT, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, transaminitis, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has GBS pneumonia, which is being treated with penicillin G and clindamycin. The worsening of pneumonia on imaging indicates a potential complication.
2. Infection: The patient has sepsis and multiorgan failure, suggesting a systemic infection. The source of infection is likely pulmonary due to GBS pneumonia. There is also a possibility of generalized HSV infection.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient continues to have non-gap metabolic acidosis. The cause may be sepsis, renal failure, or other factors.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:  In the context of GBS pneumonia.  Patient has
   been treated with penicillin G and clinda, and his pneumonia is
   improving on imaging.  This respiratory failure could potentially be
   secondary to generalized HSV infection, the HSV DFA and culture from
   mini-BAL are pending. The current barriers to extubation include
   altered mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, bilateral pleural
   effusion, and pneumonia which is improving.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o
   CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.  Pt has HSV
   infection from two sources (nasopharynx and lip).
   - on  AC currently, RR increased from 18 to 26 in an attempt to blow
   off CO2 when he is being given bicarb
   - continue day 10 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (the
   drug of choice for GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours
   (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit toxin production
   - continue day 12 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - continue day 8 of doxy for possible tick borne illness (day1: [**8-8**]);
   if no RMSF,  will d/c doxy
   - given bicarb (150meq in 1000cc D5W) x1 yesterday, re-check lytes in
   the pm and see if metabolic acidosis improves. If it did, consider
   giving another dose of bicarb
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   .
   #) sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.  Continues to remain remain
   pressors-dependent on vasopressin and levophed.  UA was negative. Blood
   culture has been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No
   evidence of sinusitis, so wouldn
t get at CT sinus at this point.
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (the drug of choice for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to
   inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia
   Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster
   Antibody, IgM
   - wean down pressors as pt has evidence of digital ischemia now. Goal
   MAP 55 (given his very low diastolic), although it would still be ideal
   to get his MAP to 55 to adequately perfuse his brain for improvement in
   mental status
   - with ongoing pleural effusions and nl CVP, would attempt to maintain
   MAP with pressors rather than IVF
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have an anion gap, likely due to
   renal failure and lactic acidosis. Non-anion gap acidosis significantly
   improved.
   - give bicarb today, increase RR from 18 to 26  when giving bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome. Per derm, cefepime was d/c
d as possibly
   contributing to the worsening skin [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**]. Per derm, this is either GBS,
   generalized pustulosis (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of
   psoriasis. derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction:
   consider drug-induced or viral etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome
   cannot be exluded. Less likely HSV [**Hospital1 5286**], but it it not completely
   impossible.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Exam revealed some stereotypical decorticate
   reflexes. Unclear whether it is HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**]
   sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain (goal
   MAP 65 but it may not be a realistic goal as the diastolic pressure has
   been very low). For now, maintain goal MAP at least 55 with IVF first,
   if still low then up the pressors. Hoping bicarb will help with
   acidosis and decrease pressor requirements and help with blood
   pressure.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**]. On admission Hct was
   31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac positive, anemia of chronic
   disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR infiltrate. Fe studies revealed
   anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate are normal. No
   evidence of hemolysis or DIC at this point. Patient also has renal
   failure which also contributes to his anemia.
   - transfuse one unit prbcs today cautiously given volume status
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued
   -continue to monitor
   -PM lytes
   #) SVT: didn
t have another episode during the past 48 hours. pt was
   found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT. Pt was hemodynamically
   unstable, SBP in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. In terms of
   etiologies of SVT, it is likely secondary to infection, volume
   depletion and levophed which is a beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - now that levophed restarted, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: now resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family
   - will need to watch this weekend, and see if he improves
   - will need to discuss tracheostomy early next week, patient will have
   been intubated for 2 weeks on Monday

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, currently admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating rash, GBS pneumonia, sepsis, multiorgan failure (renal failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis), and HSV infection. The patient is pressor-dependent on vasopressin and levophed, with ongoing pleural effusions and normal CVP. The patient's mental status is altered, and there is evidence of digital ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been treated for GBS pneumonia, but still has bilateral pleural effusion and pneumonia which is improving. There is a risk of ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's source of infection is likely pulmonary given his pneumonia. Generalized HSV infection is another possibility. The patient remains pressor-dependent, indicating ongoing sepsis.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient continues to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to renal failure and lactic acidosis.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has an improving creatinine level, indicating possible recovery from renal failure. However, the patient is still on renal replacement therapy and requires careful fluid management.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to HSV encephalitis, sedation, or prolonged sepsis. Further evaluation is needed, including a CT head"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:   Has GBS pneumonia, being treated with
   penicillin G and clindamycin; pneumonia appeared to be improving on
   imaging last week but worsening again.  Possibly has component of

   recent episodes in last 3 days.  Pt was hemodynamically unstable, SBP
   in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. Differential for etiology
   of SVT includes infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a
   beta1 agonist.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating skin lesions, GBS pneumonia, and sepsis. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis, multiorgan failure (renal failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis), HSV infection, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and anemia. The patient has undergone various interventions and treatments, including antibiotics, antiviral medication, and pressors to maintain blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Prolonged intubation: The patient has been intubated for two weeks and may require a tracheostomy to facilitate weaning off mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing new infections due to prolonged immobility, use of indwelling lines, and immunosuppression from sepsis and medications.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and further deterioration can lead to the need for dialysis.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient continues to have acidosis, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and there is a possibility of HSV encephalitis. Further evaluation, such as a lumbar puncture, may be necessary.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:   Has GBS pneumonia, being treated with
   penicillin G and clindamycin; pneumonia appeared to be improving on
   imaging last week but worsening again.  Possibly has component of
   generalized HSV infection-- HSV DFA and culture from mini-BAL are
   pending. The current barriers to extubation include altered mental
   status, severe metabolic acidosis, infection, hemodynamic instability.
   TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's smoking history puts him at
   risk for COPD.  Pt has HSV infection from two sources (nasopharynx and
   lip).
   - on  AC currently, has increased work of breathing; Rule out autopeep
   - trial of Pressure Support in order to decrease his work of breathing
   - continue day 11 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (for
   GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]),
   - continue clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit
   toxin production
   - continue day 13 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - continue day 9 of doxy for possible tick borne illness (day1: [**8-8**]);
   if RMSF Neg,  will d/c doxy
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   - intubated x2 wks
 discuss Goals of Care for tomorrow
   .
   #) Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his
   pneumonia.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but is
   less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.  Continues on pressors--
   vasopressin and norepinephrine.  UA was negative. Blood culture has
   been negative, and TTE on [**8-3**] showed no vegetation. No evidence of
   sinusitis, so no need for CT sinus at this time.  Consider Toxic Shock
   Syndrome, given desquamating [**Month/Year (2) 5286**]
   - continue pressors, but titrate pressors to Urine output >30ccs/hr,
   independent of MAP; continue to monitor MAP
   - treat underlying PNA.  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel: f/u on RMSF, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia
   Antibodies, IgG and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster
   Antibody, IgM
   - because of pleural effusions and normal CVP, electing to maintain MAP
   with pressors rather than IVF
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: pt continues to have acidosis, but appears to be
   more non-gap.  Was given bicarb previously, but bicarb is increasing
   his sodium intake, which is increasing his volume
   - d/c bicarb
   - give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely [**12-21**] ATN from
   hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome.  Has new hemorrhagic bulla on hand, possibly
   indicating progression of the desquamating skin process.  Per derm,
   cefepime was d/c
d due to possibility of drug [**First Name3 (LF) 5286**] being the etiology
   of skin process.  Per derm, this is either GBS, generalized pustulosis
   (benign drug reaction) or perhaps flare of psoriasis. derm path from
   [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider drug-induced or viral
   etiology.  Paraneoplastic syndrome cannot be exluded. Less likely HSV
   [**Hospital1 5286**], but it it not completely impossible.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Had some stereotypical decorticate reflexes
   yesterday. Possibility of HSV encephalitis. Also likely [**12-21**] sedation
   and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - hold off on MRI for now
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain, but
   will titrate pressors to urine output >30ccs/hr.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**] and 1 unit pRBCs [**8-15**].
   On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was guaiac
   positive, anemia of chronic disease / inflammation or DAH given CXR
   infiltrate. Fe studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation.
   B12 and folate are normal. Patient also has renal failure which also
   contributes to his anemia.
   - repeat coags and get DIC labs
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor, goal Hct 21. Transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued.  Hyponatremia 133 from
   yesterday improved to 137 yesterday evening and 136 this morning.
   -continue to monitor
   #) SVT:  pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT with no
   recent episodes in last 3 days.  Pt was hemodynamically unstable, SBP
   in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. Differential for etiology
   of SVT includes infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a
   beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - in setting of levophed restart, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unsure
   if he really has hypothyrodism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not
   check thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - family meeting today
   - pt intubated x 2 weeks -- will need to discuss tracheostomy option
   with family in addition to goals of care and possible withdrawal of
   care

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with GBS pneumonia, sepsis, multiorgan failure (renal failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis), and a possible generalized HSV infection. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has GBS pneumonia and is being treated with penicillin G and clindamycin. There is concern about worsening pneumonia despite previous improvement.

2. Sepsis: The source of infection is likely pulmonary, and there is also a possibility of generalized HSV infection.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient continues to have acidosis, which appears to be non-gap. Bicarb has been discontinued due to increasing sodium intake.

4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are slowly improving, indicating possible ATN from hypotension during sepsis. Adequate blood pressure control and aggressive fluid resuscitation are recommended.

5. Skin condition: The patient has a desquamating skin process, which could be related to toxic shock syndrome or a drug reaction. Clindamycin is being given to inhibit toxin production, and acyclovir is being continued for HSV infection.

6. Altered mental status: The patient has had stereotypical decorticate reflexes and is likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:   Has GBS pneumonia, being treated with
   penicillin G and clindamycin.  Clinical improvement questionable.
   Possibly has component of generalized HSV infection.  The current
   barriers to extubation include altered mental status, infection,
   hemodynamic instability.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's
   smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.
   - on  AC, no longer appears to have increased work of breathing
   - continue day 12 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (for
   GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]),
   - continue clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit
   toxin production
   - continue day 14 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - Doxy D/Ced yesterday b/c RMSF negative and had completed full 8 day
   course regardless for RMSF
   - f/u remaining cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   - intubated x2 wks
 discuss Goals of Care at family meeting this
   afternoon
   .
   #) Sepsis/ Hypotension:  Secondary to GBS pneumonia and possible Toxic
   Shock Syndrome.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but
   is less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.   Has been recently on pressors
   vasopressin and norepinephrine, but was able to titrate off levophed
   late this morning.
   - continue vasopressin as needed, but titrate pressors to Urine output
   >30ccs/hr, independent of MAP; continue to monitor MAP
   - treat underlying PNA--  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel:    Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia Antibodies, IgG
   and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM
   .
   #) [**Doctor Last Name **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome.  Has new hemorrhagic bulla on hand, possibly
   indicating progression of the desquamating skin process.  Per derm,
   cefepime was d/c
d due to possibility of drug [**Doctor Last Name 5286**] being the etiology
   of skin process.  Derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity
   reaction: consider drug-induced or viral etiology.   Paraneoplastic
   syndrome cannot be exluded. Much less likely HSV [**Hospital1 5286**].
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Unclear baseline mental status. Has corneal
   and pupilary reflexes and responds to painful stimuli.  [**Month (only) 11**] have
   cerebral edema.  Possibility of HSV encephalitis. Also may be secondary
   to sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain at this
   time -- titrating pressors to urine output >30ccs/hr.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis:  pt continues to have acidosis, but appears to
   be more non-gap.
   - if patient were to need fluids, give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely secondary to ATN
   from hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR as needed
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct 20.1 today . Had received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**] and 1 unit
   pRBCs [**8-15**]. On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was
   guaiac positive, anemia of chronic disease.  Does not likely have DAH,
   though it is still on differential in setting of CXR infiltrate. Fe
   studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate
   are normal. Patient also has renal failure which also contributes to
   his anemia.  Repeat coags and DIC Labs normal except for elevated
   D-dimer which is very non-specific.
   - Hold on transfusion of 1u pRBCs until after family meeting to discuss
   goals of care
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued.  Hyponatremia 133 from
   two days ago improved to 136 yesterday and 142 today.
   -continue to monitor
   #) SVT:  pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT with no
   recent episodes in last 3 days.  Pt was hemodynamically unstable, SBP
   in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. Differential for etiology
   of SVT includes infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a
   beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - in setting of levophed restart, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unclear
   if actual hypothyrodism vs. sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not check
   thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - family meeting today
   - pt intubated x 2 weeks -- will need to discuss tracheostomy option
   with family in addition to goals of care and possible withdrawal of
   care

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, who was transferred to the ICU with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating syndrome, GBS pneumonia, sepsis, and multiorgan failure (renal failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis/hypotension, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, anemia, hyponatremia, SVT, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, transaminitis, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has GBS pneumonia, being treated with penicillin G and clindamycin. Clinical improvement is questionable. The current barriers to extubation include altered mental status, infection, and hemodynamic instability.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:   Has GBS pneumonia, being treated with
   penicillin G and clindamycin.  Clinical improvement questionable.
   Possibly has component of generalized HSV infection.  The current
   barriers to extubation include altered mental status, infection,
   hemodynamic instability.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's
   smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.
   - on  AC, no longer appears to have increased work of breathing
   - continue day 12 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (for
   GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]),
   - continue clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit
   toxin production
   - continue day 14 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - Doxy D/Ced yesterday b/c RMSF negative and had completed full 8 day
   course regardless for RMSF
   - f/u remaining cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   - intubated x2 wks
 discuss Goals of Care at family meeting this
   afternoon
   .
   #) Sepsis/ Hypotension:  Secondary to GBS pneumonia and possible Toxic
   Shock Syndrome.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but
   is less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.   Has been recently on pressors
   vasopressin and norepinephrine, but was able to titrate off levophed
   late this morning.
   - continue vasopressin as needed, but titrate pressors to Urine output
   >30ccs/hr, independent of MAP; continue to monitor MAP
   - treat underlying PNA--  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel:    Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia Antibodies, IgG
   and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM
   .
   #) [**Doctor Last Name **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome.  Has new hemorrhagic bulla on hand, possibly
   indicating progression of the desquamating skin process.  Per derm,
   cefepime was d/c
d due to possibility of drug [**Doctor Last Name 5286**] being the etiology
   of skin process.  Derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity
   reaction: consider drug-induced or viral etiology.   Paraneoplastic
   syndrome cannot be exluded. Much less likely HSV [**Hospital1 5286**].
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Unclear baseline mental status. Has corneal
   and pupilary reflexes and responds to painful stimuli.  [**Month (only) 11**] have
   cerebral edema.  Possibility of HSV encephalitis. Also may be secondary
   to sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain at this
   time -- titrating pressors to urine output >30ccs/hr.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis:  pt continues to have acidosis, but appears to
   be more non-gap.
   - if patient were to need fluids, give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely secondary to ATN
   from hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR as needed
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct 20.1 today . Had received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**] and 1 unit
   pRBCs [**8-15**]. On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was
   guaiac positive, anemia of chronic disease.  Does not likely have DAH,
   though it is still on differential in setting of CXR infiltrate. Fe
   studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate
   are normal. Patient also has renal failure which also contributes to
   his anemia.  Repeat coags and DIC Labs normal except for elevated
   D-dimer which is very non-specific.
   - Hold on transfusion of 1u pRBCs until after family meeting to discuss
   goals of care
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued.  Hyponatremia 133 from
   two days ago improved to 136 yesterday and 142 today.
   -continue to monitor
   #) SVT:  pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT with no
   recent episodes in last 3 days.  Pt was hemodynamically unstable, SBP
   in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. Differential for etiology
   of SVT includes infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a
   beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - in setting of levophed restart, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unclear
   if actual hypothyrodism vs. sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not check
   thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - family meeting today
   - pt intubated x 2 weeks -- will need to discuss tracheostomy option
   with family in addition to goals of care and possible withdrawal of
   care

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Respiratory failure:   Has GBS pneumonia, being treated with
   penicillin G and clindamycin.  Clinical improvement questionable.
   Possibly has component of generalized HSV infection.  The current
   barriers to extubation include altered mental status, infection,
   hemodynamic instability.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF. Patient's
   smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.
   - on  AC, no longer appears to have increased work of breathing
   - continue day 12 of penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8 hours (for
   GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]),
   - continue clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit
   toxin production
   - continue day 14 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - Doxy D/Ced yesterday b/c RMSF negative and had completed full 8 day
   course regardless for RMSF
   - f/u remaining cultures
   - f/u on ID recs
   - intubated x2 wks
 discuss Goals of Care at family meeting this
   afternoon
   .
   #) Sepsis/ Hypotension:  Secondary to GBS pneumonia and possible Toxic
   Shock Syndrome.   Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but
   is less likely.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim was normal.   Has been recently on pressors
   vasopressin and norepinephrine, but was able to titrate off levophed
   late this morning.
   - continue vasopressin as needed, but titrate pressors to Urine output
   >30ccs/hr, independent of MAP; continue to monitor MAP
   - treat underlying PNA--  continue penicillin G 4 million units IV q 8
   hours (for GBS), clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours to inhibit toxin
   production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   - f/u cultures and other infectious panel:    Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   (human granulocytic Ehrlichia [**Doctor Last Name 23**]) IgG/IgM; Babesia Antibodies, IgG
   and IgM; Parvovirus B19 Antibodies; Varicella zoster Antibody, IgM
   .
   #) [**Doctor Last Name **]: OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis, however, given
   pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether it is related
   to toxic shock syndrome.  Has new hemorrhagic bulla on hand, possibly
   indicating progression of the desquamating skin process.  Per derm,
   cefepime was d/c
d due to possibility of drug [**Doctor Last Name 5286**] being the etiology
   of skin process.  Derm path from [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity
   reaction: consider drug-induced or viral etiology.   Paraneoplastic
   syndrome cannot be exluded. Much less likely HSV [**Hospital1 5286**].
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)
   - f/u any new derm recs
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Unclear baseline mental status. Has corneal
   and pupilary reflexes and responds to painful stimuli.  [**Month (only) 11**] have
   cerebral edema.  Possibility of HSV encephalitis. Also may be secondary
   to sedation and prolonged sepsis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - consider LP after clarification of goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain at this
   time -- titrating pressors to urine output >30ccs/hr.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis:  pt continues to have acidosis, but appears to
   be more non-gap.
   - if patient were to need fluids, give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely secondary to ATN
   from hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR as needed
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct 20.1 today . Had received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**] and 1 unit
   pRBCs [**8-15**]. On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was
   guaiac positive, anemia of chronic disease.  Does not likely have DAH,
   though it is still on differential in setting of CXR infiltrate. Fe
   studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate
   are normal. Patient also has renal failure which also contributes to
   his anemia.  Repeat coags and DIC Labs normal except for elevated
   D-dimer which is very non-specific.
   - Hold on transfusion of 1u pRBCs until after family meeting to discuss
   goals of care
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued.  Hyponatremia 133 from
   two days ago improved to 136 yesterday and 142 today.
   -continue to monitor
   #) SVT:  pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT with no
   recent episodes in last 3 days.  Pt was hemodynamically unstable, SBP
   in the 70s to 80s despite being on levophed. Differential for etiology
   of SVT includes infection, volume depletion and levophed which is a
   beta1 agonist.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - in setting of levophed restart, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unclear
   if actual hypothyrodism vs. sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not check
   thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - family meeting today
   - pt intubated x 2 weeks -- will need to discuss tracheostomy option
   with family in addition to goals of care and possible withdrawal of
   care

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating skin, GBS pneumonia, sepsis, and multiorgan failure (renal failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis). The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis/hypotension, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, anemia, hyponatremia, SVT, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, transaminitis, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has GBS pneumonia and is being treated with penicillin G and clindamycin. There are barriers to extubation including altered mental status, infection, and hemodynamic instability.
2. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient has sepsis secondary to GBS pneumonia and possible toxic shock syndrome. Generalized HSV infection is another possibility but less likely.
3. Altered mental status: Unclear baseline mental status. Possibility of HSV encephalitis. Also may be secondary to sedation and prolonged sepsis.
4. Metabolic acidosis: Non-gap metabolic acidosis.
5. Renal failure: Most likely secondary to ATN from hypotension from sepsis.
6. Anemia: Hct 20.1 today. Had received 1u pRBC on [8"

   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)-patient is developing more
   ulcers in dependent areas
   - derm still feels that this [**Hospital1 5286**] is consistent with a drug reaction,
   but would treat through this [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Will open his eyes more but is not
   interactive or following commands. Has corneal and pupilary reflexes
   and responds to painful stimuli.  [**Month (only) 11**] have cerebral edema.  Possibility
   of HSV encephalitis.
   - CT head x2 were negative for any intracranial process.
   - no LP given current goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain at this
   time -- titrating pressors to urine output >30ccs/hr.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis:  pt continues to have acidosis, but appears to
   be more non-gap.
   - if patient were to need fluids, give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely secondary to ATN
   from hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR as needed
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct 20.1 today . Had received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**] and 1 unit
   pRBCs [**8-15**]. On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was
   guaiac positive, anemia of chronic disease.  Does not likely have DAH,
   though it is still on differential in setting of CXR infiltrate. Fe
   studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate
   are normal. Patient also has renal failure which also contributes to
   his anemia.  Repeat coags and DIC Labs normal except for elevated
   D-dimer which is very non-specific.
   - transfused 2units PRBC
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued, when he became
   hyponatremc to 133 from two days ago improved to 136 then 142 then to
   145 today.
   -since his sodiuim is creeping back up will restart free water flushes
   with tube feeds
   #) SVT:  pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT with no
   recent episodes in last 3 days.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - in setting of levophed restart, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unclear
   if actual hypothyrodism vs. sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not check
   thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - family to make final decision on Thursday, but based on report from
   family meeting, they are leaning toward withdrawing care but he has a
   large family and they would like to put his affairs in order

   control and making him comfortable vs more alert
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating rash, GBS pneumonia, sepsis, and multiorgan failure (renal failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis). The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with altered mental status. He has a confirmed diagnosis of GBS pneumonia and is being treated with penicillin G and clindamycin. The patient also has signs of generalized HSV infection. He is on pressors vasopressin and norepinephrine, but was able to titrate off levophed yesterday. The patient's goals of care will be discussed at a family meeting later in the week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has GBS pneumonia and may continue to experience respiratory difficulties, potentially requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient has sepsis secondary to GBS pneumonia and possible toxic shock syndrome. There is a risk of further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen due to sepsis, HSV encephalitis, or other causes.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient continues to have acidosis, which may be non-gap in nature. Monitoring and treatment are necessary to correct this condition.
5. Renal failure: The patient has multiorgan failure including renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease/inflammation, likely exacerbated by renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation and management are required.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient initially had hypernatremia but has been fluctuating between hyponatremia and hypernatremia. Free water flushes may be needed to manage sodium levels.
8. Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced SVT and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage any arrhythmias.
9. Transaminitis: The patient had resolved transaminitis but should be monitored for any signs of liver dysfunction.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function is unclear, and it is uncertain if the patient has actual hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid syndrome. Monitoring and further evaluation may be necessary.
11. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed skin breakdown and desquamating rash, which may progress to more severe complications if not properly managed.
12. Goals of care: The patient's family will make a final decision on further goals of care later in the week."

   [**2100-8-13**]: Bronchial Aspirate:  No HSV virus isolated so far
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old male with h/o throat cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital1 1**] with respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating [**Hospital1 5286**],
   found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis and multiorgan failure (renal
   failure/resp failure/shock/acidosis).
   #) Sepsis/ Hypotension:  Secondary to GBS pneumonia and possible Toxic
   Shock Syndrome.   Pressors vasopressin and norepinephrine continue.
   Norepinephrine had to be titrated up to keep BP and Urine output up due
   to morphine gtt.
   - continue vasopressin as needed, but titrate pressors to Urine output
   >30ccs/hr, independent of MAP; continue to monitor MAP
   - treat underlying PNA--  continue penicillin G 2 million units IV q 4
   hours (for GBS), clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir for HSV infection
   #) Respiratory failure:   Has GBS pneumonia, being treated with
   penicillin G and clindamycin.  Clinical improvement questionable,
   appears to be have been interacting more yesterday, but skin worsening
   and aspirated tube feeds last night.  The current barriers to
   extubation include altered mental status, infection, hemodynamic
   instability.  TTE showed normal EF, r/o CHF.  Patient's smoking history
   puts him at risk for COPD.
   - continues on  AC
   - continue day 13 of penicillin G 2 million units IV q 4 hours (for
   GBS) (day1: [**8-6**]),
   - continue clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours (day1: [**8-6**]) to inhibit
   toxin production
   - continue day 15 of acyclovir for HSV infection (day1: [**8-4**]), as per
   ID this presentation could represent HSV generalized infection
   - f/u remaining cultures
   .
   #) [**Month/Year (2) **]:   Skin erythematous and continues to desquamate with more
   breakdown diffusely.  Pt appears to be in significant pain when moved
   around or examined.  OSH biopsy diagnosed leukoclastic vasculitis,
   however, given pt was GBS positive in sputum culture, question whether
   it is related to toxic shock syndrome.  Has new skin breakdown in
   dependent areas, patient is unable to recover from the original insult,
   given his low albumin and clinical deterioration.  Derm path from
   [**Hospital1 **]: c/w hypersensitivity reaction: consider drug-induced or viral
   etiology.
   - on clindamycin to inhibit toxin production
   - continue acyclovir per ID
   - continue triamcinolone ointment [**Hospital1 **] for skin [**Hospital1 5286**]
   - continue Aquafor [**Hospital1 **]
    -wound care (pt also has ulcer on coccyx)-patient is developing more
   ulcers in dependent areas
   - no advil/motrin
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Will open his eyes more but is not
   interactive or following commands.  Has morphine gtt now though not on
   other sedation.  Has corneal and pupilary reflexes and responds to
   painful stimuli.  [**Month (only) 11**] have cerebral edema.  Not likely HSV
   encephalitis.
   - CT head x2 previously were negative for any intracranial process.
   - no LP given current goals of care
   - adequate blood pressure control for better perfusion of brain at this
   time -- titrating pressors to urine output >30ccs/hr.
   - continue thiamine
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis:  pt continues to have acidosis, but appears to
   be more non-gap.
   - if patient were to need fluids, give LR instead of NS if giving IVF
   .
   #) Renal Failure:  Cr slowly improving.   Most likely secondary to ATN
   from hypotension from sepsis.
   - support blood pressure for adequate perfusion of kidneys
   - as pt has lots of insensible fluid loss from skin [**Last Name (LF) 5286**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   aggressively resuscitate with LR as needed
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct 20.1 today . Had received 1u pRBC on [**8-13**] and 1 unit
   pRBCs [**8-15**]. On admission Hct was 31.4. DDx includes GIB given he was
   guaiac positive, anemia of chronic disease.  Does not likely have DAH,
   though it is still on differential in setting of CXR infiltrate. Fe
   studies revealed anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. B12 and folate
   are normal. Patient also has renal failure which also contributes to
   his anemia.  Repeat coags and DIC Labs normal except for elevated
   D-dimer which is very non-specific.
   - transfused 2units PRBC
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Patient initially had hypernatremia up to 150, s/p
   free water flushes q6h which was discontinued, when he became
   hyponatremc to 133 from two days ago improved to 136 then 142 then to
   145 today.
   -since his sodiuim is creeping back up will restart free water flushes
   with tube feeds
   #) SVT:  pt was found to be in SVT, most likely AVNRT or AVNT with no
   recent episodes in last 3 days.
   - per family, cardiovert if pt goes back into SVT with hemodynamic
   instability
   - in setting of levophed restart, need to monitor
   .
   #) Afib with RVR: resolved. was in SVT (AVRT or AVNRT), s/p
   cardioversion
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #) Transaminitis: Resolved, liver synthetic function good.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: pt was started on levothyroxine at OSH, but unclear
   if actual hypothyrodism vs. sick euthyroid syndrome. Would not check
   thyroid function at this time as pt is acutely ill in ICU.
   - levothyroxine was discontinued in the setting of SVT
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - family to make final decision on Thursday, but based on report from
   family meeting, they are leaning toward withdrawing care but he has a
   large family and they would like to put his affairs in order

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer, currently admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He was transferred from another hospital and found to have GBS pneumonia and sepsis, along with multiorgan failure (renal failure, respiratory failure, shock, acidosis). The patient is now experiencing skin breakdown, pain, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, anemia, hypernatremia, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's underlying GBS pneumonia and possible toxic shock syndrome may continue to cause hypotension and sepsis. Pressors (vasopressin and norepinephrine) will be continued, titrated to maintain blood pressure and urine output, while monitoring for any signs of organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has GBS pneumonia and is being treated with penicillin G and clindamycin. Clinical improvement is questionable, and the current barriers to extubation include altered mental status, infection, and hemodynamic instability. The patient's smoking history puts him at risk for COPD.
3. Skin Erythema and Desquamation: The patient's skin remains erythematous and continues to desquamate with more breakdown, particularly in dependent areas. This could be related to toxic shock syndrome or a hypersensitivity reaction.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, diffuse desquamating rash, GBS pneumonia, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition remains critical with unstable vital signs, including hypotension and respiratory distress. He is also experiencing toxic shock syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by widespread infection and inflammation. If not managed promptly and effectively, sepsis can progress to septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and ultimately death.
3. Toxic Shock Syndrome: The patient is showing signs of toxic shock syndrome, a rare and potentially fatal condition caused by bacterial toxins. This syndrome can lead to severe organ damage and failure if not treated promptly.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is already experiencing renal failure, which means his kidneys are not functioning properly. This can result in the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances, further compromising his overall health.
5. Multiorgan Failure: Given the presence of multiorgan failure involving the respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular systems, there is a risk of additional organs failing, such as the liver"
