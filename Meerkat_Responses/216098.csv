   CXR this AM pending
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents  with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient also with AFib with RVR causing hypotension. Also with mild
   troponin increase of 0.12 (peaked at 0.27 in OSH), ischemic changes on
   EKG (TWI) : Sent for cath and found 2 vessel disease, s/p BMS to LAD.
   .
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: found to have 2 vessel disease on cardiac cath.
   s/p BMS to the mid LAD. ? whether this was a primary coronary event or
   demand [**1-28**] RVR as pt. had acute heart failure yesterday and still has
   not significantly increased her troponin, would have expected large
   bump by now if infarct large enough to cause LV failure. EKG does
   appear to be c/w s/p anterior infarct.
   -Integrillin gtt until 18 hours post cath (stop at 1100)
   -Plavix 75 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Start Aspirin desensitisation protocal
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   - Start metroprolol low dose later today.
   -Hold ACE for now, given her hypotension and dye in cath
   - TTE in am to check for WMA
   .
   # PUMP: Noted to have EF of 60-70% on [**5-27**]. Current BNP elevated to
   [**Numeric Identifier 8933**].  Fluid overload possibly secondary afib with RVR; this is likely
   the etiology behind her flash pulmonary edema.
   -Will hold diuresis as patient is hypotensive and on Phenylephrine
   -Once stable, will consider diuresing
   -FU TTE today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with h/o afib with RVR, presents to unit in afib with
   RVR and hemodynamically unstable.
   -Dilt gtt started, bolus of 20 mg with infusion of [**5-15**] mg/hr as
   tolerated maintain HR < 110;
   - Since patient has a DDD pacemaker, will give as much nodal agents as
   needed for RVR, as patient will be paced out of bradycardia.
   - Neo gtt to maintain MAP > 60
   - Start low dose metroprolol later today after ASA desensitization.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR elevated to 2.3; continue home dose of coumadin as patient is at
   goal, but will hold heparin gtt.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF
   -intubated on AC; Will attempt PS today and ultimately wean from vent
   when HD stable; RISBI overnight was 29
   - Check ABG's in AM
   - Start Lasix 20 mg IV, FU I/Os adjust as needed.
   - CXR in AM
   -  Attempt extubation today.
   # Respiratory Acidosis with Metabolic Compensation: Patient h/o COPD on
   home oxygen secondary to sarcoidosis. Acid/Base disturbance likely
   secondary to COPD, as patient may be a CO2 retainer.
   -Continue to monitor with ABG's
   -Adjust major acid/base disturbances with ventilation manipulation
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient had wbc in OSH of 8.4 on [**7-15**], currently  24.2.
   Patient spiked to 101.1, and CXR shows new middle lobe infilitrate.
   Also, C.diff cannot be ruled out as pt. w/ h/o diarrhea and acutely
   high WBC.
   - BCX, UCx and sputum culture, and C. diff toxin pending
   -Will start empiric treatment of VAP since new infiltrate shown on CXR;
   will start 7 day course of vanc/cefepime: will need ID approval
   -Since white count is markedly elevated and patient has h/o diarrhea,
   cannot exclude C. diff. Will start empiric treatment with flaygl
   pending c. diff toxin results.
   .
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   - Continue Prednisone 5 mg qAM and 2.5 mg qPM
   - H/o hypercalcemia -> will continue fosamax q weekly
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Will hold metformin and glipizide for now
   -Start humulog ISS for more predictable control
   -FSBS qachs
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Do not have recent lipid panel.
   -Will hold zetia
   -Will check lipid panel this AM
   -Start simvistatin 80 mg daily
   # HTN: patient currently hypotensive
   -Currently normotensive.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   -Continue Synthroid at 25 mcg daily
   # Depression:
   -Continue Paroxetine 10 mg daily
   # GERD:
   -Start H2 blocker (Famotidine) as PPI interacts with Plavix

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Rapid af leading to troponin elevation in setting of a tight distal lad
   lesion that was stented.  She has severe mulitiorgan sarcoidosis with
   muiltiple potential cardiac manifestation including heart block (at one
   time) requiring ddd pacer, atrial arrhythmias for which she was on
   sotalol for a while; even her cad could possibly be from sarcoid but
   obviously most likely from her usual risk factors of htn,
   hyperlipidemia, obesity, age, and diabetes.  I suspect that her atrial
   arrhythmias will be difficult to manage so we should get an eps
   consult.
   Physical Examination
   echo shows apical hk of the lv and apical akinesis of the rv with
   severe pulm htn (interestingly the rhc demonstrated only mild elevation
   of pulm vasc resistance which means that most of the blame for the pulm
   htn rests on diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle)
   Medical Decision Making
   Since it is of paramount importance to maintain sinus rhythm (or at
   very least a well-controlled ventricular rate in af), and since she has
   lung disease possibly precluding the drug of choice (amiodarone), we
   will get an eps consult.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]  on:[**2182-7-17**]
   11:14 ------
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sarcoidosis. She presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient also has a mild increase in troponin levels, indicative of possible ischemic changes on EKG. A cardiac catheterization revealed two-vessel disease, and the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the mid-left anterior descending artery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to flash pulmonary edema. There is a concern for continued respiratory failure, and weaning from the ventilator may be challenging.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may complicate her management, particularly in the setting of heart failure. An electrophysiology consult has been requested to optimize her antiarrhythmic therapy.
3. Ventricular Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of sarcoidosis and the presence of right ventricular akinesis on echocardiography, there is a concern for the development of ventricular arrhythmias.
4. Diabetic Complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and her glycemic control needs to be carefully monitored in the setting of acute illness.
5. Sarcoid"

   sarcoid, but superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents  with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient also with AFib with RVR causing hypotension. Also with mild
   troponin increase of 0.12 (peaked at 0.27 in OSH), ischemic changes on
   EKG (TWI) : Sent for cath and found 2 vessel disease, s/p BMS to LAD.
   .
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: found to have 2 vessel disease on cardiac cath.
   s/p BMS to the mid LAD. ? whether this was a primary coronary event or
   demand [**1-28**] RVR as pt. had acute heart failure yesterday and still has
   not significantly increased her troponin, would have expected large
   bump by now if infarct large enough to cause LV failure. EKG does
   appear to be c/w s/p anterior infarct.
   -Integrillin gtt until 18 hours post cath (stop at 1100)
   -Plavix 75 mg [**Hospital1 7**]; NO ASA b/c of allergy
   -Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   -Low dose metoprolol as patient tolerates
   -Hold ACE for now, given her hypotension and dye in cath
   - TTE in am to check for WMA
   .
   # PUMP: Noted to have EF of 60-70% on [**5-27**]. Current BNP elevated to
   [**Numeric Identifier 8933**] -> HF possibly secondary to sarcoidosis vs. CAD;  Fluid overload
   possibly secondary to acute heart failure; this is likely the etiology
   behind her flash pulmonary edema, likely that AF acutely led to
   increased rate, decreased filling time and loss of atrial kick.
   -Will hold diuresis as patient is hypotensive and on Phenylephrine
   -Once stable, will consider diuresing
   -Repeat TTE tomorrow
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with h/o afib with RVR, presents to unit in afib with
   RVR and hemodynamically unstable.
   -Dilt gtt started, bolus of 20 mg with infusion of [**5-15**] mg/hr as
   tolerated maintain HR < 110;
   - Since patient has a DDD pacemaker, will give as much nodal agents as
   needed for RVR, as patient will be paced out of bradycardia.
   - Neo gtt to maintain MAP > 60
   - Hold Sotolol for now
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR elevated to 2.3; continue home dose of coumadin as patient is at
   goal, but will hold heparin gtt.

   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF
   -intubated on AC; Will attempt PS today and ultimately wean from vent
   when HD stable
   -Check ABG's in AM
   - Diurese when BP allows for better resolution of pulmonary edema
   # Respiratory Acidosis with Metabolic Compensation: Patient h/o COPD on
   home oxygen secondary to sarcoidosis. Acid/Base disturbance likely
   secondary to COPD, as patient may be a CO2 retainer.
   -Continue to monitor with ABG's
   -Adjust major acid/base disturbances with ventilation manipulation
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient had wbc in OSH of 8.4 on [**7-15**], currently  24.2.
   Patient spiked to 101.1, and CXR shows new middle lobe infilitrate.
   Also, C.diff cannot be ruled out as pt. w/ h/o diarrhea and acutely
   high WBC.
   - BCX, UCx and sputum culture, and C. diff toxin pending
   -Will start empiric treatment of VAP since new infiltrate shown on CXR;
   will start 7 day course of vanc/cefepime: will need ID approval
   -Since white count is markedly elevated and patient has h/o diarrhea,
   cannot exclude C. diff. Will start empiric treatment with flaygl
   pending c. diff toxin results.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), sarcoidosis, and depression. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema, and her condition has been unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have two-vessel coronary artery disease, for which she received a bare-metal stent in the mid-left anterior descending artery. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, and she has been diagnosed with respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of AFib with RVR, coronary artery disease, and recent stenting, there is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and congestive heart failure.
2. Pulmonary Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and flash pulmonary edema, she may be at risk for pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and worsening respiratory distress.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and symptoms of diarrhea suggest a possible infection, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. Additionally, there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her intubation.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), sarcoidosis, and previous pacemaker placement. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient also had an elevated troponin level, indicating possible myocardial injury, and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed two-vessel disease. She subsequently underwent stenting of the mid-left anterior descending artery.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has evidence of two-vessel coronary artery disease, treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and placement of a bare-metal stent in the LAD.
2. Acute heart failure: The patient's acute heart failure episode resulted in flash pulmonary edema, for which she was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient continues to have episodes of AFib with RVR, requiring management with diltiazem infusion to control heart rate.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, necessitating the use of phenylephrine and Neo volume expanders to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and sarcoidosis. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient also had AFib with RVR causing hypotension. There was a mild increase in troponin levels, indicating ischemic changes on EKG (Twi). She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have two-vessel disease, for which she received a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient's current medications include Plavix 75 mg, simvastatin 80 mg daily, and low-dose metoprolol. She is being monitored closely for any signs of complications, such as ventricular arrhythmias, respiratory failure, or infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of AFib with RVR and recent myocardial infarction, there is a risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias. Close monitoring with telemetry is essential.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to acute decompensated heart failure (dCHF). Weaning from the ventilator will be attempted once her hemodynamic stability improves.
3. Infection"

   Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR, Intubated
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had agitation and hypertension in the setting of switching
   her ventilator settings to pressure support.  Her breathing appeared
   uncomfortable and her ABG at that time showed 7.36/56/63.  She was
   switched back to assist control.
   - She was Lasix 20mg IV and urinated 250cc.  She was then given 40mg IV
   Lasix and urinated 300cc.  She then began to have hypotension and went
   into Afib with RVR.
   - She entered Afib with RVR at approximately 18:00 with ventricular
   rate 130-160
s.  She was given 10mg Dilt bolus x 2, followed by a Dilt
   gtt at 20mg/hr.  She had MAP
s in the 50
s-60
s and required
   neosynephrine to maintain her BP.  At 20:45, she entered a paced rhythm
   with heart block at a ventricular rate of 60.  At that time the Dilt
   drip was held, and her po Dilt was increased to 90mg po qid.  Her MAP
   fell to approx. 52, and she was given a 250 cc NS bolus x2.  One po
   dose of Dilt was held overnight [**1-28**] low blood pressures.  Gave another
   500cc this am for low BP and started stress dose steroids.  She is no
   longer requiring neosynephrine.
   - At approximately 07:00 today, she went back into Afib with
   ventricular rates in the 120
s-130
s.  Given 10mg IV bolus of Dilt and
   Dilt gtt started at 10mg/hr.
   - She has been febrile to 102.2 at 20:00 last evening.  Her blood
   cultures grew GPC in clusters ([**12-28**] aerobic bottles), drawn from her
   line.  Blood cultures and sputum cultures were resent.
   - ECHO (Prelim): (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root
   is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is severe pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension (TR gradient 61mmHg).
   - EP: Recommended rate control. If QTc improves could reconsider
   antiarrhythmics. Amio is not ideal given lung disease. In AM call
   Cardiologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2679**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8981**]) and Pulm (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 902**]  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8982**],

   CXR [**7-17**]: [**Month (only) 51**] be a slight improvement in the extent of interstitial and
   peribronchial opacification in the left mid lung, suggesting that there
   is a component of mild pulmonary edema. How much chronic interstitial
   abnormality exists, as well as much of the partially calcified abundant
   central adenopathy is chronic and whether there is also pulmonary
   consolidation would depend upon comparison to prior chest imaging. An
   ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes below the
   diaphragm and out of view. Transvenous right atrial and right
   ventricular leads are unchanged in position. No pneumothorax.
   Echo ([**7-18**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
   is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded (LV apex not clearly seen). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   fat pad.

   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission, including yesterday evening. She was sent for cath and found
   to have 2 vessel disease, s/p BMS to LAD.  She now is intubated, on
   some sedation, and continues to have volatile blood pressure control
   and episodes of Afib with RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with continued episodes of Afib with RVR with
   hemodynamic instability.
   - Dilt gtt restarted this morning at 10mg/hr, will titrate to maintain
   HR < 110;
   - Since patient has a DDD pacemaker, will not hold back on nodal agents
   as needed for RVR, as patient will be paced out of bradycardia.
   - Start Lopressor
   - DC Diltiazem
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR at goal of [**1-29**] today (INR=2.5), will continue home dose of
   coumadin
   - Will continue to rate control per EP
   - Contact outside cardiologist and pulmonologist for ?amiodarone
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: found to have 2 vessel disease on cardiac cath
   s/p BMS to the mid LAD. ? whether this was a primary coronary event or
   demand [**1-28**] RVR as pt. had acute heart failure yesterday and still has
   not significantly increased her troponin, would have expected large
   bump by now if infarct large enough to cause LV failure. EKG does
   appear to be c/w s/p anterior infarct.   TTE yesterday showed normal
   EF, focal hypokinesis of apical free wall of RV, and severe pulmonary
   systolic hypertension.
   - Integrillin gtt has now stopped
   - Completed ASA desensitization yesterday
   - Switched Plavix 75 mg to daily instead of [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   - Start metroprolol low dose later today if BP tolerates
   - Hold ACE for now, given her hypotension, dye in cath, and bump in
   creatinine
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE yesterday. Current BNP.  Fluid overload
   possibly secondary afib with RVR; this is likely the etiology behind
   her flash pulmonary edema.  She is likely still fluid overloaded, but
   has been hypotensive with MAPs in the 50
s overnight.
   - Will hold diuresis as patient is hypotensive and currently in Afib
   with RVR
   - Once stable, will consider diuresing again
   - Started on stress dose steroids in order to supplement BP given
   possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension
   - intubated on AC; can attempt PS again today and ultimately wean from
   vent when HD stable
   - Serial ABG's
   - CXR in AM
   -  Will avoid albuterol [**1-28**] terbutaline allergy
   .
   #Anemia: Continues to trend down. Unable to guaiac stool (no BM). At
   this time thought to be secondary to marrow suppression.
   - Trend HCT
   # Respiratory Acidosis with Metabolic Compensation: Patient h/o COPD on
   home oxygen secondary to sarcoidosis. Acid/Base disturbance likely
   secondary to COPD, as patient may be a CO2 retainer.
   - Continue to monitor with ABG's
   - Adjust major acid/base disturbances with ventilation manipulation
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient still febrile to 102.2 with resolution of
   her leukocytosis (WBC 8.7 this am).  Being treated with Vanc/Cefepime
   and now with positive blood cultures of GPC.  Urine cx neg, sputum
   showed oropharyngeal flora.
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Day [**2-2**])
   - Continue Flagyl for possible C Diff infection, as cannot rule that
   out
   - Antibiotics approval received for Vanc/Cefepime
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with bump in creatinine today to 1.5
   (from 1.1 yesterday), likely prerenal etiology as consistently
   hypotensive overnight.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be related to dye given during cath,
   and possible septic shock.
   - Will calculate FeUrea to evaluated for prerenal etiology
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   - Continue to support BP for increased renal perfusion
   - Rate control her Afib to increased forward flow from heart
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   - Switched to stress dose steroids
   - H/o hypercalcemia -> will continue fosamax q weekly

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and sarcoidosis. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema and was found to have two-vessel coronary artery disease during cardiac catheterization, for which she underwent stenting of the left anterior descending artery. The patient continues to have episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension, requiring frequent medical interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring the use of various medications such as Lasix, Diltiazem, and neosynephrine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP).
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has had multiple episodes of AFib with RVR, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and requires rate control measures.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient initially presented with flash pulmonary edema, likely secondary to acute decompensated heart failure (dCHF). She required intubation and mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 1.5, indicating a possible prerenal etiology due to hypotension. This may be exacerbated by the"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission, including yesterday evening. She was sent for cath and found
   to have 2 vessel disease, s/p BMS to LAD.  She now is intubated, on
   some sedation, and continues to have volatile blood pressure control.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with h/o afib with RVR, presents to unit in afib with
   RVR and hemodynamically unstable.
   -Dilt gtt started, bolus of 20 mg with infusion of [**5-15**] mg/hr as
   tolerated maintain HR < 110;
   - Since patient has a DDD pacemaker, will give as much nodal agents as
   needed for RVR, as patient will be paced out of bradycardia.
   - Neo gtt to maintain MAP > 60
   - Start low dose metroprolol later today after ASA desensitization.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR elevated to 2.3; continue home dose of coumadin as patient is at
   goal, but will hold heparin gtt.
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: found to have 2 vessel disease on cardiac cath.
   s/p BMS to the mid LAD. ? whether this was a primary coronary event or
   demand [**1-28**] RVR as pt. had acute heart failure yesterday and still has
   not significantly increased her troponin, would have expected large
   bump by now if infarct large enough to cause LV failure. EKG does
   appear to be c/w s/p anterior infarct.
   - Integrillin gtt until 18 hours post cath (stop at 1100)
   - Plavix 75 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Start Aspirin desensitisation protocal
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   - Start metroprolol low dose later today.
   - Hold ACE for now, given her hypotension and dye in cath
   - TTE in am to check for WMA
   .
   # PUMP: Noted to have EF of 60-70% on [**5-27**]. Current BNP elevated to
   [**Numeric Identifier 8933**].  Fluid overload possibly secondary afib with RVR; this is likely
   the etiology behind her flash pulmonary edema.
   - Will hold diuresis as patient is hypotensive and on Phenylephrine
   - Once stable, will consider diuresing
   - FU TTE today
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF
   -intubated on AC; Will attempt PS today and ultimately wean from vent
   when HD stable; RISBI overnight was 29
   - Check ABG's in AM
   - Start Lasix 20 mg IV, FU I/Os adjust as needed.
   - CXR in AM
   - Attempt extubation today.
   - Avoid albuterol [**1-28**] terbutaline allergy
   # Respiratory Acidosis with Metabolic Compensation: Patient h/o COPD on
   home oxygen secondary to sarcoidosis. Acid/Base disturbance likely
   secondary to COPD, as patient may be a CO2 retainer.
   - Continue to monitor with ABG's
   - Adjust major acid/base disturbances with ventilation manipulation
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient had wbc in OSH of 8.4 on [**7-15**], currently  24.2.
   Patient spiked to 101.1, and CXR shows new middle lobe infilitrate.
   Also, C.diff cannot be ruled out as pt. w/ h/o diarrhea and acutely
   high WBC.
   - BCX, UCx and sputum culture, and C. diff toxin pending
   -Will start empiric treatment of VAP since new infiltrate shown on CXR;
   will start 7 day course of vanc/cefepime: will need ID approval
   -Since white count is markedly elevated and patient has h/o diarrhea,
   cannot exclude C. diff. Will start empiric treatment with flaygl
   pending c. diff toxin results.
   - Antibiotics approval received for Vanc/Cefepime
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with bump in creatinine today to 1.5
   (from 1.1 yesterday)
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   - Continue Prednisone 5 mg qAM and 2.5 mg qPM
   - H/o hypercalcemia -> will continue fosamax q weekly
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Will hold metformin and glipizide for now
   -Start humulog ISS for more predictable control
   -FSBS qachs
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Do not have recent lipid panel.
   -Will hold zetia
   -Will check lipid panel this AM
   -Start simvistatin 80 mg daily
   # HTN: patient currently hypotensive
   -Currently normotensive.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   -Continue Synthroid at 25 mcg daily
   # Depression:
   -Continue Paroxetine 10 mg daily
   # GERD:
   -Start H2 blocker (Famotidine) as PPI interacts with Plavix
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now; if fails weaning today, consider tube feeds;
   if successful extubation, attempt po diet

   Disposition:  CCU for now
","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, presenting with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. She has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension since admission, including yesterday evening. She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have two-vessel disease, for which she received a bare-metal stent to the left anterior descending artery. The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a possible line-related infection. She has also shown leukocytosis and a high white blood cell count, which may be indicative of an infection. The patient has been started on empirical treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infection. Her renal function has worsened, with an increase in creatinine from 1.1 to 1.5. She is also being treated for acute renal failure. Other medical conditions include sarcoidosis, dyslipidemia, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient's family has been informed of her condition and code status. She is currently in the critical care unit."

   Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR, Intubated
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had agitation and hypertension in the setting of switching
   her ventilator settings to pressure support.  Her breathing appeared
   uncomfortable and her ABG at that time showed 7.36/56/63.  She was
   switched back to assist control.
   - She was Lasix 20mg IV and urinated 250cc.  She was then given 40mg IV
   Lasix and urinated 300cc.  She then began to have hypotension and went
   into Afib with RVR.
   - She entered Afib with RVR at approximately 18:00 with ventricular
   rate 130-160
s.  She was given 10mg Dilt bolus x 2, followed by a Dilt
   gtt at 20mg/hr.  She had MAP
s in the 50
s-60
s and required
   neosynephrine to maintain her BP.  At 20:45, she entered a paced rhythm
   with heart block at a ventricular rate of 60.  At that time the Dilt
   drip was held, and her po Dilt was increased to 90mg po qid.  Her MAP
   fell to approx. 52, and she was given a 250 cc NS bolus x2.  One po
   dose of Dilt was held overnight [**1-28**] low blood pressures.  Gave another
   500cc this am for low BP and started stress dose steroids.  She is no
   longer requiring neosynephrine.
   - At approximately 07:00 today, she went back into Afib with
   ventricular rates in the 120
s-130
s.  Given 10mg IV bolus of Dilt and
   Dilt gtt started at 10mg/hr.
   - She has been febrile to 102.2 at 20:00 last evening.  Her blood
   cultures grew GPC in clusters ([**12-28**] aerobic bottles), drawn from her
   line.  Blood cultures and sputum cultures were resent.
   - ECHO (Prelim): (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root
   is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is severe pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension (TR gradient 61mmHg).
   - EP: Recommended rate control. If QTc improves could reconsider
   antiarrhythmics. Amio is not ideal given lung disease. In AM call
   Cardiologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2679**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8981**]) and Pulm (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 902**]  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8982**],
   [**Hospital3 **]) How do you feel about us starting amiodarone? Long QTc so
   limited medications.
   - Allergies updated on [**Name (NI) 2040**], Husband notes allergy to inhalants (unknown

   CXR [**7-17**]: [**Month (only) 51**] be a slight improvement in the extent of interstitial and
   peribronchial opacification in the left mid lung, suggesting that there
   is a component of mild pulmonary edema. How much chronic interstitial
   abnormality exists, as well as much of the partially calcified abundant
   central adenopathy is chronic and whether there is also pulmonary
   consolidation would depend upon comparison to prior chest imaging. An
   ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes below the
   diaphragm and out of view. Transvenous right atrial and right
   ventricular leads are unchanged in position. No pneumothorax.
   Echo ([**7-18**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
   is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded (LV apex not clearly seen). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   fat pad.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission, including yesterday evening. She was sent for cath and found
   to have 2 vessel disease, s/p BMS to LAD.  She now is intubated, on
   some sedation, and continues to have volatile blood pressure control
   and episodes of Afib with RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with continued episodes of Afib with RVR with
   hemodynamic instability.
   - Will d/c the dilt drip at this time and start metoprolol 100mg po
   TID, will also give 5mg IV lopressor bolus at this time
   - Since patient has a DDD pacemaker, will not hold back on nodal agents
   as needed for RVR, as patient will be paced out of bradycardia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR at goal of [**1-29**] today (INR=2.5), will continue home dose of
   coumadin
   - Will continue to rate control per EP
   - Contact outside cardiologist and pulmonologist for ?amiodarone
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: found to have 2 vessel disease on cardiac cath
   s/p BMS to the mid LAD. ? whether this was a primary coronary event or
   demand [**1-28**] RVR as pt. had acute heart failure yesterday and still has
   not significantly increased her troponin, would have expected large
   bump by now if infarct large enough to cause LV failure. EKG does
   appear to be c/w s/p anterior infarct.   TTE yesterday showed normal
   EF, focal hypokinesis of apical free wall of RV, and severe pulmonary
   systolic hypertension.
   - Integrillin gtt has now stopped
   - Completed ASA desensitization yesterday
   - Switched Plavix 75 mg to daily instead of [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   - Metoprolol to start today per above
   - Hold ACE for now, given her hypotension, dye in cath, and bump in
   creatinine
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE yesterday. Current BNP.  Fluid overload
   possibly secondary afib with RVR; this is likely the etiology behind
   her flash pulmonary edema.  She is likely still fluid overloaded, but
   has been hypotensive with MAPs in the 50
s overnight.
   - Will hold diuresis as patient is hypotensive and currently in Afib
   with RVR
   - Once stable, will consider diuresing again
   - Started on stress dose steroids in order to supplement BP given
   possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension
   - intubated on AC; can attempt PS again today and ultimately wean from
   vent when HD stable
   - Serial ABG's
   - CXR in AM
   -  Will avoid albuterol [**1-28**] terbutaline allergy
   .
   #Anemia: Continues to trend down. Unable to guaiac stool (no BM). At
   this time thought to be secondary to marrow suppression.
   - Trend HCT
   # Respiratory Acidosis with Metabolic Compensation: Patient h/o COPD on
   home oxygen secondary to sarcoidosis. Acid/Base disturbance likely
   secondary to COPD, as patient may be a CO2 retainer.
   - Continue to monitor with ABG's
   - Adjust major acid/base disturbances with ventilation manipulation
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient still febrile to 102.2 with resolution of
   her leukocytosis (WBC 8.7 this am).  Being treated with Vanc/Cefepime
   and now with positive blood cultures of GPC.  Urine cx neg, sputum
   showed oropharyngeal flora.
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Day [**2-2**])
   - Will stop flagyl at this time as concern for C Diff low
   - Antibiotics approval received for Vanc/Cefepime
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with bump in creatinine today to 1.5
   (from 1.1 yesterday), likely prerenal etiology as consistently
   hypotensive overnight.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be related to dye given during cath,
   and possible septic shock.
   - Will calculate FeUrea to evaluated for prerenal etiology
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   - Continue to support BP for increased renal perfusion
   - Rate control her Afib to increased forward flow from heart
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   - Switched to stress dose steroids
   - H/o hypercalcemia -> will continue fosamax q weekly
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Will hold metformin and glipizide for now.
   Fingersticks 231-332, not well-controlled.
   -Start humulog ISS for more predictable control, will add lantus dose
   for basal insulin
   -FSBS qac and qhs
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Lipid panel drawn yesterday (see above)
   - Holding zetia for now
   - On simvastatin 80 mg daily
   # Hypothyroidism:
   -Continue Synthroid at 25 mcg daily
   # Depression:
   -Continue Paroxetine 10 mg daily
   # GERD:
   -Start H2 blocker (Famotidine) as PPI interacts with Plavix

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:  would switch to beta blocker for
   a-fib v-rate control

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), sarcoidosis, and depression. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema and was found to have 2 vessel disease during cardiac catheterization, subsequently receiving bare metal stent (BMS) placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient continues to experience episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since admission.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol 100mg orally three times a day, lisinopril 20mg orally daily, aspirin 81mg orally daily, atorvastatin 80mg orally daily, and simvastatin 80mg orally daily. She is also on stress dose steroids due to the possibility of adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 76 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 109/41mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89-93% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 51%. She is intubated and on assist-control ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 450mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The plateau pressure is 20cmH2O.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 26mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -2mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 93%. Her serum creatinine level is elevated at 1.5mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 39mg/dL. The patient's leukocyte count has decreased from 14.3 to 8.7 thousand cells/microliter.

The patient's blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which are consistent with oropharyngeal flora. The sputum cultures showed multiple organisms c/w oropharyngeal flora. The urine culture was negative.

The patient's echocardiogram (echo) reveals a normal left atrium size without atrial septal defect. The left ventricular cavity size and global systolic function are normal with an ejection fraction (EF) of >55%. There is mild dilation of the right ventricular cavity with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level, and there is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows improvement in the extent of interstitial and peribronchial opacification in the left mid lung field, suggesting mild pulmonary edema. There is also mild calcification of the central adenopathy.

The patient's assessment and plan include rate control for AFib with RVR, ongoing management of acute renal failure, respiratory failure, anemia, respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, fever/leukocytosis, sarcoidosis, diabetes type"

   Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR, Intubated
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had agitation and hypertension in the setting of switching
   her ventilator settings to pressure support.  Her breathing appeared
   uncomfortable and her ABG at that time showed 7.36/56/63.  She was
   switched back to assist control.
   - She was Lasix 20mg IV and urinated 250cc.  She was then given 40mg IV
   Lasix and urinated 300cc.  She then began to have hypotension and went
   into Afib with RVR.
   - She entered Afib with RVR at approximately 18:00 with ventricular
   rate 130-160
s.  She was given 10mg Dilt bolus x 2, followed by a Dilt
   gtt at 20mg/hr.  She had MAP
s in the 50
s-60
s and required
   neosynephrine to maintain her BP.  At 20:45, she entered a paced rhythm
   with heart block at a ventricular rate of 60.  At that time the Dilt
   drip was held, and her po Dilt was increased to 90mg po qid.  Her MAP
   fell to approx. 52, and she was given a 250 cc NS bolus x2.  One po
   dose of Dilt was held overnight [**1-28**] low blood pressures.  Gave another
   500cc this am for low BP and started stress dose steroids.  She is no
   longer requiring neosynephrine.
   - At approximately 07:00 today, she went back into Afib with
   ventricular rates in the 120
s-130
s.  Given 10mg IV bolus of Dilt and
   Dilt gtt started at 10mg/hr.
   - She has been febrile to 102.2 at 20:00 last evening.  Her blood
   cultures grew GPC in clusters ([**12-28**] aerobic bottles), drawn from her
   line.  Blood cultures and sputum cultures were resent.
   - ECHO (Prelim): (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root
   is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is severe pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension (TR gradient 61mmHg).
   - EP: Recommended rate control. If QTc improves could reconsider
   antiarrhythmics. Amio is not ideal given lung disease. In AM call
   Cardiologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2679**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8981**]) and Pulm (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 902**]  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8982**],
   [**Hospital3 **]) How do you feel about us starting amiodarone? Long QTc so
   limited medications.

   CXR [**7-17**]: [**Month (only) 51**] be a slight improvement in the extent of interstitial and
   peribronchial opacification in the left mid lung, suggesting that there
   is a component of mild pulmonary edema. How much chronic interstitial
   abnormality exists, as well as much of the partially calcified abundant
   central adenopathy is chronic and whether there is also pulmonary
   consolidation would depend upon comparison to prior chest imaging. An
   ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes below the
   diaphragm and out of view. Transvenous right atrial and right
   ventricular leads are unchanged in position. No pneumothorax.
   Echo ([**7-18**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
   is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded (LV apex not clearly seen). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   fat pad.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission, including yesterday evening. She was sent for cath and found
   to have 2 vessel disease, s/p BMS to LAD.  She now is intubated, on
   some sedation, and continues to have volatile blood pressure control
   and episodes of Afib with RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with continued episodes of Afib with RVR with
   hemodynamic instability.
   - Dilt gtt restarted this morning at 10mg/hr, will titrate to maintain
   HR < 110;
   - Since patient has a DDD pacemaker, will not hold back on nodal agents
   as needed for RVR, as patient will be paced out of bradycardia.
   - Will restart Neo gtt as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
   - Consider low dose metroprolol later today if BP stabilizes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR at goal of [**1-29**] today (INR=2.5), will continue home dose of
   coumadin
   - Will continue to rate control per EP
   - Contact outside cardiologist and pulmonologist for ?amiodarone
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: found to have 2 vessel disease on cardiac cath
   s/p BMS to the mid LAD. ? whether this was a primary coronary event or
   demand [**1-28**] RVR as pt. had acute heart failure yesterday and still has
   not significantly increased her troponin, would have expected large
   bump by now if infarct large enough to cause LV failure. EKG does
   appear to be c/w s/p anterior infarct.   TTE yesterday showed normal
   EF, focal hypokinesis of apical free wall of RV, and severe pulmonary
   systolic hypertension.
   - Integrillin gtt has now stopped
   - Completed ASA desensitization yesterday
   - Switched Plavix 75 mg to daily instead of [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   - Start metroprolol low dose later today if BP tolerates
   - Hold ACE for now, given her hypotension, dye in cath, and bump in
   creatinine
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE yesterday. Current BNP.  Fluid overload
   possibly secondary afib with RVR; this is likely the etiology behind
   her flash pulmonary edema.  She is likely still fluid overloaded, but
   has been hypotensive with MAPs in the 50
s overnight.
   - Will hold diuresis as patient is hypotensive and currently in Afib
   with RVR
   - Once stable, will consider diuresing again
   - Started on stress dose steroids in order to supplement BP given
   possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension
   - intubated on AC; can attempt PS again today and ultimately wean from
   vent when HD stable
   - Serial ABG's
   - CXR in AM
   -  Will avoid albuterol [**1-28**] terbutaline allergy
   # Respiratory Acidosis with Metabolic Compensation: Patient h/o COPD on
   home oxygen secondary to sarcoidosis. Acid/Base disturbance likely
   secondary to COPD, as patient may be a CO2 retainer.
   - Continue to monitor with ABG's
   - Adjust major acid/base disturbances with ventilation manipulation
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient still febrile to 102.2 with resolution of
   her leukocytosis (WBC 8.7 this am).  Being treated with Vanc/Cefepime
   and now with positive blood cultures of GPC.  Urine cx neg, sputum
   showed oropharyngeal flora.
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Day [**2-2**])
   - Continue Flagyl for possible C Diff infection, as cannot rule that
   out
   - Antibiotics approval received for Vanc/Cefepime
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with bump in creatinine today to 1.5
   (from 1.1 yesterday), likely prerenal etiology as consistently
   hypotensive overnight
   - Will calculate FeUrea to evaluated for prerenal etiology
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   - Switched to stress dose steroids
   - H/o hypercalcemia -> will continue fosamax q weekly
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Will hold metformin and glipizide for now.
   Fingersticks 231-332, not well-controlled.
   -Start humulog ISS for more predictable control, will add lantus dose
   for basal insulin
   -FSBS qac and qhs
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Lipid panel drawn yesterday (see above)
   - Holding zetia for now
   - On simvastatin 80 mg daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sarcoidosis. She was admitted with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema and has been experiencing multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension since admission. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have two-vessel coronary artery disease, for which she received a bare-metal stent in the left anterior descending artery.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of AFib with RVR, which has resulted in hemodynamic instability and the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Heart Failure: The patient presented with acute heart failure, leading to flash pulmonary edema. She continues to be fluid overloaded and may require diuresis once stable.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has been diagnosed with two-vessel CAD, and she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with the placement of a bare-metal stent in the mid-left anterior descending artery.
4. Respiratory Failure: Due to the flash pulmonary edema and subsequent respiratory failure, the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
5. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient is febrile and has leukocytosis"

   Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR, Intubated
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had agitation and hypertension in the setting of switching
   her ventilator settings to pressure support.  Her breathing appeared
   uncomfortable and her ABG at that time showed 7.36/56/63.  She was
   switched back to assist control.
   - She was Lasix 20mg IV and urinated 250cc.  She was then given 40mg IV
   Lasix and urinated 300cc.  She then began to have hypotension and went
   into Afib with RVR.
   - She entered Afib with RVR at approximately 18:00 with ventricular
   rate 130-160
s.  She was given 10mg Dilt bolus x 2, followed by a Dilt
   gtt at 20mg/hr.  She had MAP
s in the 50
s-60
s and required
   neosynephrine to maintain her BP.  At 20:45, she entered a paced rhythm
   with heart block at a ventricular rate of 60.  At that time the Dilt
   drip was held, and her po Dilt was increased to 90mg po qid.  Her MAP
   fell to approx. 52, and she was given a 250 cc NS bolus x2.  One po
   dose of Dilt was held overnight [**1-28**] low blood pressures.  Gave another
   500cc this am for low BP and started stress dose steroids.  She is no
   longer requiring neosynephrine.
   - At approximately 07:00 today, she went back into Afib with
   ventricular rates in the 120
s-130
s.  Given 10mg IV bolus of Dilt and
   Dilt gtt started at 10mg/hr.
   - She has been febrile to 102.2 at 20:00 last evening.  Her blood
   cultures grew GPC in clusters ([**12-28**] aerobic bottles), drawn from her
   line.  Blood cultures and sputum cultures were resent.
   - ECHO (Prelim): (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root
   is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is severe pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension (TR gradient 61mmHg).
   - EP: Recommended rate control. If QTc improves could reconsider
   antiarrhythmics. Amio is not ideal given lung disease. In AM call
   Cardiologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2679**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8981**]) and Pulm (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 902**]  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8982**],
   [**Hospital3 **]) How do you feel about us starting amiodarone? Long QTc so
   limited medications.

   Disposition:  CCU for now
","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and sarcoidosis. She presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient has had multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since admission, including yesterday evening. She was sent for cardiac catheterization and found to have 2-vessel disease, subsequently receiving bare-metal stent (BMS) placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient is currently intubated and on sedation, with volatile blood pressure control and continued episodes of AFib with RVR. She has a history of COPD on home oxygen secondary to sarcoidosis, and her respiratory status is concerning for respiratory failure due to severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient's acid-base disturbance is likely secondary to COPD, as she may be a CO2 retainer.

Her renal function has deteriorated with an increase in creatinine to 1.5, possibly due to prerenal etiology, dye exposure during catheterization, and septic shock. The patient also has a fever and leukocytosis, which resolved after initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures grew Gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggestive of a possible hospital-acquired infection.

The patient has a history of diabetes type 2, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Her medications include various cardiac drugs, antidiabetic agents, lipid-lowering therapy, thyroid hormone replacement, antidepressants, and H2 blockers.

The patient's current plan includes close monitoring of vital signs, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, with titration of antiarrhythmic medications to maintain a heart rate below 110 beats per minute. She will be restarted on diltiazem at a low dose to control her heart rate. The need for amiodarone will be discussed with the cardiologist and pulmonologist. The patient will continue on stress dose steroids due to possible adrenal insufficiency.

Further interventions include weaning from mechanical ventilation, consideration of low-dose metoprolol, and adjusting acid-base disturbances with ventilation manipulation. The patient's fluid overload will be managed carefully, considering the risk of hypotension. Renal function will be monitored closely, and measures will be taken to support renal perfusion.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach to manage her acute heart failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, infection, and other comorbidities."

   Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR, Intubated
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had agitation and hypertension in the setting of switching
   her ventilator settings to pressure support.  Her breathing appeared
   uncomfortable and her ABG at that time showed 7.36/56/63.  She was
   switched back to assist control.
   - She was Lasix 20mg IV and urinated 250cc.  She was then given 40mg IV
   Lasix and urinated 300cc.  She then began to have hypotension and went
   into Afib with RVR.
   - She entered Afib with RVR at approximately 18:00 with ventricular
   rate 130-160
s.  She was given 10mg Dilt bolus x 2, followed by a Dilt
   gtt at 20mg/hr.  She had MAP
s in the 50
s-60
s and required
   neosynephrine to maintain her BP.  At 20:45, she entered a paced rhythm
   with heart block at a ventricular rate of 60.  At that time the Dilt
   drip was held, and her po Dilt was increased to 90mg po qid.  Her MAP
   fell to approx. 52, and she was given a 250 cc NS bolus x2.  One po
   dose of Dilt was held overnight [**1-28**] low blood pressures.  Gave another
   500cc this am for low BP and started stress dose steroids.  She is no
   longer requiring neosynephrine.
   - At approximately 07:00 today, she went back into Afib with
   ventricular rates in the 120
s-130
s.  Given 10mg IV bolus of Dilt and
   Dilt gtt started at 10mg/hr.
   - She has been febrile to 102.2 at 20:00 last evening.  Her blood
   cultures grew GPC in clusters ([**12-28**] aerobic bottles), drawn from her
   line.  Blood cultures and sputum cultures were resent.
   - ECHO (Prelim): (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root
   is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is severe pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension (TR gradient 61mmHg).
   - EP: Recommended rate control. If QTc improves could reconsider
   antiarrhythmics. Amio is not ideal given lung disease. In AM call
   Cardiologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2679**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8981**]) and Pulm (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 902**]  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8982**],
   [**Hospital3 **]) How do you feel about us starting amiodarone? Long QTc so
   limited medications.

   CXR [**7-17**]: [**Month (only) 51**] be a slight improvement in the extent of interstitial and
   peribronchial opacification in the left mid lung, suggesting that there
   is a component of mild pulmonary edema. How much chronic interstitial
   abnormality exists, as well as much of the partially calcified abundant
   central adenopathy is chronic and whether there is also pulmonary
   consolidation would depend upon comparison to prior chest imaging. An
   ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes below the
   diaphragm and out of view. Transvenous right atrial and right
   ventricular leads are unchanged in position. No pneumothorax.
   Echo ([**7-18**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
   is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded (LV apex not clearly seen). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   fat pad.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission, including yesterday evening. She was sent for cath and found
   to have 2 vessel disease, s/p BMS to LAD.  She now is intubated, on
   some sedation, and continues to have volatile blood pressure control
   and episodes of Afib with RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with continued episodes of Afib with RVR with
   hemodynamic instability.
   - Will d/c the dilt drip at this time and start metoprolol 100mg po
   TID, will also give 5mg IV lopressor bolus at this time
   - Since patient has a DDD pacemaker, will not hold back on nodal agents
   as needed for RVR, as patient will be paced out of bradycardia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR at goal of [**1-29**] today (INR=2.5), will continue home dose of
   coumadin
   - Will continue to rate control per EP
   - Contact outside cardiologist and pulmonologist for ?amiodarone
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: found to have 2 vessel disease on cardiac cath
   s/p BMS to the mid LAD. ? whether this was a primary coronary event or
   demand [**1-28**] RVR as pt. had acute heart failure yesterday and still has
   not significantly increased her troponin, would have expected large
   bump by now if infarct large enough to cause LV failure. EKG does
   appear to be c/w s/p anterior infarct.   TTE yesterday showed normal
   EF, focal hypokinesis of apical free wall of RV, and severe pulmonary
   systolic hypertension.
   - Integrillin gtt has now stopped
   - Completed ASA desensitization yesterday
   - Switched Plavix 75 mg to daily instead of [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   - Metoprolol to start today per above
   - Hold ACE for now, given her hypotension, dye in cath, and bump in
   creatinine
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE yesterday. Current BNP.  Fluid overload
   possibly secondary afib with RVR; this is likely the etiology behind
   her flash pulmonary edema.  She is likely still fluid overloaded, but
   has been hypotensive with MAPs in the 50
s overnight.
   - Will hold diuresis as patient is hypotensive and currently in Afib
   with RVR
   - Once stable, will consider diuresing again
   - Started on stress dose steroids in order to supplement BP given
   possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension
   - intubated on AC; can attempt PS again today and ultimately wean from
   vent when HD stable
   - Serial ABG's
   - CXR in AM
   -  Will avoid albuterol [**1-28**] terbutaline allergy
   .
   #Anemia: Continues to trend down. Unable to guaiac stool (no BM). At
   this time thought to be secondary to marrow suppression.
   - Trend HCT
   # Respiratory Acidosis with Metabolic Compensation: Patient h/o COPD on
   home oxygen secondary to sarcoidosis. Acid/Base disturbance likely
   secondary to COPD, as patient may be a CO2 retainer.
   - Continue to monitor with ABG's
   - Adjust major acid/base disturbances with ventilation manipulation
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient still febrile to 102.2 with resolution of
   her leukocytosis (WBC 8.7 this am).  Being treated with Vanc/Cefepime
   and now with positive blood cultures of GPC.  Urine cx neg, sputum
   showed oropharyngeal flora.
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Day [**2-2**])
   - Will stop flagyl at this time as concern for C Diff low
   - Antibiotics approval received for Vanc/Cefepime
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with bump in creatinine today to 1.5
   (from 1.1 yesterday), likely prerenal etiology as consistently
   hypotensive overnight.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be related to dye given during cath,
   and possible septic shock.
   - Will calculate FeUrea to evaluated for prerenal etiology
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   - Continue to support BP for increased renal perfusion
   - Rate control her Afib to increased forward flow from heart
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   - Switched to stress dose steroids
   - H/o hypercalcemia -> will continue fosamax q weekly
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Will hold metformin and glipizide for now.
   Fingersticks 231-332, not well-controlled.
   -Start humulog ISS for more predictable control, will add lantus dose
   for basal insulin
   -FSBS qac and qhs
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Lipid panel drawn yesterday (see above)
   - Holding zetia for now
   - On simvastatin 80 mg daily
   # Hypothyroidism:
   -Continue Synthroid at 25 mcg daily
   # Depression:

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission. She was sent for cath and found to have 2 vessel disease,
   s/p BMS to LAD.  She now is intubated, sedated. AFib now controlled.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus for approx. 24 hours. EKG with long QTc.
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg po TID; once she has 5 grams of amio, will
   cut back metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR at goal of [**1-29**], today (INR=2.6), since patient will be long term
   in CCU, will stop coumadin and allow drift of INR to 2
 and will need
   to place PICC at that time.
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: 2 vessel disease s/p BMS to the mid LAD.
   - Plavix 75 mg Daily
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   -  ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Metoprolol to start today per above
   - Hold ACE for now, one more day without hypotension and good urine
   output.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient still febrile to 100.2 with resolution of
   her leukocytosis (WBC 5.1 this am).  Being treated with Vanc/Cefepime
   and now with positive blood cultures of GPC.  Urine cx neg, sputum
   showed oropharyngeal flora.
   - Fu Blood Cultures (7/22,[**7-18**]) and Sputum ([**7-17**]).
   - FU sensitivities from positive blood culture
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Day [**3-2**]); Vanc level high and last nights
   vanc dose was held. Will continue to monitor
   - Stopped flagyl at this time as concern for C Diff low
   - Antibiotics approval received for Vanc/Cefepime
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension. Mucus plug removed yesterday.
   - intubated on AC; wean peap and attempt PS again today and ultimately
   wean from vent when HD stable
   - Serial ABG's
   - CXR in AM
   -  Will avoid albuterol [**1-28**] terbutaline allergy
   - Pulmonary following
appreciate recs
   - Lung CT scan w/o contrast per Pulmonary
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE yesterday. Fluid overload possibly secondary
   afib with RVR; this is likely the etiology behind her flash pulmonary
   edema.  . To date patient is positive approx. one liter.
   - Once stable, will consider diuresing again
   - Started on stress dose steroids in order to supplement BP given
   possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   .
   #Anemia: Stable since yesterday (25). Unable to guaiac stool (no BM).
   At this time thought to be secondary to marrow suppression.
   -          Trend HCT daily
   -          Transfuse < 21.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Crt down today from 1.5 to 1.1. Most likely
   secondary to hypotension in setting of afib rvr.  FeUrea 8.16% is
   consistent with pre renal etiology..
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   - Continue to support BP for increased renal perfusion
   - Rate control her Afib to increased forward flow from heart
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   - Switched to stress dose steroids
   - H/o hypercalcemia -> will continue fosamax q weekly
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Will hold metformin and glipizide for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, sarcoidosis, and depression. She was admitted with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. She has had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response since admission. She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have two-vessel disease, for which she received bare metal stenting in the left anterior descending artery.

She is currently intubated and sedated, but her rhythm is now in sinus rhythm. The patient has been febrile with a temperature of 100.2°F and leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 15.0), but her white blood cell count has improved to 5.1 today. Blood cultures have grown Staphylococcus coagulase-negative, isolated from one set only. Her sputum culture showed oropharyngeal flora.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and her breath sounds are greatly improved this morning. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 16, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and is maintaining an oxygen saturation of 97%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 277.

Her renal function has also improved, with a creatinine level down from 1.5 to 1.1. Her blood glucose levels have been unstable, requiring a total of 22 units of Humalog and increasing her Lantus dose by 10 units.

Other assessments and plans include:
- Continue metoprolol 100mg po TID and amiodarone 400mg po BID.
- Monitor on telemetry.
- INR at goal of 2.0.
- Plavix 75 mg daily, simvastatin 80 mg daily, and ASA 325 mg daily for coronary artery disease.
- Hold ACE for now.
- Continue Vanc/cefepime (Day 3) and monitor vancomycin levels.
- Stopped flagyl due to concern for C. difficile.
- Antibiotics approval received for Vanc/cefepime.
- Intubation plan: wean peep and attempt PS again today, ultimately wean from vent when HD stable.
- Serial ABG's and CXR in AM.
- Avoid albuterol and terbutaline allergy.
- Pulmonary follow-up appreciated.
- Lung CT scan w/o contrast per Pulmonary.
- PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE yesterday. Fluid overload possibly secondary to AFib with RVR; this is likely the etiology behind her flash pulmonary edema.
- Once stable, will consider diuresing"

   edema.  . To date patient is positive approx. one liter.
   - Once stable, will consider diuresing again
   - Started on stress dose steroids in order to supplement BP given
   possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   .

   Disposition:  CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, sarcoidosis, and depression. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been intubated and sedated, with episodes of atrial fibrillation that were successfully converted back to sinus rhythm using metoprolol and diltiazem.

The patient's current medications include Plavix, simvastatin, ASA, metoprolol, amiodarone, Lantus, Humalog, famotidine, synthroid, paroxetine, and stress dose steroids. She is also receiving tube feeds for nutrition.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F (38°C), blood pressure ranging from 95/43-168/64 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on mechanical ventilation.

Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count (15.0 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin (7.7 g/dL), elevated blood glucose (324 mg/dL), and an elevated creatinine level (1.1 mg/dL). The ECG shows a long QTc interval.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including coronary artery disease (2-vessel disease), NSTEMI, acute renal failure, anemia, and respiratory failure. She is currently being treated for a GPC bacteremia with vancomycin and cefepime, and her sputum culture showed oropharyngeal flora.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, infections (such as C. difficile), pulmonary hypertension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further deterioration of renal function.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional clinical assessment and evaluation may be required for a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Stopped dilt, given 5mg IV metop and 100mg metop TID, converted back
   to sinus rhythm by 11am.  Stayed in sinus rhythm throughout the day -
   ECG done while in sinus rhythm, still with some QT prolongation.
   - Episode of desats to the 70's [**1-28**] mucous plugging, O2 sats came up to
   100 so likely had had mucous plug all day (in morning sats were ~90%).
   RT decreased FiO2 back to 50% (from 60)
   - Now on 16 units glargine due to high blood sugars
   - Called outside pulm doc who is okay with amiodarone, unable to send
   us records right now. Talked to EP who thought amiodarone good idea,
   started Amiodarone 400 mg PO BID
   - Decided to leave in fem line as of right now, as was placed under
   sterile conditions and after she spiked fevers.
   - Stopped Flagyl as unlikely to be C Diff causing infection
   - Vanc level high, decreased to 750mg IV q12h

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was treated with medications including diltiazem, metoprolol, and amiodarone. She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have two-vessel coronary artery disease, for which she received a bare-metal stent in the left anterior descending artery.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and her rhythm has been converted to sinus rhythm. However, she still has some QT prolongation on her ECG. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.2°F (38°C), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/43-168/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has a history of sarcoidosis and is on home oxygen. She also has a history of depression, hypothyroidism, diabetes type 2, dyslipidemia, and GERD. Her laboratory results show"

   s/p BMS to LAD.  She now is intubated, sedated. AFib overnight with
   inadequate rate control.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus for approx. 24 hours. EKG with long QTc.  Patient in
   afib with rates in the 100s to 120s starting at midnight; 10 mg IV
   metoprolol and 10 mg of IV dilt did not help decrease the rate. Patient
   with stable BP.
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg po TID; once she has 5 grams of amio, will
   cut back metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR at goal of [**1-29**], today (INR=2.6), since patient will be long term
   in CCU, will stop coumadin and allow drift of INR to 2
   - Consider starting Heparin gtt as INR is 1.8 today.
   - Will need to place PICC at that time.
   -Will wean metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**] at 5 grams of amiodorone is in
   system...Sunday.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient afebrile overnight with an increase in
   wbc from 5.1 to 13.7.  Being treated with Vanc/Cefepime and with
   positive blood cultures of coag negative staph in

   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Day [**4-2**]); Vanc level high and last nights
   vanc dose was held. Will continue to monitor
   - Stopped flagyl;
   -  with return of leukocytosis consider restarting flagyl or double
   coverage for pseudomonus
   - Antibiotics approval received for Vanc/Cefepime
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension. Mucus plug removed yesterday.
   - Currently on PS 5/5 with decent ABG and RSBI this AM. If mental
   status improves off sedation, consider extubation today.
   - Serial ABG's
   -  Will avoid albuterol [**1-28**] terbutaline allergy
   - Pulmonary following
appreciate recs
   - Lung CT scan w/o contrast per Pulmonary shows severe sarcoid. Will
   obtain old CT/PFT from outpatient pulmonologist on Monday to help
   better assess disease progression
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: 2 vessel disease s/p BMS to the mid LAD.
   - Plavix 75 mg Daily
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   -  ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Metoprolol to start today per above
   - Hold ACE for now, one more day without hypotension and good urine
   output.
   .
   Hypernatremia: Na 149 today; likely hypervolemic hypernatremia. Free
   Water deficit.
   -          Changed tube feed flushes to free water flushes 50 cc q 4
   hours.
   -          Check Na this PM
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Will hold metformin and glipizide for now.  Sliding
   scale with 26 units of lantus not well controlled as fsbs in the
   300s-400s. Insulin gtt started in evening and improving blood sugars.
   Trending down from 415 to 178.
   - continue insulin gtt until blood sugar well controlled. Once at
   optimal level (120-180) will transition to more aggressive sliding
   scale based on amount of insulin needed in past 24 hours.
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE yesterday. Fluid overload possibly secondary
   afib with RVR; this is likely the etiology behind her flash pulmonary
   edema.  . Patient appeared fluid overloaded and s/p 20 mg IV lasix at
   1800 (UOP of 400 cc) and 2200 (UOP 200cc); -220 cc since
   midnight
positive 4.5 liters LOS; patient appears fluid overloaded
   - Will diurese today: 40 mg IV lasix and re-assess from there as
   patient appears fluid overloaded
   - Started on stress dose steroids in order to supplement BP given
   possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   .
   #Anemia: Stable; Hct 26. Unable to guaiac stool (no BM). At this time
   thought to be secondary to marrow suppression.
   -          Trend HCT daily
   -          Transfuse < 21.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Crt stable at 1.1. Most likely secondary to
   hypotension in setting of afib rvr.  FeUrea 8.16% is consistent with
   pre renal etiology..

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and sarcoidosis. She presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient has had multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since admission.

She was sent for a cardiac catheterization and found to have two-vessel disease, for which she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to respiratory failure. She has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation with fast rates, despite receiving metoprolol and diltiazem. Her blood glucose levels have been consistently high, ranging from 400 to 375 mg/dL, and she has been started on insulin gtt to control her blood sugar levels.

She also has a fever and leukocytosis, with positive blood cultures for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. She has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime, but her vancomycin levels were high, so the dose was held. Further culture and sensitivity results are pending.

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly since the removal of a mucus plug yesterday. She is currently on pressure support level "

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission. She was sent for cath and found to have 2 vessel disease,
   s/p BMS to LAD.  She now is intubated, sedated. AFib overnight with
   inadequate rate control.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus for approx. 24 hours. EKG with long QTc.  Patient in
   afib with rates in the 100s to 120s starting at midnight; 10 mg IV
   metoprolol and 10 mg of IV dilt did not help decrease the rate. Patient
   with stable BP.
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg po TID; once she has 5 grams of amio, will
   cut back metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - INR at goal of [**1-29**], today (INR=2.6), since patient will be long term
   in CCU, will stop coumadin and allow drift of INR to 2
   - Consider starting Heparin gtt as INR is 1.8 today.
   - Will need to place PICC at that time.
   -Will wean metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**] at 5 grams of amiodorone is in
   system...Sunday.
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient afebrile overnight with an increase in
   wbc from 5.1 to 13.7.  Being treated with Vanc/Cefepime and with
   positive blood cultures of coag negative staph in
 bottles. Still
   waiting for further culture and sensitivities.  Urine cx neg, sputum
   showed oropharyngeal flora.
   - Fu Blood Cultures (7/22,[**7-18**],) and Sputum ([**7-17**], [**7-19**]).
   - FU sensitivities from positive blood culture
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Day [**4-2**]); Vanc level high and last nights
   vanc dose was held. Will continue to monitor
   - Stopped flagyl;
   -  with return of leukocytosis consider restarting flagyl or double
   coverage for pseudomonus
   - Antibiotics approval received for Vanc/Cefepime
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension. Mucus plug removed yesterday.
   - Currently on PS 5/5 with decent ABG and RSBI this AM. If mental
   status improves off sedation, consider extubation today.
   - Serial ABG's
   -  Will avoid albuterol [**1-28**] terbutaline allergy
   - Pulmonary following
appreciate recs
   - Lung CT scan w/o contrast per Pulmonary shows severe sarcoid. Will
   obtain old CT/PFT from outpatient pulmonologist on Monday to help
   better assess disease progression
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: 2 vessel disease s/p BMS to the mid LAD.
   - Plavix 75 mg Daily
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   -  ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Metoprolol to start today per above
   - Hold ACE for now, one more day without hypotension and good urine
   output.
   .
   Hypernatremia: Na 149 today; likely hypervolemic hypernatremia. Free
   Water deficit.
   -          Changed tube feed flushes to free water flushes 50 cc q 4
   hours.
   -          Check Na this PM
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Will hold metformin and glipizide for now.  Sliding
   scale with 26 units of lantus not well controlled as fsbs in the
   300s-400s. Insulin gtt started in evening and improving blood sugars.
   Trending down from 415 to 178.
   - continue insulin gtt until blood sugar well controlled. Once at
   optimal level (120-180) will transition to more aggressive sliding
   scale based on amount of insulin needed in past 24 hours.
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE yesterday. Fluid overload possibly secondary
   afib with RVR; this is likely the etiology behind her flash pulmonary
   edema.  . Patient appeared fluid overloaded and s/p 20 mg IV lasix at
   1800 (UOP of 400 cc) and 2200 (UOP 200cc); -220 cc since
   midnight
positive 4.5 liters LOS; patient appears fluid overloaded
   - Will diurese today: 40 mg IV lasix and re-assess from there as
   patient appears fluid overloaded
   - Started on stress dose steroids in order to supplement BP given
   possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   .
   #Anemia: Stable; Hct 26. Unable to guaiac stool (no BM). At this time
   thought to be secondary to marrow suppression.
   -          Trend HCT daily
   -          Transfuse < 21.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Crt stable at 1.1. Most likely secondary to
   hypotension in setting of afib rvr.  FeUrea 8.16% is consistent with
   pre renal etiology..
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   - Continue to support BP for increased renal perfusion
   - Rate control her Afib to increased forward flow from heart
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   - Switched to stress dose steroids
   - H/o hypercalcemia -> will continue fosamax q weekly
   .
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Lipid panel shows TC 157, TG: 156 HDL 30 LDLc 96; Not
   optimal HDL/LDL level
   - Holding zetia for now
   - Continue simvastatin 80 mg daily
   # Hypothyroidism:
   -Continue Synthroid at 25 mcg daily
   # Depression:
   -Continue Paroxetine 10 mg daily
   # GERD:
   -Start H2 blocker (Famotidine) as PPI interacts with Plavix

- The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and hypotension since admission.
- She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have two-vessel coronary artery disease, for which she received bare-metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery.
- The patient is currently intubated and sedated. She has been in atrial fibrillation with rates in the 100s to 120s since midnight, and rate control medications have not been effective in reducing the rate.
- Her blood sugar levels have been elevated, with readings in the 300s. Insulin therapy has been initiated to control her blood sugar levels.
- A CT chest revealed severe sarcoidosis and no evidence of acute infection. There is also a tiny left pleural effusion.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she still has coarse breath sounds on the left side.
- She has leukocytosis with an increased white blood cell count from 5.1 to 13.7. Blood cultures have grown coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and sputum culture showed oropharyngeal flora.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sarcoidosis. She presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema and has been intubated and sedated. The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response since admission. She underwent coronary angiography and was found to have two-vessel disease, for which she received a bare metal stent in the left anterior descending artery.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has experienced several episodes of AFib with RVR since admission. Despite receiving metoprolol and diltiazem, her heart rate remains uncontrolled. She is currently on amiodarone and will be monitored on telemetry.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has two-vessel disease and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with placement of a bare metal stent in the left anterior descending artery.
3. Acute Heart Failure (AHF): The patient's presentation of acute heart failure was likely secondary to AFib with RVR, which resulted in flash pulmonary edema. She has been treated with diuretics and is being monitored closely.
4. Sarcoidosis: The patient has a history of sarcoidosis, and a recent CT scan revealed severe pulmonary involvement"

   Chief Complaint: NSTEMI/AFIB/ACUTE DIASTOLIC FAILURE
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient went into afib with a rate into the 100-120 with good
   pressures around 0030...gave po metoprolol early and 1 and a 1/2 hours
   later still fast. gave 5 mg IV lopressor x 2 at 0200; gave 10 mg IV
   diltiazem
still in afib with fast rate
stable BP.
   -This AM afib fast into the 130s
gave 5 mg IV lopressor.. and po 100mg
   lopressor dose early.
   - Blood sugar was >400 at 1130. Patient's lantus dose increased from 16
   to 26 today. Given 15 units Humalog Insulin at 1145. BS 375 at 1700,
   gave another 18 units of humulog
still in the 300
s so started insulin
   gtt at [**2202**]; BS
s trending down overnight.
   - CT Chest: Findings are compatible with severe sarcoidosis. No
   definite CT evidence of superimposed acute infectious process. Tiny
   left pleural effusion.
   - Pulm: will f/u with pulmonologist to get old CT/PFTs; comparison
   helpful for treatment with steroids...pulm will follow
   - Weaning sedation this AM; tube feeds stopped at 0400 for hopes of
   extubation today as RSBI is 42; ABG this AM on PS 5/5 is probably
   baseline 7.36/56/95 still with decreased mental status and increased
   secretions.
   - Fluid overloaded: gave 20 IV lasix...put out a good bit, so gave
   another 20 mg at 2200 b/c she is still fluid overloaded

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: We will attempt extubation and
   continue amio and rate control for her atrial fib.  She has severe
   pulmonary sarcoidosis, and in all probability, cardiac sarcoidosis.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sarcoidosis. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response since admission. She was sent for cardiac catheterization and found to have two-vessel disease, and subsequently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and her condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs and lab results. She has been treated with various medications, including metoprolol, diltiazem, amiodarone, vancomycin, cefepime, furosemide, and insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response since admission. Rate control measures have been implemented, but the patient remains in atrial fibrillation.

2. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient initially presented with flash pulmonary edema secondary to acute decompensated heart failure. She continues to show signs of fluid overload and may require further diuresis.

3. Infection: The patient has shown leukocytosis and positive blood"

   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission. She was sent for cath and found to have 2 vessel disease,
   s/p BMS to LAD.  Now extubated with Afib with rate 110-130.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension. Extubated yesterday. Doing surprisingly well. Required
   3-4 hours of BIPAP.  .

   - Will put back on BiPap this morning as patient appears that she is
   tiring out.  Hope to be able to do intermittent BiPap to allow patient
   to rest.
   - Started Xopenex/Iprotroprium Q4Hours without any abnormal reaction.
   - Pulmonary following
appreciate recs
   - Obtain old CT/PFT from outpatient pulmonologist on Monday to help
   better assess disease progression. Family will bring in copy of most
   recent CT scan.
   - Continue to treat with Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl
   - Doesn
t seem volume overloaded on exam, but can try Lasix if patient
   approaching re-intubation
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient in afib with rates in the 100s to 130s.
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg po TID; once she has 5 grams of amio, will
   cut back metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Increase Diltiazem 60mg QID, after 2 doses, will increase Dilt as
   needed for rate control
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue to hold coumadin, restart on DC.
   - FU INR later today. If less than 1.[**Street Address(2) 9023**] subclavian.
   - Will wean metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**] at 5 grams of amiodorone is in system,
   today.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient febrile yesterday with rectal temp of
   102.  Being treated with Vanc/Cefepime and with positive blood cultures
   of coag negative staph in
 bottles. Repeat blood cultures with no
   growth to date. Urine with no growth to date. Sputum with oropharyngeal
   flora.
   - Consider intraabdominal infection, no stool cultures, consider
   imaging abdomen
   - Could be constipation-variant C Diff
 will add on Vanc 650mg po q6h
   at this time
   - Consider adding double coverage for anaerobes or pseudomonas,
   although prolonged QT interval
   - Will pull femoral line today, and put in IJ for access this
   afternoon.
   - FU CBC Diff
   - Redraw blood cultures today.
   - Fu Blood Cultures (7/22,7/23,[**7-21**]) and Sputum ([**7-17**], [**7-19**]).
   - FU sensitivities from positive blood culture
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime (Day [**5-2**]); Vanc trough high at 23. Continue
   with current dosing.
   - Will continue Flagyl for possible Diff
   .
   #Neuro Status: Sedation stopped ([**7-20**]). Pt appears to be slowly
   improving. Responds to name this AM.
   - Follow neuro status
   # Left arm swelling
 possible DVT?
   - Will get left upper extremity swelling
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: 2 vessel disease s/p BMS to the mid LAD.
   - Plavix 75 mg Daily
   - Simvistatin 80 mg daily
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - Captopril 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hypertension
 typically okay BP
s when not in respiratory distress,
   added Captopril yesterday.
   - will watch, possible increase in Captopril today in necessary and not
   improving with increased dose of Diltiazem
   Hypernatremia: Resolved after 2L of D5W. Pt had a 4L Free Water
   deficit.
   - Follow Na daily.
   - Will hold D5W at this time
   - Will decrease stress-dose steroids
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Consider insulin gtt until patient more stable and
   accurate assessment of insulin needs can be assessed.
   -          Follow finger sticks.
   -          Transition to Lantus plus sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE. Patient even over the last 24 hours. Dose
   not appear to be volume overloaded on exam.
   - Started on stress dose steroids in order to supplement BP given
   possibility of adrenal insufficiency
   .
   #Anemia: Stable; Hct 27. Unable to guaiac stool (no BM). At this time
   thought to be secondary to marrow suppression.
   -          Trend HCT daily
   -          Transfuse < 21.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Crt stable at 0.9. Most likely secondary to
   hypotension in setting of afib rvr.  FeUrea 8.16% is consistent with
   pre renal etiology..
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   - Continue to support BP for increased renal perfusion
   - Rate control her Afib to increased forward flow from heart
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   - Switched to stress dose steroids
   - H/o hypercalcemia -> will continue fosamax q weekly

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sarcoidosis. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. She had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension since admission. She underwent a cardiac catheterization and was found to have 2-vessel disease, for which she received a bare-metal stent in the left anterior descending artery. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure but was extubated yesterday. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support with BIPAP and has shown improvement. The patient has several medical complications, including fever, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, diabetes type 2, anemia, acute renal failure, sarcoidosis, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism, depression, and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to acute decompensated heart failure. Although she has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if her heart condition worsens or if she develops any complications related to her pulmonary function.

2. Infection: The patient presented with fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. Blood cultures showed growth of coag-negative staphylococcus"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:  Her situation has not improvbed.
   We extubated her and she is requiring bipap intermittently.  We now
   know that her pulmonary sarcoidosis is truly end-stage and the husband
   has indicated that her baseline functional status is very limited.
   Will readdress code status in light of these facts.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sarcoidosis. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. She was intubated and treated with vanc/cefepime and flagyl for possible C. difficile infection. The patient's neurological status has slowly improved, and she is now extubated but requires intermittent BiPAP support. She has multiple medical complications including anemia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and hypertension. She also has a history of NSTEMI with two-vessel disease, treated with BMS to the mid LAD. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, diltiazem, captopril, simvastatin, ASA, Plavix, and Synthroid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to flash pulmonary edema and is now extubated but requires intermittent BiPAP support. There is a risk of re-intubation if her respiratory status worsens.
2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rates in the 100s to 130s. She is being treated with metoprolol, diltiazem, and amiodarone to control her heart rate. There is a risk of further rhythm disturbances or un"

   Chief Complaint: Intubated in CCU
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had full family meeting yesterday with her husband and multiple sons
   and daughters.  The family decided that their first priority is comfort
   for the patient, and her code status was changed to DNR/DNI.  We
   initially continued to monitor her respiratory status with VBG
   However,  her PCO2 began to climb on her VBG and she appeared to be
   gasping for air and uncomfortable.  She was started on a morphine drip
   (initially at 1mg/hr).  After this, her respirations were much more
   unlabored, she converted to sinus rhythm with rates in the 60-70
s, and
   she was no longer hypertensive.
   - She also had high fevers throughout the day to 104.8, which broke
   with a cooling blanket, Tylenol, and morphine administration.
   - One episode of feeling pain and shortness of breath last evening,
   given 0.5mg Ativan IV which helped calm her down
   - She continues on medications for rate control/rhythm control, as well
   as for her breathing comfort.  Other medications were discontinued, as
   well blood draws.  The family decided against a new central line,
   femoral line was left in for now.
   - Left UE US showed no evidence of DVT on prelim read

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission. She was sent for cath and found to have 2 vessel disease,
   s/p BMS to LAD.  Now extubated and breathing comfortably with morphine
   administration.  She is in and out of Afib with rate 110-130, current
   in sinus or paced rhythm with rate 60-70. Currently status is DNR/DNI
   and not CMO
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension. Extubated two days ago with increased respiratory
   distress yesterday afternoon requiring treatment with morphine.  BiPap
   was an option yesterday afternoon but with family
s goals of care in
   mind, a morphine drip was started.
   - Doing well this morning with more comfortable breathing
   - Continue to titrate morphine drip as needed for respiratory distress;
   but will try to decrease morphine to improve wakefulness
   - Continue Xopenex/Iprotroprium nebs Q4Hours as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient now in sinus rhythm, recently in afib with rates in
   the 100s to 130s.
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg po TID; once she has 5 grams of amio, will
   cut back metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue Diltiazem 60mg QID, after 2 doses, will increase Dilt as
   needed for rate control
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will wean metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**] at 5 grams of amiodorone is in system
   (currently at 1600mg)
   -Re-start Asa and Plavix as patient is no longer CMO. Now DNR/DNI
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient febrile yesterday with rectal temp of
   almost 105.  Likely C Diff in this case, as patient with large smelly
   stool last evening.
   - Will pull femoral line today for comfort and for infection prevention
   - FU cultures
   - Continue fever treatments as needed with Tylenol and cooling blanket
   - Will send stool for C. diff and empirically start flagyl today
   .
   #Neuro Status: Sedation stopped ([**7-20**]). Pt appears to be slowly
   improving and more lucid with administration of morphine.
   - Follow neuro status
   # Left arm swelling
 possible DVT?
   - Will get left upper extremity swelling
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: 2 vessel disease s/p BMS to the mid LAD.
   - Have stopped Plavix 75 mg Daily, Simvastatin 80 mg daily, and ASA 325
   mg Daily
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg TID for rate control
   - Continue Captopril 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for blood pressure control
   .
   # Hypertension
 typically okay BP
s when not in respiratory distress,
   added Captopril yesterday.
   - will watch, possible increase in Captopril today in necessary and not
   improving with increased dose of Diltiazem
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved after 2L of D5W. Pt had a 4L Free Water
   deficit.
   - Have stopped labs and fluid repletion
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Patient recently on insulin drip, now fingersticks
   have stopped in light of goals of care.
   - since patient
s status is improving. Will give 20 units of NPH [**Hospital1 7**]
   and sliding scale QID fingersticks
   -if patients BS are reasonable level on this regimen, will cut back
   fingersticks
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE. Patient even over the last 24 hours. Dose
   not appear to be volume overloaded on exam.
   .
   # Anemia: Last Hct 27, stool guaiac positive.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Crt stable at 0.9. Most likely secondary to
   hypotension in setting of afib rvr.  FeUrea 8.16% is consistent with
   pre renal etiology..
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Lipid panel shows TC 157, TG: 156 HDL 30 LDLc 96; Not
   optimal HDL/LDL level
   - Have stopped zetia and simvastatin for now
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - have stopped Synthroid at 25 mcg daily
   # Depression:
   - Have stopped Paroxetine 10 mg daily, consider restarting in a few
   days if patient
   # GERD:
   -  Have stopped famotidine
   #Access: Femoral on left
   -pull line
   -attempt PIV, if not able will consider a PICC

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:  To my great surprise, patient
   survived acute respiratory decompensation without being intubated (she
   is dnr/dni).  In addition her cardiac rhythm has reverted out of a-fib
   to a-v paced, and she has defervesced.
   Her long term prognosis remains very poor, but now her short-term
   prognosis has just improved.  Therefore we will medically manage her in
   a conservative and noninvasive fashion.  She will remain dnr/dni but
   now we will get a palliative care/hodpice consult to attempt to
   discharge the patient from the hospital to some form of hospice care
   setting (either at home or in a nursing facility).
   Above discussed extensively with family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sarcoidosis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute heart failure and flash pulmonary edema. The patient had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension since admission. She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have two-vessel disease, for which she received bare metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. The patient was extubated and initially did well but experienced increased respiratory distress requiring treatment with morphine. She is currently intubated and on comfort measures only (CMO) status, with a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) order. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 104.8°F, blood pressure ranging from 143/62 mmHg to 180/82 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 60 to 129 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her physical examination reveals sclera anicteric, pupils equal and reactive bilaterally, supple neck, normal cardiac examination, coarse breath sounds bilaterally with expiratory wheezing, soft and obese abdomen without tenderness, and no lower extremity swelling.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sarcoidosis. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. She underwent a cardiac catheterization and was found to have 2-vessel disease, for which she received a bare metal stent in the left anterior descending artery. The patient was extubated two days ago but experienced increased respiratory distress yesterday, which improved with the administration of morphine. She is currently in sinus rhythm with a controlled heart rate and breathing comfortably.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had flash pulmonary edema and required intubation. Although she was extubated, she experienced increased respiratory distress due to comfort measures only (DNR/DNI). Close monitoring and titration of morphine drip as needed for respiratory distress and comfort are recommended.
2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rates in the 100s to 130s. Rate control is being managed with metoprolol and diltiazem. Amiodarone is also being continued for rhythm control.
3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient had a fever yesterday, likely due to Clostridium difficile infection. Cultures have been obtained, and fever treatments are being provided. The femoral line will be pulled for comfort"

   Chief Complaint: Intubated in CCU
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had full family meeting yesterday with her husband and multiple sons
   and daughters.  The family decided that their first priority is [** **]
   for the patient, and her code status was changed to DNR/DNI.  We
   initially continued to monitor her respiratory status with VBG
   However,  her PCO2 began to climb on her VBG and she appeared to be
   gasping for air and uncomfortable.  She was started on a morphine drip
   (initially at 1mg/hr).  After this, her respirations were much more
   unlabored, she converted to sinus rhythm with rates in the 60-70
s, and
   she was no longer hypertensive.
   - She also had high fevers throughout the day to 104.8, which broke
   with a cooling blanket, Tylenol, and morphine administration.
   - One episode of feeling pain and shortness of breath last evening,
   given 0.5mg Ativan IV which helped calm her down
   - She continues on medications for rate control/rhythm control, as well
   as for her breathing [** **].  Other medications were discontinued, as
   well blood draws.  The family decided against a new central line,
   femoral line was left in for now.
   - Left UE US showed no evidence of DVT on prelim read

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and sarcoidosis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute heart failure and flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been intubated and extubated, and is currently experiencing respiratory distress. She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has undergone a pacemaker placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60-70 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 143/62 mmHg to 180/82 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100%. She has a fever of 104.8 degrees Celsius, which was treated with a cooling blanket, Tylenol, and morphine. The patient's family has decided to pursue comfort care measures, and her code status has been changed to DNR/DNI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and history of flash pulmonary edema indicate a risk of recurrent respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of her respiratory status are essential.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff), especially considering the large smelly stool. Cultures should be obtained, and appropriate treatments should be initiated.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's left arm swelling raises the concern"

   Chief Complaint: Intubated in CCU
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had full family meeting yesterday with her husband and multiple sons
   and daughters.  The family decided that their first priority is comfort
   for the patient, and her code status was changed to DNR/DNI.  We
   initially continued to monitor her respiratory status with VBG
   However,  her PCO2 began to climb on her VBG and she appeared to be
   gasping for air and uncomfortable.  She was started on a morphine drip
   (initially at 1mg/hr).  After this, her respirations were much more
   unlabored, she converted to sinus rhythm with rates in the 60-70
s, and
   she was no longer hypertensive.
   - She also had high fevers throughout the day to 104.8, which broke
   with a cooling blanket, Tylenol, and morphine administration.
   - One episode of feeling pain and shortness of breath last evening,
   given 0.5mg Ativan IV which helped calm her down
   - She continues on medications for rate control/rhythm control, as well
   as for her breathing comfort.  Other medications were discontinued, as
   well blood draws.  The family decided against a new central line,
   femoral line was left in for now.
   - Left UE US showed no evidence of DVT on prelim read

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission. She was sent for cath and found to have 2 vessel disease,
   s/p BMS to LAD.  Now extubated and breathing comfortably with morphine
   administration.  She is in and out of Afib with rate 110-130, current
   in sinus or paced rhythm with rate 60-70. Currently status is DNR/DNI
   and not CMO
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension. Extubated two days ago with increased respiratory
   distress yesterday afternoon requiring treatment with morphine.  BiPap
   was an option yesterday afternoon but with family
s goals of care in
   mind, a morphine drip was started.
   - Doing well this morning with more comfortable breathing
   - Continue to titrate morphine drip as needed for respiratory distress;
   but will try to decrease morphine to improve wakefulness
   - Continue Xopenex/Iprotroprium nebs Q4Hours as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient now in sinus rhythm, recently in afib with rates in
   the 100s to 130s.
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg po TID; once she has 5 grams of amio, will
   cut back metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue Diltiazem 60mg QID, after 2 doses, will increase Dilt as
   needed for rate control
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will wean metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**] at 5 grams of amiodorone is in system
   (currently at 1600mg)
   -Re-start Asa and Plavix as patient is no longer CMO. Now DNR/DNI
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient febrile yesterday with rectal temp of
   almost 105.  Likely C Diff in this case, as patient with large smelly
   stool last evening.
   - Will pull femoral line today for comfort and for infection prevention
   - FU cultures
   - Continue fever treatments as needed with Tylenol and cooling blanket
   - Will send stool for C. diff and empirically start flagyl today
   .
   #Neuro Status: Sedation stopped ([**7-20**]). Pt appears to be slowly
   improving and more lucid with administration of morphine.
   - Follow neuro status
   # Left arm swelling
 possible DVT?
   - Will get left upper extremity swelling
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: 2 vessel disease s/p BMS to the mid LAD.
   - Have stopped Plavix 75 mg Daily, Simvastatin 80 mg daily, and ASA 325
   mg Daily
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg TID for rate control
   - Continue Captopril 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for blood pressure control
   .
   # Hypertension
 typically okay BP
s when not in respiratory distress,
   added Captopril yesterday.
   - will watch, possible increase in Captopril today in necessary and not
   improving with increased dose of Diltiazem
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved after 2L of D5W. Pt had a 4L Free Water
   deficit.
   - Have stopped labs and fluid repletion
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Patient recently on insulin drip, now fingersticks
   have stopped in light of goals of care.
   - since patient
s status is improving. Will give 20 units of NPH [**Hospital1 7**]
   and sliding scale QID fingersticks
   -if patients BS are reasonable level on this regimen, will cut back
   fingersticks
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE. Patient even over the last 24 hours. Dose
   not appear to be volume overloaded on exam.
   .
   # Anemia: Last Hct 27, stool guaiac positive.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Crt stable at 0.9. Most likely secondary to
   hypotension in setting of afib rvr.  FeUrea 8.16% is consistent with
   pre renal etiology..
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Lipid panel shows TC 157, TG: 156 HDL 30 LDLc 96; Not
   optimal HDL/LDL level
   - Have stopped zetia and simvastatin for now
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - have stopped Synthroid at 25 mcg daily
   # Depression:
   - Have stopped Paroxetine 10 mg daily, consider restarting in a few
   days if patient
   # GERD:
   -  Have stopped famotidine
   #Access: Femoral on left
   -pull line
   -attempt PIV, if not able will consider a PICC
   #Dispostion: patient wishes rehab

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sarcoidosis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. She has been intubated and extubated twice, with increased respiratory distress requiring treatment with morphine. The patient's current status is DNR/DNI and not CMO. She has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, anemia, acute renal failure, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism, depression, GERD, and possible DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema, which required intubation. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory distress and failure.
2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. There is a potential for recurrent episodes of AFib with RVR, which can lead to hemodynamic instability.
3. Infection: The patient has fever and leukocytosis, suggesting a possible infection. C. difficile infection is suspected, and empirical treatment with Flagyl has been started.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's left arm swelling may indicate a potential DVT. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: Patient stated several times
I want
   to die
.  Her respiratory status remains, as expected, highly tenuous.
   She is intermittently agitated.  She also appears slightly volume
   overloaded this morning.  We will give some furosemide to see if this
   improves patient comfort.  We will also administer morphine liberally
   to minimize respiratiory distress.  If respiratory status continues to
   deteriorate, a morphine infusion will be started with the understanding
   that this will represent the terminal intervention in her care.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   DNR status discussed. DNR.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, sarcoidosis, and coronary artery disease. She presented with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema and was found to have two-vessel disease, for which she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting of the left anterior descending artery.

The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response since admission. She was intubated and placed on BIPAP, but is now comfortable on 3 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. She appears to be fluid overloaded at this time.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 135/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face mask. Her current medication regimen includes metoprolol, diltiazem, amiodarone, aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, glargine insulin, and sliding scale insulin.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 26.9%, platelet count of 231 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 170 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Gave 1 unit of PRBC plus 20 mg IV lasix
   -Palliative Care consult: At this time it is difficult to assess her
   functional status as it appears to be rapidly changing. We will need to
   continue to monitor her progression as the sedation and opioids are
   being held. Would recommend continued orientation with television
   likes the Red Sox, and comfortable positions such as lying on her side
   while she sleeps. We will continue to follow with you and make
   recommendations as her clinical status continues to change
   - PO flaygl started b/c of concern for c. diff
   - FS QACHS, sliding scale insulin and 30 units of glargine
   - Femoral line in; PIV's attempted but failed, and s/p 1 unit of prbc
   and hct stabilizes...consider pulling femoral tomorrow without any iv
   access as patient does not really need IVs for meds.
   - Around 0030 patient with increasing wheezing on nebs and slighly
   agitated; saturating well with O2 sats in the mid to upper 90's on face
   mask. Gave 20 mg IV lasix and 1 mg morphine given earlier. Patient
   stabilized.

The patient underwent a pacemaker placement and percutaneous coronary intervention due to 2-vessel disease. She was extubated and breathing comfortably on a nasal cannula. However, she has had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension since admission.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation and BIPAP but is now comfortable on a 3L nasal cannula. There is concern for fluid overload.
2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has been in sinus rhythm but has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rates in the 100s to 130s. Medications include metoprolol, diltiazem, amiodarone, and consideration for weaning metoprolol.
3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient had high-grade fevers two days prior, which may be secondary to antibiotics or drugs. These resolved after stopping the medications. There is concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, especially with large smelly stools.
4. Neuro Status: The patient is currently completely interactive and appropriate.
5. Left Arm Swelling: No thrombus was identified on the left upper extremity ultrasound. Swelling"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Gave 1 unit of PRBC plus 20 mg IV lasix
   -Palliative Care consult: At this time it is difficult to assess her
   functional status as it appears to be rapidly changing. We will need to
   continue to monitor her progression as the sedation and opioids are
   being held. Would recommend continued orientation with television
   likes the Red Sox, and comfortable positions such as lying on her side
   while she sleeps. We will continue to follow with you and make
   recommendations as her clinical status continues to change
   - PO flaygl started b/c of concern for c. diff
   - FS QACHS, sliding scale insulin and 30 units of glargine
   - Femoral line in; PIV's attempted but failed, and s/p 1 unit of prbc
   and hct stabilizes...consider pulling femoral tomorrow without any iv
   access as patient does not really need IVs for meds.
   - Around 0030 patient with increasing wheezing on nebs and slighly
   agitated; saturating well with O2 sats in the mid to upper 90's on face

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission. She was sent for cath and found to have 2 vessel disease,
   s/p BMS to LAD.  Now extubated and breathing comfortably with morphine
   administration.  She is in and out of Afib with rate 110-130, current
   in sinus or paced rhythm with rate 60-70. Currently status is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: sp intubation and BIPAP. Now comfortable on 3L
   nasal cannula.
   - Continue to titrate morphine drip as needed for respiratory distress;
   but will try to decrease morphine to improve wakefulness
   - Continue Xopenex/Iprotroprium nebs Q4Hours as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient now in sinus rhythm, recently in afib with rates in
   the 100s to 130s.
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg po TID; once she has 5 grams of amio, will
   cut back metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue Diltiazem 60mg QID, after 2 doses, will increase Dilt as
   needed for rate control
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will wean metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**] at 5 grams of amiodorone is in system
   (currently at 1600mg)
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient febrile yesterday with rectal temp of
   almost 105.  Likely C Diff in this case, as patient with large smelly
   stool last evening.
   - Will pull femoral line today for comfort and for infection prevention
   - FU cultures
   - Continue fever treatments as needed with Tylenol and cooling blanket
   - Will send stool for C. diff and empirically start flagyl today
   .
   #Neuro Status: Currently completely interactive and appropriate.
   # Left arm swelling
 possible DVT?
   - Will get left upper extremity swelling
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: 2 vessel disease s/p BMS to the mid LAD.
   -  Plavix 75 mg Daily, Simvastatin 80 mg daily, and ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg TID for rate control
   - Continue Captopril 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for blood pressure control
   .
   # Hypertension
 typically okay BP
s when not in respiratory distress,
   added Captopril yesterday.
   - will watch, possible increase in Captopril today in necessary and not
   improving with increased dose of Diltiazem

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization and was found to have two-vessel disease, for which she received a bare-metal stent to the left anterior descending artery. She is now extubated and breathing comfortably with the administration of morphine. The patient's current rhythm is sinus, although she has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rates in the 100s to 130s. Her blood pressure is stable, but she has experienced hypotension since admission. The patient has been prescribed multiple medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, amiodarone, aspirin, Plavix, simvastatin, and captopril. She also has a diagnosis of anemia, sarcoidosis, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient's family wishes for her to go to rehab, but her medical condition requires palliative care, and she has chosen a DNR/DNI status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent history of respiratory distress and previous intubation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient's history of"
