","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history includes a fracture of the left hip, a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness and progressive lower extremity weakness, chronic viral hepatitis C, pleural effusion, impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, coagulopathy, and ascites.

The patient's current condition shows that they are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. They are sedated with propofol and analgesia with fentanyl. The patient has received blood products, including packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets, indicating a possible bleeding complication or coagulopathy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/46 mmHg to 122/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (44 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (7.4 g/dL), elevated blood glucose (102 mg/dL), elevated creatinine (1.1 mg/dL), and abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST: 12-7, Alk Phos/T Bili: 79/6.8). These findings suggest possible infection, anemia, hyperglycemia, renal dysfunction, and liver abnormalities.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who was admitted to the MICU from the PACU for hypotension. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic liver disease, a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right-sided weakness, and chronic renal insufficiency. He underwent an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a left femoral neck fracture yesterday and tolerated the procedure well.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, hematuria, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and impaired physical mobility. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute decompensation during the surgery. The patient's respiratory status has improved following a large volume thoracentesis. His liver function appears stable, but he is on the transplant list due to his Hepatitis C cirrhosis with a MELD score of 19.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. He has received blood products and coagulation factors post-operatively.

Plan:

The patient's plan includes ongoing monitoring of his respiratory status with a trial of pressure support and possible spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. He will be evaluated for extubation if the SBT is successful. The patient will continue to receive inotropic support as needed."

   # Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for surgery, but then acutely
   decompensated due to lateral decubitus position.  Could be [**3-14**] pleural
   effusion vs ET tube placement.  Improved s/p large volume
   thoracentesis.  Repeat CXR improved last evening on  mechanical
   ventilation. Had bronch.
   - Pressure Support trial this morning, doing well. Will try SBT and
   possible extubation today
   - Continue Ipratroprium Nebs
   - Follow-up IP recs if any (transudative effusion)
   - f/u BAL
   # Hypotension: On pressors while on vent. Had blood loss in OR. Tends
   to run low.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery for a left femoral neck fracture. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypotension following the surgery. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hematuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for surgery but then developed acute decompensation due to a lateral decubitus position. It could be either a pleural effusion or endotracheal tube placement. The patient improved after a large volume thoracentesis and repeat chest X-ray showed improvement on mechanical ventilation. Pressure support trial was done successfully, and the possibility of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation today is being considered.
2. Hypotension: The patient is on pressors while on ventilator due to blood loss during the surgery. He tends to run low on blood pressure and is receiving packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Diuretics are being held due to low pressures, and further evaluation of his biliary pressures is needed. Weaning of neo is planned as tolerated.
3. Left Femoral Head Fracture: The patient sustained a traumatic fracture while inpatient. He underwent OR"

   56-year-old man with cirrhosis admitted for dyspnea/pleural effusion
   and hematuria now POD1 s/p hip repair from fall.
   Respiratory failure
   Keep intubated while transfusing (large volume)
   Bronch showed no major endobronchial disease
 some B.I. malacia, some
   mucus.
   Hold off on further thoracentesis/paracentesis right now.
   Anemia / Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia
   Suspect this is related to blood loss with hip repair.  However,
   maintain vigilance for other bleeding sites
 place OG tube.
   Transfuse PRBCs, platelets, FFP.  Check fibrinogen, ionized calcium,
   etc.
   Discuss DVT prophylaxis with ortho (?hold, ?LMWH)
   Hypotension / Shock
   Actually seems centrally well perfused.  However, concerned that there
   may be some component of hypovolemia and we are transfusing
   aggressively.  No evidence of sepsis at this point.
   Cirrhosis
   Place OG and begin lactulose/rifaxamin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with cirrhosis admitted for dyspnea/pleural effusion and hematuria following a hip repair surgery. The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/50-122/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 535 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, warm skin, and normal neurologic function. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient will be kept intubated while transfusing large volumes. No major endobronchial disease was found during bronchoscopic examination.
2. Anemia, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia: This is suspected to be related to blood loss during the hip repair surgery. Vigilance for other bleeding sites is maintained"

   Respiratory failure
   Keep intubated while transfusing (large volume)
   Bronch showed no major endobronchial disease
 some B.I. malacia, some
   mucus.
   Hold off on further thoracentesis/paracentesis right now.
   Anemia / Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia
   Suspect this is related to blood loss with hip repair.  However,
   maintain vigilance for other bleeding sites
 place OG tube.
   Transfuse PRBCs, platelets, FFP.  Check fibrinogen, ionized calcium,
   etc.
   Discuss DVT prophylaxis with ortho (?hold, ?LMWH)
   Hypotension / Shock
   Actually seems centrally well perfused.  However, concerned that there
   may be some component of hypovolemia and we are transfusing
   aggressively.  No evidence of sepsis at this point.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis, admitted for dyspnea/pleural effusion and hematuria following hip repair surgery. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, shock, and other complications. The patient is intubated and receiving respiratory support, as well as large volume transfusion. He has anemia, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia, which are suspected to be related to blood loss during surgery. There is concern about hypovolemia and potential for further bleeding sites. The patient's hypotension and shock status indicate the need for aggressive fluid resuscitation. He also has chronic viral hepatitis and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right-sided weakness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and intubation, he is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis, and pneumothorax.
2. Bleeding Complications: Given the patient's thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and history of blood loss during surgery, there is a risk for further bleeding and hemorrhage.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cirrhosis and the presence of an indwelling arterial line and multi-lumen catheter increase the risk of bloodstream infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infection ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who is on the transplant list. He has been admitted to the ICU from the PACU for hypotension. The patient has a background of CVA with right-sided weakness, hypertension, progressive volume overload, worsening ascites, left-sided pleural effusion, and hematuria. He underwent paracentesis once, thoracentesis twice, and sustained a left femoral neck fracture after falling in the hospital. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is sedated.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, as indicated by improving gases and mentation. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and possible extubation may be considered today. The patient should continue receiving ipratropium nebs, follow up on intraprocedural recommendations, and have a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) done.

2. Hypotension: Despite receiving multiple blood transfusions, the patient remains hypotensive and on pressors while on ventilation. There is a possibility of ongoing blood loss into the hip, and the patient is receiving packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Diuretics should be held due to low pressures, and the liver team should be consulted regarding the patient's biliary pressures. Neo should be weaned as tolerated.

3. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia exacerbated by"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M c Hep C cirrhosis on tx list, h/o CVA with R-sided weakness,
   HTN p/w progressive volume overload, worsening ascites, L-sided pleural
   effusion, and hematuria; s/p paracentesis x 1, thoracentesis x 2 with
   in-hospital fall with subsequent L femoral neck fracture; admitted now
   to MICU from PACU for hypotension.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for surgery, but then acutely
   decompensated due to lateral decubitus position.  Could be [**3-14**] pleural
   effusion vs ET tube placement.  Improved s/p large volume
   thoracentesis.  Repeat CXR improved last evening on  mechanical
   ventilation. Had bronch.
   - Pressure Support trial this morning, doing well. Will try SBT and
   possible extubation today
   - Continue Ipratroprium Nebs
   - Follow-up IP recs if any (transudative effusion)
   - f/u BAL
   # Hypotension: On pressors while on vent. Had blood loss in OR. Tends
   to run low.
   - receiving pRBCs
   - Hold diuretics given low pressures
   - touch base with liver team re his b/l pressures
   - wean neo as tolerated
   .
   # L femoral head fracture: Patient with traumatic fracture while
   inpatient.  Patient CP class C and a high operative risk for a high
   risk procedure.  Patient underwent ORIF yesterday and tolerated well.
    - Follow-up orthopedic recs
   # Hep C cirrhosis - MELD 19 on admission
 24 today. Patient on
   transplant list. No suspicion for SBP at this time given lack of
   abdominal pain and/or fevers.
   - liver function appears stable at this time. Slight bump in TBili
   likely in setting of surgery, continued liver disease. Will follow
   - Trend MELD labs daily
   - Restarted cipro for SBP ppx post-operatively
   - Cannot get lactulose, rifaximin while intubated, unless we drop NG
   tube. Has risks (known varices) but we should have gastric access
   - Hold lasix, aldactone, nadolol for now given intubation, will likely
   restart when extubated and pressures stable
   .
   # Hematuria - Resolving spontaneously with no evidence of obstruction
   or clots. Hct 33.3 on admission, stable from Hct checked 3-4 weeks ago.
   Initially suspected to be spontaneous bleed in setting of
   thrombocytopenia / coagulopathy [**3-14**] cirrhosis.
   - CBI / 3 way Foley if evidence of obstruction/clots
   - trend Hct q6hours post-operatively
   - Continue active type and screen
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelet 39 on admission, 44 today. Likely [**3-14**]
   hepatic dysfunction.  Transfused platelets while inpatient, unclear if
   became more hypoxic immediately following transfusion. Received one
   unit platelets yesterday and another post-operatively today
    - Continue to monitor
   - Platelet transfusions and vitamin K, FFP
    - Review records for transfusion reaction.
   .
   # Anemia
 Chronic anemia but also post-op, has esophageal varices. Hct
   20.1 this AM.
    - Monitor closely post-op Q6H Hct given coagulopathy
 likely q8h
   today
    - Active T&S
   - getting 1 unit pRBCs this morning for post-op losses, pressor demand,
   will continue to replete to hct of 30
   - check for DIC
   - place OG for nutrition, for lavage to r/o UGIB in setting of dropping
   hct
   # Hematuria: His presenting complaint, now resolved.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by complications such as a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right-sided weakness, hypertension, progressive volume overload, worsening ascites, left-sided pleural effusion, and hematuria. The patient underwent surgery and subsequently developed respiratory failure due to lateral decubitus position, which may have been caused by either pleural effusion or endotracheal tube placement. The patient also experienced hypotension post-surgery, likely due to blood loss, and required vasopressors for blood pressure support. Additionally, the patient sustained a left femoral neck fracture while inpatient and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery, which was well-tolerated. The patient has a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis with a MELD score of 19 on admission and is currently on the transplant list. The patient is also at high risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) but currently shows no signs or symptoms of infection. The patient has chronic anemia and is receiving packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for post-operative losses and pressor demand. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to hepatic dysfunction and has been managed with platelet transfusions. The patient's hematuria has resolved spontaneously without evidence of obstruction or clots. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who was admitted to the MICU from the PACU for hypotension. He has several medical issues including respiratory failure, hypotension, a left femoral neck fracture, and chronic anemia. The patient underwent orthopedic surgery for the fracture and tolerated it well.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for surgery but then experienced acute decompensation possibly due to lateral decubitus position or pleural effusion. His condition improved after a large volume thoracentesis and mechanical ventilation. A bronchoscopy was performed, and he may undergo a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) today with the possibility of extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient is on pressors while on ventilation due to blood loss during surgery. He is receiving packed red blood cells (pRBCs) to maintain adequate blood pressure. Diuretics are being held due to low pressures, and the liver team needs to be consulted regarding his biliary pressures. Neo (a medication) will be weaned as tolerated.
3. Left Femoral Head Fracture: The patient sustained a traumatic fracture while inpatient and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) yesterday, which he tolerated well. Follow-up orthopedic recommendations will be implemented.
4. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: The patient has a"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who is on the transplant list. He has a past medical history of CVA with right-sided weakness, hypertension, progressive volume overload, worsening ascites, left-sided pleural effusion, and hematuria. The patient underwent paracentesis once, thoracentesis twice, and had an in-hospital fall with subsequent left femoral neck fracture. He was admitted to the MICU from the PACU for hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, left femoral head fracture, Hepatitis C cirrhosis with increased MELD score, thrombocytopenia, fibrinogenemia, and hematuria. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions due to blood loss during surgery and ongoing bleeding into the hip. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if not closely monitored and managed, further hypotension if blood loss continues or if pressor support is not maintained, worsening anemia if bleeding continues, complications related to the left femoral head fracture such as non-union or infection, progression of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and increased MELD score leading to liver failure, worsening thrombocytopenia if platelet transfusions are not continued, and potential complications related to fibrinogenemia such as excessive bleeding.

The patient's treatment plan includes ongoing respiratory support, continuation"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M c Hep C cirrhosis on tx list, h/o CVA with R-sided weakness,
   HTN p/w progressive volume overload, worsening ascites, L-sided pleural
   effusion, and hematuria; s/p paracentesis x 1, thoracentesis x 2 with
   in-hospital fall with subsequent L femoral neck fracture; admitted now
   to MICU from PACU for hypotension.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Improving gases and mentation. Extubated
   yesterday without issues. TRALI unlikely given symptoms present before
   transfusions. Aspiration also a concern given patient pulling out NG
   tube yesterday.
   - Continue Ipratroprium & albuterol Nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   - f/u BAL
   - NG tube in place and tolerating tube feeds
   - ECG to evaluate for cardiac ischemia
   - Diuresis w/ lasix 60 IV bolus x1
   - Consider paracentesis if ascites visualizable with U/S
   # Hypotension: Resolved, off pressors.
   - starting diuretics as above
   .
   # Anemia
 Chronic anemia but also post-op w/EBL 1,500, has esophageal
   varices. Could be bleeding into hip. No transfusions required
   yesterday. Hemolysis apparent on labs
   - Q8H Hct
   - Active T&S
   - continue to replete to hct of 30
   # L femoral head fracture: Patient with traumatic fracture while
   inpatient.  Patient CP class C and a high operative risk for a high
   risk procedure.  Patient underwent ORIF and tolerated well.
    - Follow-up orthopedic recs
   # Hep C cirrhosis - MELD 19 on admission, 21 today. No suspicion for
   SBP at this time given lack of abdominal pain and/or fevers.  Slight
   bump in TBili likely in setting of surgery, continued liver disease,
   multiple transfusions.
   - fractionated Bili and haptoglobin suggestive of hemolysis, fibrinogen
   suggestive of low-grade DIC
 not uncommon in liver patients; continue
   to monitor
   - Trend MELD labs daily
   - Restarted cipro for SBP ppx post-operatively
   - Restart his PO meds lactulose, rifaximin and aggressive high calorie
   tube feeds
   - Hold aldactone, nadolol for now, given blood pressures
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelet 44-> 53 today s/p 2 transfusions. Likely
   [**3-14**] hepatic dysfunction. Receiving plt transfusion today
   - Continue to monitor
   - Platelet transfusions to target of >50, will transfuse again this
   morning
   .
   # Fibrinogenemia
 150. If remains low, needs cryo.
   .
   # Hematuria: His presenting complaint. Should pursue outpatient urology
   evaluation
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who was admitted to the MICU for hypotension. He has a past medical history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with right-sided weakness, hypertension, progressive volume overload, worsening ascites, left-sided pleural effusion, and hematuria. The patient underwent paracentesis once, thoracentesis twice, and had an in-hospital fall resulting in a left femoral neck fracture. He was intubated but successfully extubated yesterday without any issues.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/54 mmHg to 147/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 638 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system is clear bilaterally without any wheezes or crackles.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetrical chest expansion, and clear breath sounds. There is also evidence of right and left lower extremity edema. Neurologic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis who has been admitted to the MICU for hypotension. He has several medical complications and comorbidities, including chronic anemia, hypotension, a left femoral neck fracture, hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, fibrinogenemia, hematuria, malnutrition, and impaired physical mobility.

The patient's recent events include being intubated due to respiratory failure but was successfully extubated without issues. He underwent an orotracheal intubation (OTI) and mechanical ventilation (MV) for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient also received packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions to address his anemia and coagulopathy.

The patient has a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, which has led to complications such as portal hypertension and esophageal varices. He is currently on the transplant list for liver transplantation.

The patient's current vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. His temperature is slightly elevated. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, edema in both lower extremities, and soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hematocrit (H"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who presented with progressive volume overload, worsening ascites, left-sided pleural effusion, and hematuria. He had a fall while in the hospital, resulting in a left femoral neck fracture, for which he underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). He is currently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to hypotension.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, as indicated by improving gases and mentation. Diuretics were administered, and the patient is tolerating tube feeds.
2. Left femoral head fracture: The patient sustained a traumatic fracture while inpatient. Due to his high operative risk, he underwent ORIF, which he tolerated well. Follow-up orthopedic recommendations include aiming for a hematocrit (Hct) greater than 30 and an International Normalized Ratio (INR) close to 1.5.
3. Hepatitis C cirrhosis: The patient's MELD score has increased from 19 to 20, indicating a higher mortality risk. No suspicion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is present at this time. The patient's bilirubin levels are fractionated, suggestive of hemolysis, and fibrinogen levels are suggestive of low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation ("

   progressive volume overload, worsening ascites, L-sided pleural
   effusion, and hematuria; s/p paracentesis x 1, thoracentesis x 2 with
   in-hospital fall with subsequent L femoral neck fracture; admitted now
   to MICU from PACU for hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure: Improving gases and mentation. Diuresed 2 L off
   with Spironolactone 200 mg PO QD, Lasix 60 mg IV yesterday x 2, this AM
   x 1.
   - PM lytes for aggressive diuresis
   - Continue Ipratroprium & albuterol Nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   - f/u BAL
   - NG tube in place and tolerating tube feeds
   - Consider paracentesis if ascites visualizable with U/S
   # Leukopenia: Drifting down. Add diff to AM.
   # Anemia
 Chronic anemia but also post-op w/EBL 1,500, has esophageal
   varices. No transfusions required x 2 days. Hemolysis apparent on labs.
   Crit stable.
   - hct QS
   - Active T&S
   # L femoral head fracture: Patient with traumatic fracture while
   inpatient.  Patient CP class C and a high operative risk for a high
   risk procedure.  Patient underwent ORIF and tolerated well.
    - Follow-up orthopedic recs
   # Hep C cirrhosis - MELD 19 on admission, 20 today (25% of 90-day
   mortality). No suspicion for SBP at this time given lack of abdominal
   pain and/or fevers.  Slight bump in TBili likely in setting of surgery,
   continued liver disease, multiple transfusions.
   - fractionated Bili and haptoglobin suggestive of hemolysis, fibrinogen
   suggestive of low-grade DIC -- not uncommon in liver patients; continue
   to monitor
   - Trend MELD labs daily
   - Restarted cipro for SBP ppx post-operatively, Day 4
   - Restart his PO meds lactulose, rifaximin and aggressive high calorie
   tube feeds
   - Hold aldactone, nadolol for now, given blood pressures
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets transfused -> Platelets 26 -> 1 unit
   platelets -> 37, bumped 11 (so not refractory), this AM down to 31.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who is on the transplant list. He has had several complications including a fall resulting in a left femoral neck fracture, respiratory failure, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hematuria. The patient underwent orthopedic surgery for the fracture and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient had worsening pleural effusion and required thoracentesis. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, which may increase the risk of infection. Active tissue surveillance and monitoring for signs of infection are important.
3. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia likely due to chronic blood loss from esophageal varices. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and transfusing as needed are necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can lead to bleeding complications. Monitoring platelet levels and considering platelet transfusions are important.
5. Fibrinogenemia: The patient's fibrinogen level is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring fibrinogen levels and considering cryoprecipitate transfusion if low are necessary.
6. Hematuria: The patient presented with hematuria, which requires further evaluation by urology"
