   hypokalemia, hyponatremia and three witnessed GTC seizures.
   > Seizures: seems most likely [**1-20**] hyponatremia (see below) vs EtOH
   withdrawl as her EtOh consumption is not clear.  Head CT was
   unremarkable. No further seizure activity.
   - Monitor for EtOH withdrawl (CIWA protocol)
   - Cont to follow clinical exams.
   - thiamine and folate
    > Hyponatremia: hypovolemic, hyponatremia with good response to fluid
   challenge
    > Hypokalemia: in the setting of metabolic alkalosis: likely in the
   setting of profound contraction alkalosis. Continue to replete K and Cl
   as well as volume repletion, would favor using KCL IV and continue to
   run volume goal of I/O

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, uncertain EtOH abuse, and prior intravenous drug use. She presented with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. 

The assessment and plan include monitoring for alcohol withdrawal (CIWA protocol), continuing to follow clinical exams, administering thiamine and folate, addressing hyponatremia, hypokalemia, pancreatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and liver disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pancreatitis, seizures due to electrolyte imbalances or alcohol withdrawal, further development of DIC, worsening of liver disease, and potential infections due to prolonged immobilization."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, possible EtOH abuse, and prior intravenous drug use. She presents with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure of 95/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Her physical examination reveals scleral icterus, diminished breath sounds at the bases of the lungs, a distended abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low potassium and sodium levels, and evidence of DIC. 

The patient's assessment includes prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, seizures, potential alcohol withdrawal, hypovolemic hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, obstructed biliary pattern (possibly due to gallstones or EtOH abuse), and evidence of DIC likely secondary to pancreatitis.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, possible EtOH abuse, and prior intravenous drug use.
- She presented with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
- The head CT was unremarkable, and no further seizure activity has been observed.
- The patient is being monitored for EtOH withdrawal using the CIWA protocol.
- She has hypovolemic hyponatremia, which responded well to fluid challenge.
- Hypokalemia is likely due to profound contraction alkalosis, and potassium and chloride repletion, as well as volume repletion, are ongoing.
- The patient has obstructed biliary pancreatitis, possibly related to gallstones or EtOH abuse. A hepatology consult has been requested, and an MRCP is planned.
- The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving IV fluids.
- There is evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) on initial lab panels, likely secondary to pancreatitis. The DIC is slowly improving.
- The patient has chronic liver disease, and follow-up Hep serologies and MRCP are needed.
- Additional issues noted by the ICU resident include nutrition, glycemic control, and lines management.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with boots and subcut"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and prior intravenous drug use. She presents with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 95/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted seizures.

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral edema and icterus, normocephalic head, diminished breath sounds at the bases, soft non-tender abdomen with distention, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8-6.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 76-87 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 85-117 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes such as ALT/AST and alkaline phosphatase. Other lab values indicate hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and elevated lactate levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, possible EtOH abuse, and prior intravenous drug use. She presented with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, tachycardia, respiratory distress, and evidence of multiorgan dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has already experienced three witnessed GTC seizures, and it is important to monitor for any further seizure activity.
2. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's history of possible EtOH abuse raises the concern for ethanol withdrawal, and appropriate monitoring and treatment should be initiated.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of hepatitis C and current liver dysfunction, hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication that needs to be closely monitored.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's hyponatremia and hypokalemia suggest possible renal involvement, and ongoing monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Infection: With multiorgan dysfunction, the patient is at increased risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which can"

   prolonged poor po intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia,
   hyponatremia and three witnessed GTC seizures
 H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
    Seizures: most likely related to alcohol withdrawal, but also can be
   attributed to multiple electrolyte abnormalities.  She did receive
   benzodiazepines and fosphenytoin in the OSH ED. CT head without lesion
   --CIWA scale, standing diazepam for now.  Will not continue
   antiepileptic at this time
   --Electrolyte repletion.
   --Noncontrast CT head negative for mass lesion
   --Seizure precautions
   -- Thiamine, Folate, MVI
   2. Pancreatitis:  Most likely alcoholic pancreatitis.  Although no
   biliary dilation or stone seen on RUQ ultrasound, her LFT pattern is
   primarily obstructive, cannot r/o gallstone.
   --MRCP done this morning-result pending
   --NPO, IVF (maintenance for now)
   --Antiemetics as needed, pain control as needed.
   3. Hyponatremia: corrected with volume resuscitation. Rate of
   correction suggests acute drop, which  may have contributed to seizure
   4. Hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis:  from significant
   vomiting
   --Antiemetics
   --electrolyte repletion
   --due to profound contraction metabolic alkalosis, remains hypokalemic.
   5. Abnormal LFTs: history of hepatitis C infection and either hepatitis
   A or B (she is unsure).  Ultrasound consistent with fatty liver.  She
   has a mild transaminitis, with a prominent elevated TB/DB consistent
   with obstruction.   She has thrombocytopenia and a mildly elevated
   INR.
   --Appreciate liver evaluation
   --F/u MRCP results
   --Follow up multiple serologies to better identify underlying liver
   disease
   6. IVDU: on methadone. Call into her methadone program and message left
   to confirm--[**Location (un) **] public health commission.  She reports a dose of 65
   mg, roommate reports 40 mg.
   --Dose of 65 mg confirmed, but patient with long QTc
   --MS Contin standing for now until QTc normalizes.
   7. TCP/Low fibrinogen/Elev coags: concerning for DIC. Will trend, cryo
   if fibrinogen <100.  Have been stable to date.
   8. Long QTc: holding the methadone and repleting electrolytes. Recheck
   ECG once electrolytes have normalized prior to restarting methadone
   FEN: significant electrolyte abnormalities.  Frequent lyte checks. Has
   received 180 mEq of potassium to date.  Change to NS at 150 cc/hr for
   now. NPO until after MRCP interpretation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and prior intravenous drug use. She presents with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The patient's seizures are most likely related to alcohol withdrawal and electrolyte abnormalities. She received benzodiazepines and fosphenytoin in the emergency department.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Seizures: The patient likely had seizures due to alcohol withdrawal and electrolyte imbalances. She was given benzodiazepines and fosphenytoin. Continuous monitoring for seizures is recommended, and diazepam is being used for seizure prophylaxis.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient likely has alcoholic pancreatitis. Further evaluation with an MRCP is needed to rule out gallstones. She is NPO, receiving IV fluids, and receiving antiemetics and pain control as needed.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia was corrected with volume resuscitation. It is important to monitor her sodium levels closely.
4. Hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis: This condition is likely due to significant vomiting. The patient will receive antiemetics and electrolyte repletion.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 y.o. F with a history of hepatitis C and prior IVDU presenting with
   prolonged poor po intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia,
   hyponatremia and three witnessed GTC seizures.
   1. Pancreatitis:  Most likely alcoholic pancreatitis.  Although no
   biliary dilation or stone seen on RUQ ultrasound, her LFT pattern is
   primarily obstructive.  MRCP negative.
   --send Triglycerides today for etiology of pancreatitis
   --ADAT (on soft)
   --complete 1 L IVF today
   --Antiemetics as needed, pain control as needed
   --no need for steroids as discriminant function low
   2. Seizures: most likely related to alcohol withdrawal, but also can be
   attributed to multiple electrolyte abnormalities.  She did receive
   benzodiazepines and fosphenytoin in the OSH ED. CT head without lesion
   --CIWA scale, standing diazepam 10 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Will not continue
   antiepileptic at this time.
   --Electrolyte repletion
   --Seizure precautions
   --Thiamine, Folate, MVI
   3. Hyponatremia: corrected with volume resuscitation. Rate of
   correction suggests acute drop, which  may have contributed to seizure
   4. Hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis:  from significant
   vomiting, resolving
   --Antiemetics
   --electrolyte repletion
   5. Hepatitis C/Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Ultrasound consistent with fatty
   liver.  She has a mild transaminitis, with a prominent elevated TB/DB
   consistent with obstruction.   She has thrombocytopenia and a mildly
   elevated INR.
   --Appreciate liver evaluation: will set up with liver f/u in 6 weeks
   --Follow up multiple serologies to better identify underlying liver
   disease
   6. IVDU: on methadone. Call into her methadone program and message left
   to confirm--[**Location (un) **] public health commission.  She reports a dose of 65
   mg, roommate reports 40 mg.
   --EKG tomorrow
   --if QTC normal, start methadone tomorrow AM
   --SW consult
   7. TCP/Low fibrinogen/Elev coags: no longer c/w DIC. No longer needing
   to  monitor.
   8. Long QTc: holding the methadone and repleting electrolytes. Recheck
   ECG tomorrow once electrolytes have normalized prior to restarting
   methadone

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and intravenous drug use, presenting with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She has been diagnosed with alcoholic pancreatitis and alcoholic hepatitis, and her liver function tests indicate an obstructive pattern. The patient's electrolyte imbalances have been corrected, and she has received treatment for seizures. She also has thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and an increased INR, suggesting liver dysfunction. An MRCP was performed, which showed no biliary ductal abnormalities and fluid around the pancreatic tail consistent with pancreatitis. The patient's condition is stable, and she is being monitored closely in the ICU. Potential medical complications include ongoing pancreatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis, multiorgan failure, and complications related to her history of intravenous drug use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing pancreatitis: The patient has fluid around the pancreatic tail, suggesting recent prior pancreatitis. There is also no biliary dilation or stone seen on RUQ ultrasound, which may indicate alcoholic pancreatitis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and increased INR could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease.
3. Sepsis: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77.6 kg, 100.7°F male with a history of likely alcoholic hepatitis, pancreatitis, and fluid around the pancreatic tail. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and mild fever. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a negative central venous pressure (CVP), indicating poor perfusion. Fluid balance shows an overall deficit of 265 mL since midnight. Respiratory support is not required, and the patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 99%. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, deranged coagulation profile, and abnormal renal function tests. Blood cultures were sent due to the patient's fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's fever, hypotension, and tachycardia may indicate an ongoing infection, which could progress to septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine levels and urea nitrogen suggest potential renal impairment, which could worsen if fluid balance is not corrected.
3. Coagulopathy: The deranged coagulation profile (PTT, INR) and low fibrinogen level indicate a risk of bleeding complications.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis raises the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status or neurologic changes.
5. Pancre"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 y.o. F with a history of hepatitis C and prior IVDU presenting with
   prolonged poor po intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia,
   hyponatremia and three witnessed GTC seizures
 H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
    Seizures: most likely related to alcohol withdrawal, but also can be
   attributed to multiple electrolyte abnormalities.  She did receive
   benzodiazepines and fosphenytoin in the OSH ED. CT head without lesion
   --CIWA scale, standing diazepam for now.  Will not continue
   antiepileptic at this time
   --Electrolyte repletion.
   --Noncontrast CT head negative for mass lesion
   --Seizure precautions
   -- Thiamine, Folate, MVI
   2. Pancreatitis:  Most likely alcoholic pancreatitis.  Although no
   biliary dilation or stone seen on RUQ ultrasound, her LFT pattern is
   primarily obstructive, cannot r/o gallstone.
   --MRCP done this morning-result pending
   --NPO, IVF (maintenance for now)
   --Antiemetics as needed, pain control as needed.
   3. Hyponatremia: corrected with volume resuscitation. Rate of
   correction suggests acute drop, which  may have contributed to seizure
   4. Hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis:  from significant
   vomiting
   --Antiemetics
   --electrolyte repletion
   --due to profound contraction metabolic alkalosis, remains hypokalemic.
   5. Abnormal LFTs: history of hepatitis C infection and either hepatitis
   A or B (she is unsure).  Ultrasound consistent with fatty liver.  She
   has a mild transaminitis, with a prominent elevated TB/DB consistent
   with obstruction.   She has thrombocytopenia and a mildly elevated
   INR.
   --Appreciate liver evaluation
   --F/u MRCP results
   --Follow up multiple serologies to better identify underlying liver
   disease
   6. IVDU: on methadone. Call into her methadone program and message left
   to confirm--[**Location (un) **] public health commission.  She reports a dose of 65
   mg, roommate reports 40 mg.
   --Dose of 65 mg confirmed, but patient with long QTc
   --MS Contin standing for now until QTc normalizes.
   7. TCP/Low fibrinogen/Elev coags: concerning for DIC. Will trend, cryo
   if fibrinogen <100.  Have been stable to date.
   8. Long QTc: holding the methadone and repleting electrolytes. Recheck
   ECG once electrolytes have normalized prior to restarting methadone
   FEN: significant electrolyte abnormalities.  Frequent lyte checks. Has
   received 180 mEq of potassium to date.  Change to NS at 150 cc/hr for
   now. NPO until after MRCP interpretation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and prior intravenous drug use. She presents with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, likely alcoholic pancreatitis, and her liver function tests show an obstructive pattern that cannot be ruled out for gallstone disease. An MRCP was done to further evaluate this. She is currently on NPO status with maintenance IV fluids.

The patient also has hyponatremia, which was corrected with volume resuscitation. This may have contributed to the seizure. She also has hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to significant vomiting. Electrolyte repletion is ongoing.

Abnormal liver function tests are seen in the patient, with a history of hepatitis C infection and either hepatitis A or B. An ultrasound is consistent with fatty liver. Thrombocytopenia and a mildly elevated INR are also present.

The patient's history of intravenous drug use is noted, and she is currently on methadone. A confirmation call will be made to her methadone program, as she reports a dose of 65 mg, while her roommate reports 40 mg. MS Contin will be held until the QTc normalizes.

","The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, possible EtOH abuse, and prior intravenous drug use. She presents with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The head CT was unremarkable, and no further seizure activity has been observed.

The patient is being monitored for alcohol withdrawal using the CIWA protocol and continues to have clinical exams. Thiamine and folate supplementation are also being administered.

The hyponatremia is considered hypovolemic and responded well to fluid challenge. The hypokalemia is believed to be in the setting of metabolic alkalosis, likely due to profound contraction alkalosis. Aggressive potassium and chloride repletion, as well as volume repletion, are recommended. The goal is to trend K and continue with aggressive repletion.

Pancreatitis is suspected, possibly due to an obstructed biliary pattern (unclear if it's gallstones or EtOH-related). Hepatology consultation is being sought, and an MRCP is pending. The patient is currently NPO, allowed to have ice chips, receiving IV fluids as previously mentioned, and no empiric antibiotics are being given.

There is evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) on initial lab panels, likely secondary to pancreatitis. These lab abnormalities are slowly improving, and continued monitoring is advised.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, uncertain EtOH abuse, and prior IVDU.
- She presented with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures.
- The patient's seizures may be attributed to hyponatremia or EtOH withdrawal, but further investigation is needed.
- Head CT results were unremarkable, and there has been no additional seizure activity.
- The patient requires monitoring for EtOH withdrawal using the CIWA protocol and supplementation with thiamine and folate.
- Methadone should be administered cautiously due to the potential for QT prolongation and electrolyte imbalances.
- Hyponatremia is likely hypovolemic and responded well to fluid challenge.
- Hypokalemia may be caused by profound contraction alkalosis, and aggressive potassium repletion is necessary.
- Pancreatitis appears to be obstructive in nature, possibly due to gallstones or EtOH consumption.
- There are no signs of infection that warrant empiric antibiotic therapy.
- Evidence suggests disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to pancreatitis, which is slowly improving.
- The patient has liver disease related to hepatitis C and alcoholic hepatitis, for which specific treatment is not indicated at this time.
- Additional recommendations include outpatient Hep B vaccination, outpatient liver follow"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, possible EtOH abuse, and prior IVDU. She presented with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has experienced three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Further evaluation and management of seizures should be continued, considering both hyponatremia and possible ethanol withdrawal as potential causes.
2. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient's history of possible EtOH abuse raises concerns for ethanol withdrawal. Monitoring for withdrawal symptoms and initiating appropriate treatment, such as the CIWA protocol, is recommended.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which needs to be corrected carefully to prevent further neurological complications. Close monitoring of sodium levels and appropriate fluid management should be implemented.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient also has hypokalemia, which may be associated with metabolic alkalosis. Repletion of potassium and chloride should continue, along with volume repletion. Using potassium chloride IV and maintaining a goal of balanced I/O is advised.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, likely due to an obstructed biliary pattern. Continued monitoring and management of pancreatitis are necessary, including dietary advancement"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, possible alcohol abuse, and prior intravenous drug use. She presented with prolonged poor oral intake, pancreatitis, jaundice, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and three witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60/51 mmHg to 129/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and has not been assessed for neurologic status.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit and platelet count, increased creatinine level, and altered liver function tests. The patient's urine examination reveals the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, and yeast. The abdominal X-ray shows fluid adjacent to the pancreatic tail, likely due to recent pancreatitis. The MRCP also shows diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver and fluid around the pancreatic tail.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Seizures: The patient's seizures may be attributed to hyponatremia or ethanol withdrawal. The head CT was unremarkable, and there has been no further seizure activity.
   - Monitor for ethanol withdrawal using the CIWA protocol.
   - Administer thiamine and folate.
   - Restart"
