   and small on the left.
   3. Considerable increased consolidation of the right lower lobe, with
   scattered ground glass opacities in other lobes bilaterally, suggesting
   pneumonia.
   4. Unchanged right anterior fifth rib fracture and multilevel thoracic
   vertebral body compression deformities.
   CXR (my read):
   -endotracheal tube in place
   -worsening right sided pleural effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Most likely etiology is mucous plugging,
   pleural effusion and right lower lobe collapse as seen on CTA.  Imaging
   not consistent with pulmonary embolism.  No significant pulmonary edema
   appreciated on chest CT concerning for cardiac etiology and EKG is not
   concerning for ischemia.  Elevated WBC count in this setting concerning
   for overlying infection. Patient now intubated nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen as tolerated for target oxygen saturations > 92%
   -> repeat ABG, decr driving pressure, decr pressure support
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis
   Septic Shock:  Patient afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and
   leukocytosis.  Patient developed hypotension on the floor to 80s
   systolic, now exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating
   medications.  Hypotension is refractory to fluid boluses and currently
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - currently on levophed (0.02) -> will wean as tolerated
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units prbcs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will hold on central line for now given PICC line available for
   pressors and adequate peripheral access
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will trend lactate
   Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  Initial plan was to
   start chemotherapy today.  He is s/p three days of high dose
   dexamethasone in anticipation.  Now course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure.
   - oncology to continue to follow in [**Last Name (LF) 1**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to reassess plans
   for chemotherapy
   Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of ileostomy with possible nutritional
   deficiencies.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   3. Considerable increased consolidation of the right lower lobe, with
   scattered ground glass opacities in other lobes bilaterally, suggesting
   pneumonia.
   4. Unchanged right anterior fifth rib fracture and multilevel thoracic

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Most likely etiology is mucous plugging,
   pleural effusion and right lower lobe collapse as seen on CTA.  Imaging
   not consistent with pulmonary embolism.  No significant pulmonary edema
   appreciated on chest CT concerning for cardiac etiology and EKG is not
   concerning for ischemia.  Rising WBC count in this setting concerning
   for overlying infection. Anesthesia and ENT consulted immediately on
   arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen as tolerated for target oxygen saturations > 92%
   -> repeat ABG, decr driving pressure, decr pressure support
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis
   Septic Shock:  Patient afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and
   leukocytosis.  Patient developed hypotension on the floor to 80s
   systolic, now exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating
   medications.  Hypotension is refractory to fluid boluses and currently
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - currently on levophed (0.02) -> will wean as tolerated
   - ScVO2  was low yesterday at 35, was transfused 2 units prbcs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will hold on central line for now given PICC line available for
   pressors and adequate peripheral access
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - followup blood, [**Hospital Unit Name **], sputum, and stool cultures
   - will trend lactate
   Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome
   - nutrition consult
   Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  Initial plan was to
   start chemotherapy today.  He is s/p three days of high dose
   dexamethasone in anticipation.  Now course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure.
   - oncology to continue to follow in [**Last Name (LF) 1**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to reassess plans
   for chemotherapy
   Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of ileostomy with possible nutritional
   deficiencies.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - iron studies, B12, folate, reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, biliribin
   were done -> not in DIC, not hemolyzing, poor marrow production
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Most likely etiology is mucous plugging,
   pleural effusion and right lower lobe collapse as seen on CTA.  Imaging
   not consistent with pulmonary embolism.  No significant pulmonary edema
   appreciated on chest CT concerning for cardiac etiology and EKG is not
   concerning for ischemia.  Elevated WBC count in this setting concerning
   for overlying infection. Patient now intubated nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen as tolerated for target oxygen saturations > 92%
   -> repeat ABG, decr driving pressure, decr pressure support
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis
   Septic Shock:  Patient afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and
   leukocytosis.  Patient developed hypotension on the floor to 80s
   systolic, now exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating
   medications.  Hypotension is refractory to fluid boluses and currently
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - currently on levophed (0.02) -> will wean as tolerated
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units prbcs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will hold on central line for now given PICC line available for
   pressors and adequate peripheral access
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will trend lactate
   Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 105/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has been intubated nasotracheally and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 123. The chest CT scan reveals considerable consolidation of the right lower lobe, suggesting pneumonia, and increased bilateral pleural effusions. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19.6 K/uL, an elevated CRP level of 30.3 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mEq/L. 

The patient's medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure due to mucous plugging and right lower lobe collapse, septic shock likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia, malnutrition, squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue, anion gap acidosis (resolved),"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of the oropharynx and tongue. He was admitted on August 6th after experiencing a syncopal episode attributed to dehydration and poor oral intake. The patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on August 12th and received dexamethasone for three days in preparation for chemotherapy initiation. He also received morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for pain from jaw and compression fractures.

The patient developed increasing oxygen requirements and bilateral pleural effusions, for which he was diuresed with lasix without improvement. On August 15th, he experienced hypoxia and hypotension, with low oxygen saturation in the 90s and systolic blood pressure in the 80s. As a result, he was triggered for hypoxia and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

During transport to the ICU, an emergency computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, which revealed right lower lobe (RLL) collapse/atelectasis with airway mucus and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient was nasotracheally intubated upon arrival in the ICU due to increased work of breathing and hypoxemia. He also experienced peri-intubation hypotension, for which intravenous fluids (IVFs) and norepinephrine (Levophed) were initiated.

The patient's current assessment and plan include sepsis/hypotension, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, RLL collapse/atelectasis, hypotension, leukocytosis, pleural effusions, SqCC of oropharynx and tongue, and depression (celexa). The patient is critically ill and requires aggressive support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and inability to clear secretions effectively, there is a risk of developing VAP.

2. Barotrauma: The patient's high airway pressures and the presence of atelectasis may increase the risk of barotrauma, which can lead to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.

3. Oxygen toxicity: The patient's high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) may increase the risk of oxygen toxicity, particularly if the duration of oxygen therapy is prolonged.

4. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hypotension indicate possible sepsis, which can be caused by hospital-acquired infections or the spread of cancer.

5. Refeeding syndrome: When the patient's nutrition is reintroduced, there is a risk of developing refeeding syndrome, characterized by electrolyte imbalances and fluid shifts.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo M w/ recently diagnosied SqCCa of oropharynx and tongue
   transferred to ICU for management of acute hypoxemic resp failure and
   hypotension/sepsis in setting of HAP.
   Primary issues include:
          Sepsis/hypotension
          Acute hypoxic resp failure
          HAP
          Leukocytosis
          Pleural effusions
          SqCCa of oropharynx and tongue
          AGMA--(resolved) [**1-19**] starvation ketosis
          Depression (celexa)
   Acute hypoxic resp failure in setting of RLL atelectasis/mucus plugging
   and HAP. Also with increasing pleural effusion on R which may further
   limit full re-expansion of R lung. Poor secretion clearance in setting
   of limited oral opening and sedation from ongoing pain medication
   requirement will be a long standing issue and there have been ongoing
   discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement.  Additionally,
   pt is at risk for chronic aspiration.  At present, barriers to
   extubation include large A-a gradient and secretions/sx needs.
   Agree with plan to con
t empiric antibx coverage for HAP (vanco,
   cefepime and cipro).  F/u cxs and adjust antibx regimen accordingly.
   Adjust vent settings following abgs
 can decrease FIO2 and lower
   driving pressure/PS to optimize pH. Continue MDIs, aggressive sx/pulm
   toilet. Pt may ultimately benefit from R dx/therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] to aid
   with lung reexpansion, noting that his R effusion has increased in the
   setting of fluid/blood resus.  Probable need for trach down the line to
   be addressed after acute issues have resolved with input from oncology
   team regarding prognosis as pt has been resistant to this in past.  His
   hypotension appears multifactorial (meds from intubation, prior
   diuresis, and sepsis all factors)-- improving after fluids and prbc
   transfusion. Urine outpt remains adequate.  Lactate (did rise) is now
   normalized and svo2 now > 70 after blood.  Will wean levo to off
   maintaining MAPs >60. He continues to have a pronounced leukocytosis
   but remains AF, noting he has been on recent steroids.  C diff sent and
   infection work-up underway.  TFs via PEG with nutrition following,
   monitoring lytes and phos, repleting as needed, as he is at risk for
   refeeding syndrome.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension/sepsis in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/64 mmHg to 78/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 640 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%.

The patient has a history of recently diagnosed SqCC of the oropharynx and tongue, for which he underwent therapeutic bronchoscopy for mucus plugging. He received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a low SVO2 of 35% that improved to 81% after the transfusion. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,192 mL and output of 1,147 mL since midnight, with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely etiologies include infections
   and pleural effusion. Imaging not consistent with pulmonary embolism.
   Elevated WBC is consistent with infection. Patient now intubated
   nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen to 40% FiO2 to assess oxygenation.
   - Increase PEEP to see if can help open up some of the alveoli and
   improve oxygenation
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - consider repeat bronchoscopy
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   # Septic Shock:  BP improved. Levophed weaned off.  Patient was
   afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, and he
   developed hypotension on the floor to 80s systolic, which was
   exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating medications.
   Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid boluses so he was
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   Off levophed currently.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will get CVL access today for starting chemotherapy
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  Initial plan was
   to start chemotherapy today.  He is s/p three days of high dose
   dexamethasone in anticipation.  Now course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure.
   - oncology to continue to follow in [**Last Name (LF) 1**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to reassess plans
   for chemotherapy
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely etiologies include infections
   and pleural effusion. Imaging not consistent with pulmonary embolism.
   Elevated WBC is consistent with infection. Patient now intubated
   nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen to 40% FiO2 to assess oxygenation.
   - Increase PEEP to see if can help open up some of the alveoli and
   improve oxygenation
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - consider repeat bronchoscopy
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   # Septic Shock:  BP improved. Levophed weaned off.  Patient was
   afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, and he
   developed hypotension on the floor to 80s systolic, which was
   exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating medications.
   Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid boluses so he was
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   Off levophed currently.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will get CVL access today for starting chemotherapy
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic
   coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] volume overload. Also could be SIADH in
   the setting of acute illness.
   - check Uosm and urine Na.
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Most likely etiology is mucous
   plugging, pleural effusion and right lower lobe collapse as seen on
   CTA.  Imaging not consistent with pulmonary embolism.  No significant
   pulmonary edema appreciated on chest CT concerning for cardiac etiology
   and EKG is not concerning for ischemia.  Elevated WBC count in this
   setting concerning for overlying infection. Patient now intubated
   nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen as tolerated for target oxygen saturations > 92%
   -> repeat ABG, decr driving pressure, decr pressure support
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis
   # Septic Shock:  Patient afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension,
   and leukocytosis.  Patient developed hypotension on the floor to 80s
   systolic, now exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating
   medications.  Hypotension is refractory to fluid boluses and currently

   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - currently on levophed (0.02) -> will wean as tolerated
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units prbcs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will hold on central line for now given PICC line available for

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension.

2. The likely etiology of the hypoxic respiratory failure is mucous plugging, pleural effusion, and right lower lobe collapse, as seen on CTA. There is no significant pulmonary edema appreciated on chest CT concerning for cardiac etiology, and EKG is not concerning for ischemia.

3. The patient has an elevated WBC count, which is concerning for overlying infection. He is now intubated nasotracheally.

4. The patient's current plan includes:
   - Follow-up BAL cultures
   - Vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for healthcare-associated pneumonia
   - Titrate down oxygen as tolerated for target oxygen saturations > 92%
   - Repeat ABG, decrease driving pressure, decrease pressure support
   - Switch to assist control if worsening respiratory status
   - No need for emergent tracheostomy as the airway is currently stable
   - Consider therapeutic thoracentesis

5. The patient also has septic shock, which is characterized by tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis. The hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Most likely etiology is mucous
   plugging, pleural effusion and right lower lobe collapse as seen on
   CTA.  Imaging not consistent with pulmonary embolism.  No significant
   pulmonary edema appreciated on chest CT concerning for cardiac etiology
   and EKG is not concerning for ischemia.  Elevated WBC count in this
   setting concerning for overlying infection. Patient now intubated
   nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care associated
   pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen as tolerated for target oxygen saturations > 92%
   -> repeat ABG, decr driving pressure, decr pressure support
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis
   # Septic Shock:  Patient afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension,
   and leukocytosis.  Patient developed hypotension on the floor to 80s
   systolic, now exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating
   medications.  Hypotension is refractory to fluid boluses and currently
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - currently on levophed (0.02) -> will wean as tolerated
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units prbcs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will hold on central line for now given PICC line available for
   pressors and adequate peripheral access
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will trend lactate
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  Initial plan was
   to start chemotherapy today.  He is s/p three days of high dose
   dexamethasone in anticipation.  Now course complicated by acute
   respiratory failure.
   - oncology to continue to follow in [**Last Name (LF) 1**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to reassess plans
   for chemotherapy
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo M w/ recently diagnosed SqCCa of oropharynx and tongue
   transferred to ICU for management of acute hypoxemic resp failure and
   hypotension/sepsis in setting of HAP.
   Primary issues include:
          Sepsis/hypotension
          Acute hypoxic resp failure
          HAP
          Leukocytosis
          Pleural effusions
          SqCCa of oropharynx and tongue
          AGMA--(resolved) [**1-19**] starvation ketosis --> now NGMA
          Depression (celexa)
              Hyponatremia (new, mild)
   Acute hypoxic resp failure in setting of RLL atelectasis/mucus plugging
   and HAP. Also with increasing pleural effusions which may further limit
   full re-expansion of R lung. Poor secretion clearance in setting of
   limited oral opening and sedation from ongoing pain medication
   requirement will be a long standing issue and there have been ongoing
   discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement.  Additionally,
   pt is at risk for aspiration and emesis in setting of chemo.  At
   present, barriers to extubation include his large A-a gradient and
   significant secretions/sx needs.
   Agree with plan to con
t empiric antibx coverage for HAP (vanco,
   cefepime and cipro).  Growing GNR and GPC in BAL cx, ID pending.  Will
   follow cxs and adjust antibx regimen accordingly.  Will decrease FIO2
   and trial increasing peep following abg. Consider clean out bronch
   given sig secretions.  B/l effusions have increased in setting of fluid
   resus.  Unclear if that is impacting lung reexpansion.  Will follow and
   consider IR guided tap.  Continue MDIs, aggressive sx/pulm toilet. Need
   for trach down the line to be addressed after acute issues have
   resolved with input from oncology team regarding prognosis as pt has
   been resistant to this in past.  [**Month (only) 51**] be avoidable pending response to
   chemo.
   His hypotension has resolved after aggressive IVFs.  Will place CVL to
   monitor CVP and for improved access . SVO2 has remained > 70 and
   lactate wnl. Urine outpt remains adequate.
   He continues to have a pronounced leukocytosis but remains AF, noting
   he has been on recent steroids.  C diff sent and infection work-up
   pending.  Plan for initiation of chemo today.  Will monitor for
   capillary leak syndrome/edema.
    Hyponatremic--likely hypovolemic ij setting of fluids, though at risk
   for siadh given his pulm process.  Will send urine na and osms.
    Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a recently diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma (SqCCa) of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension/sepsis in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 110/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2) is greater than 70%.

The patient has a history of leukocytosis, pleural effusions, and SqCCa of the oropharynx and tongue. He also has hyponatremia, depression, and an ongoing discussion regarding possible tracheostomy placement due to poor secretion clearance and limited oral opening. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). His blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values indicate potential imbalances in electrolytes"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of malignancy admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history is significant for malignancy, for which he is receiving chemotherapy. He has been experiencing hyponatremia, with a current sodium level of 133 mEq/L. The patient also has a history of SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion).

On physical examination, the patient appears mildly sedated on propofol and is able to nod to questions appropriately. He has decreased breath sounds on the right lower lung field with rhonchi, but no wheezes or rales. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm with a rate of 84 bpm. His blood pressure is within normal limits. He has a Foley catheter in place, draining clear urine.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values, including creatinine, total CO2, and glucose levels, are within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 114/50 mmH"

   Imaging:
   -CXR ([**2128-8-18**]): My read: possibly worsening bilateral pleural effusion,
   worse on the right side.  Endotracheal tube placement stable.  Left IJ
   placed.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely etiologies include infections
   and pleural effusion. Imaging not consistent with pulmonary embolism.
   Elevated WBC is consistent with infection. Patient now intubated
   nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen to 40% FiO2 to assess oxygenation.
   - Increase PEEP to see if can help open up some of the alveoli and
   improve oxygenation
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - consider repeat bronchoscopy
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
    .
   # Septic Shock:  BP improved. Levophed weaned off.  Patient was
   afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, and he
   developed hypotension on the floor to 80s systolic, which was
   exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating medications.
   Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid boluses so he was
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   Off levophed currently.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will get CVL access today for starting chemotherapy
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic
   coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] volume overload. Also could be SIADH in
   the setting of acute illness.
   - check Uosm and urine Na.
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has infections and pleural effusion contributing to his respiratory failure. He is intubated nasotracheally, and the team is monitoring his oxygenation levels. They plan to titrate down oxygen to 40% FiO2 and increase PEEP to improve oxygenation. If the patient's respiratory status worsens, they may switch to assist control mode.

2. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which has since improved. He was hypotensive and required vasopressor support, but his blood pressure improved after receiving fluids and antibiotics. The team is monitoring his blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output, and will continue to administer vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is consistent with an infection. This could be related to his pneumonia or other sources of infection. The team will continue to monitor his blood counts and follow up with cultures.

4. Malnutrition: The patient presented with dehydration and is now receiving nutritional support"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
   - followup BAL cultures
 showed e. coli and gram negative rods
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia until complete sensitivities return
   - increase PEEP from 5 to 7 and monitor improvement.
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - repeat bronchoscopy today to clear secretions
   - CVL placed to assess intravascular volume
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, responded to 2L fluid boluses. Levophed
   weaned off.  Patient was afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension,
   and leukocytosis.  Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid
   boluses so he was requiring levophed for blood pressure support.
   Currently with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic
   coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] volume overload, SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   -continue to monitor, stable
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
   - followup BAL cultures
 showed e. coli and gram negative rods
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia until complete sensitivities return
   - increase PEEP from 5 to 7 and monitor improvement.
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - repeat bronchoscopy today to clear secretions
   - CVL placed to assess intravascular volume
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, responded to 2L fluid boluses. Levophed
   weaned off.  Patient was afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension,
   and leukocytosis.  Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid
   boluses so he was requiring levophed for blood pressure support.
   Currently with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic
   coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] volume overload, SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   -continue to monitor, stable
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock, squamous cell carcinoma, leukocytosis, malnutrition, anemia, hyponatremia, anion gap acidosis, back pain, GERD, and depression. The patient is intubated nasotracheally, has bilateral pleural effusions, and is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, chemotherapy, pain control, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is continued atelectasis/mucous plugging, worsening pulmonary effusions, or poor secretion and clearance of oral secretions.
2. Septic Shock: There is a risk of further deterioration in the patient's hemodynamic status if there is ongoing infection and inadequate antibiotic coverage.
3. Chemotherapy-Related Complications: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy, which carries the risk of side effects such as myelosuppression, mucositis, and immunosuppression.
4. Malnutrition: The patient may continue to be at risk for nutritional deficiencies due to his underlying malignancy, ileostomy, and potential for reduced oral intake.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may further worsen due"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely etiologies include infections
   and pleural effusion. Imaging not consistent with pulmonary embolism.
   Elevated WBC is consistent with infection. Patient now intubated
   nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen to 40% FiO2 to assess oxygenation.
   - Increase PEEP to see if can help open up some of the alveoli and
   improve oxygenation
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - consider repeat bronchoscopy
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   # Septic Shock:  BP improved. Levophed weaned off.  Patient was
   afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, and he
   developed hypotension on the floor to 80s systolic, which was
   exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating medications.
   Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid boluses so he was
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   Off levophed currently.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will get CVL access today for starting chemotherapy
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic
   coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] volume overload. Also could be SIADH in
   the setting of acute illness.
   - check Uosm and urine Na.
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock, squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue, leukocytosis, malnutrition, anemia, hyponatremia, anion gap acidosis, back pain, GERD, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status can worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient may develop sepsis or experience worsening of septic shock due to ongoing infection, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Malignancy Progression: The patient's squamous cell carcinoma may progress, leading to worsening symptoms and potentially obstructive complications.
4. Leukocytosis: If the patient's white blood cell count continues to increase, it may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status can further deteriorate, leading to delayed wound healing, increased risk of infections, and compromised immune function.
6. Anemia: If the patient's anemia worsens, it may contribute to fatigue, decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and increased risk of infection.

   Imaging:
   -CXR ([**2128-8-18**]): My read: possibly worsening bilateral pleural effusion,
   worse on the right side.  Endotracheal tube placement stable.  Left IJ
   placed.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging and HAP.  Also worsening pleural effusion.
   Imaging not consistent with pulmonary embolism.  Elevated WBC is
   consistent with infection. Patient now intubated nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen to 40% FiO2 to assess oxygenation.
   - Increase PEEP to see if can help open up some of the alveoli and
   improve oxygenation
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - consider repeat bronchoscopy
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
    .
   # Septic Shock:  BP improved. Levophed weaned off.  Patient was
   afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, and he
   developed hypotension on the floor to 80s systolic, which was
   exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating medications.
   Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid boluses so he was
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   Off levophed currently.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will get CVL access today for starting chemotherapy
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic
   coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] volume overload. Also could be SIADH in
   the setting of acute illness.
   - check Uosm and urine Na.
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. 

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and he is currently intubated nasotracheally. The plan includes titrating down oxygen to assess oxygenation, increasing PEEP to open up alveoli, and switching to assist control if necessary.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's blood pressure improved after being treated with antibiotics and fluids. Levophed was weaned off, but the patient remains at risk for sepsis-related complications.
3. Malnutrition: The patient presented with dehydration and has a PEG tube in place for nutritional support. Monitoring for refeeding syndrome is important.
4. Anemia: The patient has a baseline hematocrit in the high 20s, which may be due to malignancy, ileostomy, or nutritional deficiencies.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, possibly due to volume overload or SIADH.
6. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient had acidosis secondary to starvation ketosis, but it has resolved with IVF.
7. Back Pain: The patient had acute compression fractures and was receiving morphine PCA on the floor.

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
   - followup BAL cultures
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.  Adjust
   antibiotics as culture data returns.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia until complete sensitivities return
   - increase PEEP from 5 to 7 and monitor improvement.
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - repeat bronchoscopy today to clear secretions
   - CVL placed to assess intravascular volume
   - bilateral effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation in the setting
   of low albumin

   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, responded to 2L fluid boluses. Levophed
   weaned off.  Patient was afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension,
   and leukocytosis.  Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid
   boluses so he was requiring levophed for blood pressure support.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock, leukocytosis, malnutrition, anemia, hyponatremia, anion gap acidosis, back pain, GERD, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to inadequate oxygenation of the blood. This condition can progress to respiratory arrest and death if not properly managed.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is at risk of further deterioration due to systemic infection, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and potentially death.
3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an ongoing infection. If left untreated, it can progress to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, increasing the risk of delayed wound healing, infections, and weakened immune system.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia can further compromise oxygen delivery to tissues, potentially exacerbating respiratory distress and increasing the risk of organ damage.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need close monitoring, as it can lead to seizures, coma, or even death if"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely etiologies include infections
   and pleural effusion. Imaging not consistent with pulmonary embolism.
   Elevated WBC is consistent with infection. Patient now intubated
   nasotracheally.
   - followup BAL cultures
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia
   - titrate down oxygen to 40% FiO2 to assess oxygenation.
   - Increase PEEP to see if can help open up some of the alveoli and
   improve oxygenation
   - currently doing well on pressure support, but if worsening
   respiratory status will switch to assist control
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - consider repeat bronchoscopy
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   # Septic Shock:  BP improved. Levophed weaned off.  Patient was
   afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, and he
   developed hypotension on the floor to 80s systolic, which was
   exacerbated post-intubation after receiving vasodilating medications.
   Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid boluses so he was
   requiring levophed for blood pressure support.  Most likely related to
   sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  Currently with PICC line for access.
   Off levophed currently.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - will get CVL access today for starting chemotherapy
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic
   coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] volume overload. Also could be SIADH in
   the setting of acute illness.
   - check Uosm and urine Na.
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The main concern here is the underlying cause of the hypoxia, which may be infection or a pleural effusion. Further investigation and management are necessary to improve oxygenation and wean off ventilatory support.

2. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient has leukocytosis, tachycardia, hypotension, and required vasopressor support. These findings suggest sepsis and possible septic shock. The current treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP). Close attention to the patient's hemodynamic status is crucial.

3. Malignancy-related complications: The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. Chemotherapy is planned, which carries its own risks and side effects. Monitoring for treatment-related toxicities and managing any associated complications such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia will be essential.

4. Malnutrition: The patient presented with dehydration and has had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed for nutritional support. Monitoring for refeeding syndrome is important, especially in patients with malnutrition. Close monitoring of electrolytes, particularly phosphate levels, is warranted.

5. Hyponat"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated nasotracheally, and there are concerns about infections and pleural effusion as potential causes. Imaging does not suggest pulmonary embolism. The patient will be monitored for oxygenation, and adjustments will be made to FiO2 and PEEP as necessary.

2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, which are indicative of sepsis. He developed hypotension post-intubation after receiving vasodilating medications. The patient's blood pressure improved, and Levophed was weaned off. Antibiotic coverage will be continued, and fluid boluses will be given to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and urine output above 30 cc/hr.

3. Malnutrition: The patient presented with dehydration and was placed on percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutritional support. Tube feeds will continue, and albumin levels will be monitored to check for refeeding syndrome.

4. Anemia: The patient has a baseline hematocrit in the high"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo M w/ recently diagnosed SqCCa of oropharynx and tongue
   transferred to ICU for management of acute hypoxemic resp failure and
   hypotension/sepsis in setting of HAP.
   Primary issues include:
          Sepsis/hypotension
          Acute hypoxic resp failure
          HAP (e coli, additional gnr, gpc)
          Leukocytosis
          Pleural effusions
          SqCCa of oropharynx and tongue
          Depression (celexa)
              Hyponatremia (new, mild, stable)
   Acute hypoxic resp failure in setting of RLL atelectasis/mucus plugging
   and HAP. Also with increasing pleural effusions which may further limit
   full re-expansion of R lung. Poor secretion clearance in setting of
   limited oral opening and sedation from ongoing pain medication
   requirement will be a long standing issue and there have been ongoing
   discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement.  Additionally,
   pt is at risk for aspiration and emesis in setting of chemo.  At
   present, barriers to extubation include his large A-a gradient,
   significant secretions/sx needs, plugging.
   Agree with plan to con
t current antibx coverage for HAP (vanco,
   cefepime and cipro) ecoli is pan [**Doctor Last Name **] and await d on addiioanl bacteria.
   Will follow cxs and adjust antibx regimen accordingly.  Will trial
   increasing peep following abg to better recruit. Clean out bronch given
   sig secretions ? plugging.  B/l effusions have increased in setting of
   fluid resus.  Unclear if that is impacting lung reexpansion.  Will
   follow and consider IR guided tap.  Continue MDIs, aggressive sx/pulm
   toilet. Need for trach down the line to be addressed after acute issues
   have resolved with input from oncology team regarding prognosis as pt
   has been resistant to this in past.  [**Month (only) 51**] be avoidable pending response
   to chemo.
   Recurrent hypotension has resolved after additional IVFs.  CVps low but
   now normotensive and urine outpt adequate.  Continue to follow
   closely.  His low albumin and third spacing .
   He continues to have a pronounced leukocytosis but remains AF, noting
   he remains on steroids.  C diff neg and infection work-up pending.
   Continue chemo.  Will monitor for capillary leak syndrome/edema.
    Hyponatremic--likely combo hypovolemic ij setting of fluids, though at

- He was transferred to the ICU for management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension/sepsis in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- The primary issues include sepsis/hypotension, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, HAP, leukocytosis, pleural effusions, squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue, depression, and hyponatremia.
- The patient has been receiving chemotherapy and is at risk for aspiration and emesis due to limited oral opening and ongoing pain medication requirement.
- There have been ongoing discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement due to poor secretion clearance.
- The patient has recurrent hypotension, which has resolved after additional intravenous fluids.
- He continues to have pronounced leukocytosis but remains afebrile, noting that he remains on steroids.
- His low albumin and third spacing are being monitored.
- The patient's infection work-up is pending, and he will be monitored for capillary leak syndrome/edema.
- His hyponatremia is likely due to combination hypovolemic and SIADH in the setting of fluids, and urine sodium and osmolality will be sent.

   full re-expansion of R lung. Poor secretion clearance in setting of
   limited oral opening and sedation from ongoing pain medication
   requirement will be a long standing issue and there have been ongoing
   discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement.  Additionally,
   pt is at risk for aspiration and emesis in setting of chemo.  At

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with recently diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma (SqCCa) of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension/sepsis in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's medical history includes depression for which he is taking citalopram (celexa), and he also has a history of SqCCa. The patient has been receiving chemotherapy, which may contribute to poor secretion clearance due to ongoing pain medication requirements. There have been ongoing discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement, considering the patient's large A-a gradient and significant secretions/sx needs.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 942 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 12, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and an oxygen saturation level (SpO2) of 93%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 19.6 to 22.8 thousand cells/mm3, hyponatremia with a sodium level (Na+) ranging from 122 to 154 mg/dL, and low albumin level of 2.1 g/dL. Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions, and microbiology results indicate the presence of E. coli and another gram-negative organism in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

The patient's current medical complications include sepsis/hypotension, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, HAP, leukocytosis, pleural effusions, SqCCa of oropharynx and tongue, depression, and hyponatremia. The primary issues include limited oral opening, poor secretion clearance, risk of aspiration and emesis during chemotherapy, and the need for potential tracheostomy placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise in the future may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying conditions and current critical state."

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with recently diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension/sepsis in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient has several medical complications and potential issues, including:
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure along with signs of infection, indicating sepsis.
2. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is having difficulty breathing and not enough oxygen is reaching his tissues.
3. HAP: The patient has developed pneumonia while in the hospital, which is caused by E. coli and possibly other Gram-negative bacteria.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection.
5. Pleural effusions: The patient has fluid buildup around the lungs, which may further limit full re-expansion of the right lung.
6. Squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue: The patient's underlying cancer may complicate his recovery.
7. Depression: The patient is taking citalopram (Celexa) for depression.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels in his blood.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
   - followup BAL cultures
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.  Adjust
   antibiotics as culture data returns.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia until complete sensitivities return
   - increase PEEP from 5 to 7 and monitor improvement.
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - repeat bronchoscopy today to clear secretions
   - CVL placed to assess intravascular volume
   - bilateral effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation in the setting
   of low albumin
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, responded to 2L fluid boluses. Levophed
   weaned off.  Patient was afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension,
   and leukocytosis.  Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid
   boluses so he was requiring levophed for blood pressure support.
   Currently with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - CVPs trended down overnight but now normotensive w/ urine outpt WNL.
   Lactate remain wnl.  His low albumin w/ third spacing with
   intravascular depletion which are likely contributing factor.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic
   coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   -continue to monitor, stable
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. 

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure due to right lower lobe atelectasis/mucous plugging, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), worsening pulmonary effusions limiting lung re-expansion, and poor secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to sedation. The patient is now intubated nasotracheally.

2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient likely had sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He showed signs of hypotension overnight but responded to 2L fluid boluses. Levophed was weaned off. The patient presented with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis. Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid boluses, so he required Levophed for blood pressure support.

3. Bilateral Pleural Effusions: The effusions are likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is likely infectious. It could also be contributed by steroids.

5. Malnutrition: The patient presented with dehydration and now has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
   - followup BAL cultures
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.  Adjust
   antibiotics as culture data returns.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia until complete sensitivities return
   - increase PEEP from 5 to 7 and monitor improvement.
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - repeat bronchoscopy today to clear secretions
   - CVL placed to assess intravascular volume
   - bilateral effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation in the setting
   of low albumin
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, responded to 2L fluid boluses. Levophed
   weaned off.  Patient was afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension,
   and leukocytosis.  Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid
   boluses so he was requiring levophed for blood pressure support.
   Currently with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - CVPs trended down overnight but now normotensive w/ urine outpt WNL.
   Lactate remain wnl.  His low albumin w/ third spacing with
   intravascular depletion which are likely contributing factor.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypoxic respiratory failure: Occurred in the setting of right lower lobe atelectasis/mucus plugging, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), worsening pulmonary effusions limiting lung re-expansion. Poor secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and sedation also contribute. The patient is now intubated nasotracheally. Bilateral pleural effusions are likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
- Sepsis and septic shock: Likely secondary to sepsis in the setting of pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure was hypotensive overnight, responding to 2L fluid boluses. Levophed was weaned off. The patient was afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis. Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid boluses so he required Levophed for blood pressure support. Currently, with a PICC line and CVL for access.
- Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in high 20s. Normocytic. Unclear etiology but in the setting of malignancy, ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.

- Back pain: Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute compression fractures.
- GERD: Continue lansoprazole.
- Depression: Continue bupropion and citalopram.

The patient's lab results show:
- WBC: 20.7 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 29.4%
- Platelets: 243
- Creatinine: 0.6
- TropT: <0.01
- TCO2: 26
- Glucose: 116
- Other lab values including electrolytes, albumin, and kidney function tests are within normal range.

The patient's vital signs include:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm
- Blood pressure: 110/50 mmHg (78/41-128/58)
- Respiratory rate: 7 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on FiO2 60%
- Central venous pressure: 5 mmHg

The patient is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin), sedatives (fentanyl and midazolam), and other ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and pressure from the ventilator can lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of nosocomial infections.
5. Refeeding syndrome: The patient is receiving enteral nutrition after being malnourished, which carries the risk of developing refeeding syndrome.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and the use of anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Delirium: Prolonged sedation and ICU stay can lead to delirium."

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure due to right lower lobe atelectasis/mucous plugging, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and worsening pulmonary effusions. The patient was intubated nasotracheally, and PEEP was increased to 10 cmH2O. Further management includes weaning off assist control mode and considering therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens.

2. Sepsis and Septic Shock: The patient likely developed sepsis secondary to pneumonia, leading to septic shock. The patient was hypotensive overnight and required brief pressors (levophed). A central venous line (CVL) was placed for access, and the patient received IV fluids and antibiotics. Monitoring includes trends in blood pressure, lactate levels, and repeat SVO2.

3. Malnutrition: The patient presented with dehydration and subsequently had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for nutritional support. Close monitoring of albumin and electrolytes is necessary to prevent refeeding syndrome.

4. Anemia: The patient has a baseline hematocrit in the high 20"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
   - followup BAL cultures
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.  Adjust
   antibiotics as culture data returns.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for health care
   associated pneumonia until complete sensitivities return
   - increase PEEP from 5 to 7 and monitor improvement.
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - repeat bronchoscopy today to clear secretions
   - CVL placed to assess intravascular volume
   - bilateral effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation in the setting
   of low albumin
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, responded to 2L fluid boluses. Levophed
   weaned off.  Patient was afebrile but with tachycardia, hypotension,
   and leukocytosis.  Hypotension was initially refractory to fluid
   boluses so he was requiring levophed for blood pressure support.
   Currently with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - CVPs trended down overnight but now normotensive w/ urine outpt WNL.
   Lactate remain wnl.  His low albumin w/ third spacing with
   intravascular depletion which are likely contributing factor.
   - vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. Got one dose of decadron yesterday, will need two more doses in
   the next two days
   - start chemo today
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for antibiotic
   coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   -continue to monitor, stable
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock, anemia, malnutrition, hyponatremia, anion gap acidosis, back pain, GERD, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may worsen if there is continued inability to clear secretions and re-expand the lung.
2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: There is a risk of further deterioration due to infection and inadequate response to fluid resuscitation.
3. Anemia: Nutritional deficiencies and ongoing blood loss may contribute to worsening anemia, leading to decreased oxygen carrying capacity.
4. Malnutrition: Inadequate nutritional support could lead to further weight loss, muscle wasting, and impaired healing.
5. Hyponatremia: If left untreated, it can lead to neurological complications such as seizures.
6. Anion Gap Acidosis: Reoccurrence of this condition may indicate inadequate glycemic control or other metabolic disturbances.
7. Back Pain: Compression fractures may worsen, resulting in spinal cord compression and paralysis.
8. GERD: Aspiration pneumonia may develop if acid reflux is not properly managed.
9. Depression: Poor mental health can impact overall well-being and recovery"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on 08/18/2128 at 04:15 PM and blood cultures were drawn from an arterial line and an aline. The patient's wife was informed about the possibility of tracheostomy in the future and she agreed. The patient became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 78/42 mmHg and was started on Levo. Chest X-ray showed possible increased opacity at the lung bases, but lung volumes were lower, which may reflect crowding. The patient was briefly placed on assist control due to respiratory distress, tachycardia, dropped oxygen saturation (SpO2), and worsening chest X-ray after bronchoscopy. PEEP was increased to 10 cmH2O, FiO2 was increased to 70%, and then returned to 60%, while the patient was sedated. The patient received Lasix 10mg IV, which improved his condition, and was placed back on pressure support (PS) 4-25 with FiO2 60%.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has been receiving various antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   B/l effusions have increased in setting of fluids, given low albumin.
   Unclear if that is impacting lung reexpansion.  Also with pulm edema
   after sig fluids.  Will attempt gentle durresis using albumin and
   lasix.  Consider IR guided tap of pleural effusions.  Continue current
   vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.  Continue to assess for
   possible extubation, though likely will need trach.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
   - dropped sats yesterday, briefly on assist control, but now back on PS
   and stable
   - followup BAL cultures for HAP
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.
   Will discontinue cefepime and vancomycin.  Continue ciprofloxacin.
   - continue PEEP at 10 but attempt to wean as tolerated.
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - bilateral effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation in the setting
   of low albumin
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, levophed weaned off.  Patient was afebrile
   but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis.   Currently with
   PICC line and CVL for access.
   - Hypotensive overnight requiring brief pressors (levophed).  Weaned
   successfully at CVPs trended down overnight but now normotensive w/
   urine outpt WNL.  Lactate remain wnl.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage given BAL
   sensitivities
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. One more day of decadron
   - continue chemo
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids. Appears to be resolving
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - check electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   -continue to monitor, stable
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs, including hypotension and tachycardia. The patient underwent an unsuccessful bronchoscopy attempt, which led to worsening of the respiratory status. 

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 110/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, suggesting an ongoing infection. Blood cultures have been drawn from both arterial and peripheral lines. The patient's renal function is normal based on the serum creatinine level. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows possible increased opacity at the lung bases, but lung volumes appear lower, which may reflect crowding. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma due to the high levels of PEEP and FiO2. The patient also requires careful monitoring for any"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and blood cultures were taken. There were concerns about the possibility of tracheostomy in the future, which the wife agreed upon.

The patient became hypotensive with a blood pressure reading of 78/42 mmHg, and Levo was started. Another chest X-ray showed possible increased opacity at the lung bases but no significant changes from prior. The patient was briefly on assist control mode due to respiratory distress, tachycardia, dropped saturation levels, and worsening CXR after bronchoscopy. The PEEP was increased to 10, FiO2 to 60%, and then back to 60%. Increased sedation was also given.

The patient received Lasix 10mg IV, thinking it was flash pulmonary edema, and improved afterwards. The patient is now back on PSV mode with FiO2 60%.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 08/18/2128 at 07:53 PM, Cefepime on 08/19/2128 at 03:57 AM, and Ciprofloxacin on 08/19/2128 at 03:57 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   B/l effusions have increased in setting of fluids, given low albumin.
   Unclear if that is impacting lung reexpansion.  Also with pulm edema
   after sig fluids.  Will attempt gentle durresis using albumin and
   lasix.  Consider IR guided tap of pleural effusions.  Continue current
   vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.  Continue to assess for
   possible extubation, though likely will need trach.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
   - dropped sats yesterday, briefly on assist control, but now back on PS
   and stable
   - followup BAL cultures for HAP
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.
   Will discontinue cefepime and vancomycin.  Continue ciprofloxacin.
   - continue PEEP at 10 but attempt to wean as tolerated.
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - bilateral effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation in the setting
   of low albumin
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, levophed weaned off.  Patient was afebrile
   but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis.   Currently with
   PICC line and CVL for access.
   - Hypotensive overnight requiring brief pressors (levophed).  Weaned
   successfully at CVPs trended down overnight but now normotensive w/
   urine outpt WNL.  Lactate remain wnl.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage given BAL
   sensitivities
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. One more day of decadron
   - continue chemo
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids. Appears to be resolving
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - check electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   -continue to monitor, stable
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue, who was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been intubated nasotracheally due to respiratory distress, tachypnea, and dropped oxygen saturation levels. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and a tidal volume of 500 mL.

The patient's blood cultures have shown the presence of E. coli, which is sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Therefore, the patient is being continued on ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage. The patient's condition is complicated by bilateral pleural effusions, likely due to fluid resuscitation, and there is a consideration for therapeutic thoracentesis if the effusion worsens.

The patient also has septic shock, likely secondary to pneumonia. He required pressors overnight but was successfully weaned off them. The patient's lactate levels are within normal range. He is being continued on ciprofloxacin, and IV fluids are being administered to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and urine output above 30 cc/hr.

The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue and is scheduled to start chemotherapy today. A central venous line (CVL) has been placed for"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension/sepsis in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's primary issues include sepsis/hypotension, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, HAP caused by E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, capillary leak, edema, leukocytosis, pleural effusions, and depression.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to limited oral opening, ongoing pain medication requirement, and sedation.
2. Tracheostomy placement: There have been ongoing discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement due to poor secretion clearance and limited oral opening.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has worsening pulmonary edema, which may further limit full re-expansion of the right lung.
4. Capillary leak syndrome/edema: The patient is at risk for capillary leak syndrome/edema, which can lead to fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has mild, stable hyponatremia that requires monitoring.
6. Infection: The patient has ongoing infection work-up pending, and there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff)"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo M w/ recently diagnosed SqCCa of oropharynx and tongue
   transferred to ICU for management of acute hypoxemic resp failure and
   hypotension/sepsis in setting of HAP.
   Primary issues include:
          Sepsis/hypotension (off pressors)
          Acute hypoxic resp failure
          HAP (e coli, pan [**Last Name (un) 270**])
              Capillary leak, edema
          Leukocytosis
          Pleural effusions
          SqCCa of oropharynx and tongue
          Depression (celexa)
              Hyponatremia (new, mild, stable)
   Acute hypoxic resp failure in setting of mucus plugging and HAP. Also
   with increasing pleural effusions, now with pulm edema. Poor secretion
   clearance in setting of limited oral opening and sedation from ongoing
   pain medication requirement will be a long standing issue and there
   have been ongoing discussions regarding possible tracheostomy
   placement.  Additionally, pt is at risk for aspiration and emesis in
   setting of chemo.  At present, barriers to extubation remain peep dep,
   pulm edema and poor airway in setting of inability to open mouth.
   Agree with plan to taper antibx given pan [**Doctor Last Name **] e coli in sputum as only
   pos cx (from BAL). B/l effusions have increased in setting of fluids,
   given low albumin.  Unclear if that is impacting lung reexpansion.
   Also with pulm edema after sig fluids.  Will attempt gentle durresis
   using albumin and lasix.  Consider IR guided tap of pleural effusions.
   Continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.  Continue
   to assess for possible extubation, though likely will need trach.
   His leukocytosis is improving and he remains af, noting he is on
   steroids.  Low threshold for recx
ing and broadening coverage in
   setting of clinical decline.
   Continue chemo per onc team.  Will monitor for capillary leak
   syndrome/edema.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a recently diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension/sepsis in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's medical history includes depression, for which he was taking citalopram (Celexa). He also has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue.

The patient's current condition includes sepsis/hypotension, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, HAP caused by E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, capillary leak with edema, leukocytosis, pleural effusions, and hyponatremia.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, using an endotracheal tube, and has a FiO2 of 50%. His ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 174, indicating severe hypoxemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, warm skin, muscle wasting, and right lower extremity edema. He is awake but not following commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased platelet count. Other lab values include elevated blood glucose levels, elevated troponin T levels, and elevated lactate acid"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Currently on PS and
   stable.
   - f/u BAL cultures for HAP
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.
   - continue ciprofloxacin (on day 6) until [**2128-8-22**] (day 8)  (discontinued
   vanc and cefepime)
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - attempt decrease in PEEP if stable at 40% FiO2 as tolerated
   - repeat ABG this AM.  Attempt SBT over weekend if low RSBI score.  Try
   to wean from vent, but given secretions and airway issues, may need
   trach for airway control.  Will plan to c/s IP for procedure next week
    .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Effusions are currently decreasing.  Unclear if
   that is impacting lung re-expansion.  Patient is diuresing well.  If cr
   stable, will continue gentle diurese using albumin and lasix.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - continue to assess for possible extubation
   - f/u with renal function with goal of -500cc balance yesterday.  If cr
   is stable, increase goal to 1-1.5L negative balance.
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently with PICC line
   and CVL for access.
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage given BAL
   sensitivities. Currently day [**5-24**].
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - continue 5-FU
   # Leukocytosis: Continuing to downtrend. Likely infectious vs. hx of
   steroids.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Back at baseline hematocrit, which is in the high 20s.
   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor, stable
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # B/L effusions: Bilateral pleural effusions likely due to fluid
   resuscitation vs. malignant effusion. They have initially increased in
   setting of fluids, given low albumin.  Effusions are currently
   decreasing.  Unclear if that is impacting lung re-expansion.  Also with
   pulm edema after sig fluids.  Will attempt gentle diurese using albumin
   and lasix.
   - consider IR guided tap of pleural effusions if effusions worsen.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - continue to assess for possible extubation
   - f/u with renal function with goal of -500cc balance yesterday.  If cr
   is stable, increase goal to 1-1.5L negative balance.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Currently on PS and
   stable.
   - f/u BAL cultures for HAP
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.  Will
   discontinue cefepime and vancomycin.
   - continue ciprofloxacin.
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - attempt decrease in PEEP if stable at 40% FiO2 as tolerated
   - aim for extubation over weekend
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - repeat ABG
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, levophed weaned off.  Patient was afebrile
   but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis.   Currently with
   PICC line and CVL for access.
   - Hypotensive overnight requiring brief pressors (levophed).  Weaned
   successfully at CVPs trended down overnight but now normotensive w/
   urine outpt WNL.  Lactate remain wnl.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage given BAL
   sensitivities. Currently day [**5-24**].
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. One more day of decadron
   - continue chemo
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids. Appears to be resolving
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - check electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor, stable
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # B/L effusions: Bilateral pleural effusions likely due to fluid
   resuscitation vs. malignant effusion. They have initially increased in
   setting of fluids, given low albumin.  Effusions are currently
   decreasing.  Unclear if that is impacting lung re-expansion.  Also with
   pulm edema after sig fluids.  Will attempt gentle diurese using albumin
   and lasix.
   - consider IR guided tap of pleural effusions if effusions worsen.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - continue to assess for possible extubation
   - f/u with renal function with goal of -500cc balance yesterday.  If cr
   is stable, increase goal to 1-1.5L negative balance.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Currently on PS and
   stable.
   - f/u BAL cultures for HAP
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.  Will
   discontinue cefepime and vancomycin.
   - continue ciprofloxacin.
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - attempt decrease in PEEP if stable at 40% FiO2 as tolerated
   - aim for extubation over weekend
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - repeat ABG
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, levophed weaned off.  Patient was afebrile
   but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis.   Currently with
   PICC line and CVL for access.
   - Hypotensive overnight requiring brief pressors (levophed).  Weaned
   successfully at CVPs trended down overnight but now normotensive w/
   urine outpt WNL.  Lactate remain wnl.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage given BAL
   sensitivities. Currently day [**5-24**].
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. One more day of decadron
   - continue chemo
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids. Appears to be resolving
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - check electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor, stable
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Bilateral pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which are likely due to fluid resuscitation versus malignant effusion. The effusions initially increased with fluid administration but are currently decreasing. It is unclear if this is impacting lung re-expansion. The plan is to attempt gentle diuresis using albumin and lasix. If the effusions worsen, consider an image-guided thoracentesis.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient experienced hypoxic respiratory failure due to right lower lobe atelectasis/mucus plugging, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), worsening pulmonary effusions limiting lung re-expansion, and poor secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and sedation. The patient is now intubated nasotracheally and on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The plan is to follow up with a bronchoscopy for HAP and discontinue cefepime and vancomycin. Continue ciprofloxacin, decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated, attempt decrease in PEEP if stable at 40% FiO2 as tolerated, aim for extubation over"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   Acute hypoxic resp failure in setting of mucus plugging and HAP,
   pulmonary edema and effusions. Poor secretion clearance in setting of
   limited oral opening and sedation from ongoing pain medication
   requirement will be a long standing issue and there have been ongoing
   discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement.  Additionally,
   pt is at risk for aspiration and emesis in setting of chemo.  At
   present, barriers to extubation remain peep dep, pulm edema and poor
   airway in setting of inability to open mouth.
   Agree with plan to complete 8 day course of cipro for e coli HAP (day
   6).  B/l effusions and pulm edema improving by imaging and able to wean
   fio2 to 50%.  Will follow lytes and renal fx and continue diuresis (alb
   and lasix) with goal 500-1L neg.  Continue PS, mdis and pulm toilet.
   Will check abg and wean fio2 to 40% and see if able to decrease peep.
   Over wkd may be able to assess for SBT if on elss peep.  While we
   continue to work toward eweaning from vent, given his secretions and
   airway issues, feel he will need trach for airway control and secretion
   management and will c/s IP for procedure early next week.
   His leukocytosis con
t to improve and he remains af, noting he is on
   steroids.  Low threshold for recx
ing and broadening coverage in
   setting of clinical decline.
   Continue chemo per onc team.  Will monitor for capillary leak
   syndrome/edema.   Hyponatremia appears multifactorial related to volume
   status and siadh.  Continue to follow na for trend.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Currently on PS and
   stable.
   - f/u BAL cultures for HAP
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.  Will
   discontinue cefepime and vancomycin.
   - continue ciprofloxacin (on day 6) until [**2128-8-22**] (day 8)
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - attempt decrease in PEEP if stable at 40% FiO2 as tolerated
   - aim for extubation over weekend
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - repeat ABG
    .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluids, given low
   albumin.  Effusions are currently decreasing.  Unclear if that is
   impacting lung re-expansion.  Also with pulm edema after sig fluids.
   Will attempt gentle diurese using albumin and lasix.
   - consider IR guided tap of pleural effusions if effusions worsen.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - continue to assess for possible extubation
   - f/u with renal function with goal of -500cc balance yesterday.  If cr
   is stable, increase goal to 1-1.5L negative balance.
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently with PICC line
   and CVL for access.
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage given BAL
   sensitivities. Currently day [**5-24**].
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - continue 5-FU
   # Leukocytosis: Continuing to downtrend. Likely infectious vs. hx of
   steroids.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Back at baseline hematocrit, which is in the high 20s.
   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor, stable
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Tcurrent: 35.6°C (96.1°F), HR: 91 bpm, BP: 109/52 mmHg (71), RR: 13 breaths/min, SpO2: 95%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP: 3 mmHg, total in/out balance: -836 mL (with 836 mL of fluid given since midnight).
- Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 set at 50%, PEEP: 10 cmH2O, and PS: 5 cmH2O.
- Labs: WBC: 20.7 K/uL, Hct: 29.4%, Plt: 243 K/uL, Cr: 0.6 mg/dL, TropT: <0.01 ng/mL, Glucose: 116 mg/dL, pH: 7.46, PCO2: 44 mmHg, PO2: 105 mmHg, Ca++: 7.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 2.9 mg/dL.
- CXR: Decreased haziness/opacities of lung fields bilaterally.
- Microbiology: E. coli identified from BAL, sensitive to ciprofloxacin.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to mucus plugging and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), pulmonary edema, and effusions. There are ongoing discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement. The patient is at risk for aspiration and emesis in the setting of chemotherapy. Current barriers to extubation include high PEEP, pulmonary edema, and poor airway due to limited oral opening and sedation from ongoing pain medication requirement.
2. Bilateral effusions and pulmonary edema: These are improving by imaging and the patient is able to wean FiO2 to 50%. The plan is to continue diuresis (albumin and lasix) with a goal of 500-1L negative balance. PS, mdis, and pulmonary toilet will be continued. ABG will be checked and FiO2 will be weaned to 40% to see if PEEP can be decreased. If the patient remains stable on low PEEP, spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be assessed.
3. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient likely had septic shock secondary to sepsis in the setting of pneumonia. He is currently stable without the"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   B/l effusions have increased in setting of fluids, given low albumin.
   Unclear if that is impacting lung reexpansion.  Also with pulm edema
   after sig fluids.  Will attempt gentle durresis using albumin and
   lasix.  Consider IR guided tap of pleural effusions.  Continue current
   vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.  Continue to assess for
   possible extubation, though likely will need trach.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Bilateral pleural
   effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation vs. malignant effusion.
   - dropped sats yesterday, briefly on assist control, but now back on PS
   and stable
   - followup BAL cultures for HAP
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.
   Will discontinue cefepime and vancomycin.  Continue ciprofloxacin.
   - continue PEEP at 10 but attempt to wean as tolerated.
   - no need for emergent tracheostomy as airway currently stable, will
   rediscuss if necessary for planned treatment of head and neck cancer
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if pleural effusion worsens
   - bilateral effusions likely due to fluid resuscitation in the setting
   of low albumin
    .
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP hypotensive overnight, levophed weaned off.  Patient was afebrile
   but with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis.   Currently with
   PICC line and CVL for access.
   - Hypotensive overnight requiring brief pressors (levophed).  Weaned
   successfully at CVPs trended down overnight but now normotensive w/
   urine outpt WNL.  Lactate remain wnl.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage given BAL
   sensitivities
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - repeat SVO2.   ScVO2  was low [**2128-8-15**] at 35, was transfused 2 units
   pRBCs, then 80
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   - will get CVP after CVL placed today to better assess intravascular
   volume
   - will trend lactate
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  start chemotherapy
   today. One more day of decadron
   - continue chemo
   - f/u oncology recs
   - place CVL for chemotherapy
   # Leukocytosis: Likely infectious. Also could be contributed by
   steroids. Appears to be resolving
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - check electrolytes to closely monitor for development of refeeding
   syndrome, check phosphorus
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Baseline hematocrit in high 20s.  Normocytic.  Unclear
   etiology but in setting of malignancy, and  ileostomy, with possible
   nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   -continue to monitor, stable
   # Anion Gap Acidosis:  Noted on floor, now resolved with IVF, likely
   secondary to starvation ketosis.
   - continue tube feeds
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. 

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. These include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure due to right lower lobe atelectasis/mucus plugging, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and worsening pulmonary effusions limiting lung re-expansion. The patient is currently intubated nasotracheally, and bilateral pleural effusions are likely due to fluid resuscitation.

2. Sepsis and Septic Shock: The patient likely had sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He required brief pressors (levophed) overnight, which were successfully weaned off. The patient's blood pressure was hypotensive, but now he is normotensive with normal urine output. Lactate levels remained within normal limits.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a baseline hematocrit in the high 20s, which is normocytic. The etiology is unclear, but it may be due to malignancy, ileostomy, and possible nutritional deficiencies. 

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, possibly due to hypovolemia versus syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH"

              Depression (on celexa)
   Acute hypoxic resp failure in setting of mucus plugging, HAP,pulmonary
   edema and pleural effusions. Poor secretion clearance in setting of
   limited oral opening and sedation from ongoing pain medication
   requirement will be a long standing issue and there have been ongoing
   discussions regarding possible tracheostomy placement.  At present,
   barriers to extubation remain peep dep, secretions, pulm edema and poor
   airway in setting of inability to open mouth.
   Agree with plan to complete 8 day course of cipro for e coli  pna (day
   6). B/l effusions and pulm edema improving and able to wean fio2 to
   50%.  Following lytes and renal fx, would continue diuresis (alb and
   lasix) with goal 500-1L neg.  Check abg and wean fio2 to 40%, then
   attempt to decrease peep. Over wkd if on less peep would assess for
   SBT.  While we continue to work toward weaning from vent, given his
   secretions and airway issues, feel he will need trach for airway
   control and secretion management. will c/s IP for procedure early next
   week.  Continue mdis and pulm toilet.
   His leukocytosis con
t  to improve and he remains af, noting he is on

   Continue chemo per onc team.
   Hyponatremia appears multifactorial related to volume status and

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and sepsis secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, and his current condition is stable with improving pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. However, there are ongoing barriers to extubation, including poor secretion clearance, limited oral opening, and ongoing pain medication requirements. The healthcare team plans to complete an 8-day course of ciprofloxacin for the E. coli pneumonia. Diuresis with albumin and lasix will continue with a goal of negative fluid balance. The patient's leukocytosis is improving, but he remains at risk for recurrent infection. Tracheostomy placement is being considered for airway control and secretion management. The patient's hyponatremia appears multifactorial and will be monitored. The remainder of the plan is outlined in the resident's note."

   IMAGING: CXR from today (my read): slightly more volume overloaded than
   yesterday.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
   oropharynx and tongue is here in ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Most likely occurred secondary to
   aspiration pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli.
   Occurred in setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening
   pulmonary effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Patient
   now intubated nasotracheally, on PS and stable.  Barriers to extubation
   include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation, and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue, necessitating
   a trach. Even if he can be safely extubated, he likely will need trach
   anyway given his risk of aspiration in the setting of high tumor burden
   and nausea associated with his future chemo therapy. With his WBC
   trending down, It wold be safer to trach pt when his WBC is still
   within normal range. Also, would not be ideal to leave a nasotracheal
   tube in when pt is leukopenic.
   - consult IP and radiology for possible trach this weekend
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - continue to attempt decrease his ventilator dependence
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diurese using albumin and
   lasix.  Now slightly more effusions on CXR.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - Attemp goal of 1L negative balance today
   .
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - finish last day of 5-FU
   - touch base with oncology regarding the interaction between chemo
   drugs and all the vitamins he is currently receiving
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Resolved. Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of
   pneumonia.  BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently
   with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - f/u with oncology recs considering length of CVL placement
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Now trending down, heading toward leukopenia. Likely
   secondary to chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Back at baseline hematocrit, which is in the high 20s.
   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role. He is not in DIC, not hemolyzing, and
   presents with low reticulocyte count.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - continue iron supplements, folate for now, touch base with oncology
   whether they interfere with chemotherapy.
   # Hyponatremia: Currently stable. Possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in
   the setting of squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process). Urine
   Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor
   # Back Pain:
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He is in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient is intubated nasotracheally, on pressure support ventilation (PSV), and stable. He has a history of aspiration pneumonia with sputum positive for pan-sensitive E. coli. The patient also has bilateral pulmonary effusions, which initially increased due to fluid resuscitation but have improved with diuretics. He is expected to undergo a tracheostomy due to his high tumor burden and risk of aspiration. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, likely secondary to chemotherapy. He also has anemia, malnutrition, hyponatremia, back pain, GERD, and depression. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, lansoprazole, bupropion, and citalopram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, as he is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening lung effusions.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and current high tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue increase the risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection and"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
   the oropharynx and tongue is transferred to the ICU for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Occurred in setting of RLL
   atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary effusions
   limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Also contributing are poor
   secretion and clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation.  Patient now intubated nasotracheally.  Currently on PS and
   stable.
   - f/u BAL cultures for HAP
 e. coli from BAL is pan sensitive.
   - continue ciprofloxacin (on day 6) until [**2128-8-22**] (day 8)  (discontinued
   vanc and cefepime)
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - attempt decrease in PEEP if stable at 40% FiO2 as tolerated
   - repeat ABG this AM.  Attempt SBT over weekend if low RSBI score.  Try
   to wean from vent, but given secretions and airway issues, may need
   trach for airway control.  Will plan to c/s IP for procedure next week
    .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Effusions are currently decreasing.  Unclear if
   that is impacting lung re-expansion.  Patient is diuresing well.  If cr
   stable, will continue gentle diurese using albumin and lasix.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - continue to assess for possible extubation
   - f/u with renal function with goal of -500cc balance yesterday.  If cr
   is stable, increase goal to 1-1.5L negative balance.
   # Septic Shock:  Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of pneumonia.
   BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently with PICC line
   and CVL for access.
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage given BAL
   sensitivities. Currently day [**5-24**].
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - arterial line placed for closer monitoring
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - continue 5-FU
   # Leukocytosis: Continuing to downtrend. Likely infectious vs. hx of
   steroids.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for antibiotic coverage
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - check albumin
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Back at baseline hematocrit, which is in the high 20s.
   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - not in DIC, not hemolyzing, low reticulocyte count
   - continue iron supplements, folate
   # Hyponatremia: possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in the setting of
   squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process)
   - Urine Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor, stable
   # Back Pain:  Patient was receiving morphine PCA on floor for acute
   compression fractures.
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure due to right lower lobe atelectasis/mucous plugging, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and worsening pulmonary effusions. These factors have limited lung re-expansion. The patient is now intubated nasotracheally and on positive pressure ventilation (PSV). The plan is to decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated, attempt a decrease in PEEP if stable, repeat ABG, and attempt spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) over the weekend if the respiratory support index (RSBI) score is low. Weaning from the ventilator may be necessary, but the patient may require a tracheostomy for airway control.

2. Bilateral Effusions: The patient initially had increased bilateral effusions due to fluid resuscitation. The effusions are currently decreasing, and the patient is diuresing well. The plan is to continue current ventilator settings, assess for possible extubation, and follow up with renal function.

3. Septic Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock secondary to sepsis in the setting of pneumonia. His blood pressure is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue, admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. He is currently intubated nasotracheally and on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a FiO2 of 40%. His recent ABG showed a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 41, PaO2 of 193, and HCO3- of 27 mEq/L. The patient has decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung field with rales heard over the right lateral lobe, while the left side is clear. Other findings include mild sedation, tachycardia, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, and warm well-perfused extremities.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial hypoxic respiratory failure was due to right lower lobe atelectasis/mucus plugging, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and worsening pulmonary effusions limiting lung re-expansion. The patient is now stable on PSV with a FiO2 of 40%. There is a high risk of sinusitis/infection with the nasotracheal tube in the presence of neutropenia. Consults for possible tracheostomy and follow-up BAL cultures for HAP are planned. E."

   Complex critically ill 60 yo man with invasive oral sq cell carcinoma
   currently requiring mechanical ventilatory support. We are treating
   with chemotherapy in hopes of reducing the size of the tumor. Our
   concern is that he will be getting neutropenic in the near future and
   we have completed his course of antibiotics. He is s/p trach and we
   will try to wean from mechanical ventilation to trach collar today.
   Continue nutrition via PEG. Will d/c CVL today.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  likely occurred secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli. Occurred in
   setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary
   effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Barriers to
   extubation include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral
   opening and sedation, and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue,
   necessitating a trach. - consult IP and radiology for possible trach
   this weekend
   - s/p tracheostomy
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (today  is the last day)
   - continue to attempt decrease his ventilator dependence
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diureses using albumin and
   lasix.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - Attemp goal of 1L negative balance today
   .
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - finish last day of 5-FU (started on [**8-17**])
   - touch base with oncology regarding the interaction between chemo
   drugs and all the vitamins he is currently receiving
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Resolved. Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of
   pneumonia.  BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently
   with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - f/u with oncology recs considering length of CVL placement
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures

   # Leukocytosis: Now trending down, heading toward leukopenia. Likely
   secondary to chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.

   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role. He is not in DIC, not hemolyzing, and
   presents with low reticulocyte count.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. 

The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including tracheostomy, placement of a PEG tube for nutrition, CVL (central venous line) placement, and ileostomy. He is on mechanical ventilatory support and has received chemotherapy to reduce the size of the tumor. 

The patient's medical history includes worsening pulmonary edema post-BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage), which responded well to diuretics and increasing PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). He also had leukocytosis, which is now trending down, and septic shock, which has resolved. 

The patient's current medications include antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin) for a respiratory infection, sedatives (Midazolam and Fentanyl), heparin for DVT prophylaxis, lansoprazole for GERD, and bupropion and citalopram for depression. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91-166 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

His laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 13.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 187 K/uL, blood glucose of 116 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and sodium of 135 mEq/L. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, warm and well-perfused extremities, and clear urine output. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for hypoxic respiratory failure, weaning off mechanical ventilation, and continued chemotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's potential medical complications include neutropenia due to chemotherapy, worsening pulmonary edema, septic shock, leukocytosis, anemia, malnutrition, and hyponatremia."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
   oropharynx and tongue is here in ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  likely occurred secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli. Occurred in
   setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary
   effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Patient now
   intubated nasotracheally, on PS and stable.  Barriers to extubation
   include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation, and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue, necessitating
   a trach. Even if he can be safely extubated, he likely will need trach
   anyway given his risk of aspiration in the setting of high tumor burden
   and nausea associated with his future chemo therapy. With his WBC
   trending down, It wold be safer to trach pt when his WBC is still
   within normal range. Also, would not be ideal to leave a nasotracheal
   tube in when pt is leukopenic.
   - consult IP and radiology for possible trach this weekend
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - continue to attempt decrease his ventilator dependence
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diurese using albumin and
   lasix.  Now slightly more effusions on CXR.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - Attemp goal of 1L negative balance today
   .
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - finish last day of 5-FU
   - touch base with oncology regarding the interaction between chemo
   drugs and all the vitamins he is currently receiving
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Resolved. Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of
   pneumonia.  BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently

   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures

   # Leukocytosis: Now trending down, heading toward leukopenia. Likely
   secondary to chemotherapy.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
- Heart rate: 104 bpm (normal range: 84-123 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 101/53 mmHg (normal range: 91/46-166/90 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 7 breaths per minute (normal range: 7-21 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient is intubated nasotracheally and on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. The reason for intubation is due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has bilateral pulmonary effusions, which have improved after fluid resuscitation but are still present on chest X-ray.

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 13.2 K/uL (normal range: 8.6-5.9 K/uL)

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
   oropharynx and tongue is here in ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Most likely occurred secondary to
   aspiration pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli.
   Occurred in setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening
   pulmonary effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Patient
   now intubated nasotracheally, on PS and stable.  Barriers to extubation
   include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation, and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue, necessitating
   a trach. Even if he can be safely extubated, he likely will need trach
   anyway given his risk of aspiration in the setting of high tumor burden
   and nausea associated with his future chemo therapy. With his WBC
   trending down, It wold be safer to trach pt when his WBC is still
   within normal range. Also, would not be ideal to leave a nasotracheal
   tube in when pt is leukopenic.
   - consult IP and radiology for possible trach this weekend
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - continue to attempt decrease his ventilator dependence
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diurese using albumin and
   lasix.  Now slightly more effusions on CXR.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - Attemp goal of 1L negative balance today
   .
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - finish last day of 5-FU
   - touch base with oncology regarding the interaction between chemo
   drugs and all the vitamins he is currently receiving
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Resolved. Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of
   pneumonia.  BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently
   with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - f/u with oncology recs considering length of CVL placement
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Now trending down, heading toward leukopenia. Likely
   secondary to chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Back at baseline hematocrit, which is in the high 20s.
   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role. He is not in DIC, not hemolyzing, and
   presents with low reticulocyte count.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - continue iron supplements, folate for now, touch base with oncology
   whether they interfere with chemotherapy.
   # Hyponatremia: Currently stable. Possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in
   the setting of squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process). Urine
   Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor
   # Back Pain:
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

Barriers to extubation include poor clearance of oral secretions and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue, necessitating a tracheostomy.

2. Bilateral Effusions: The patient initially had increased effusions due to fluid resuscitation, but they have improved after gentle diuresis using albumin and lasix. However, they are still present on the chest X-ray.

3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx and Tongue: The patient continues chemotherapy for his cancer. It is important to touch base with oncology regarding recommendations and the interaction between chemotherapy drugs and the vitamins he is currently receiving.

4. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock has resolved. He is stable overnight without requiring pressors, and his blood pressure is within normal limits. He has a PICC line and central venous line (CVL) for access.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
   oropharynx and tongue is here in ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  likely occurred secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli. Occurred in
   setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary
   effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Barriers to
   extubation include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral
   opening and sedation, and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue,
   necessitating a trach. - consult IP and radiology for possible trach
   this weekend
   - s/p tracheostomy, try to wean off mechanical ventilation to trach
   collar today.
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (today  is the last day)
   - continue to attempt decrease his ventilator dependence
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diureses using albumin and
   lasix.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - Attemp goal of 1L negative balance today
   .
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - finish last day of 5-FU (started on [**8-17**])
   - watch for neutropenia
   - vitamin C d/ced yesterday
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Resolved. Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of
   pneumonia.  BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently
   with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - f/u with oncology recs considering length of CVL placement
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Now trending down, heading toward leukopenia. Likely
   secondary to chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Back at baseline hematocrit, which is in the high 20s.
   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role. He is not in DIC, not hemolyzing, and
   presents with low reticulocyte count.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - continue iron supplements, folate for now, touch base with oncology
   whether they interfere with chemotherapy.
   # Hyponatremia: Currently stable. Possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in
   the setting of squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process). Urine
   Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor
   # Back Pain:
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He is in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely experienced this secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E. coli. This occurred in the setting of right lower lobe atelectasis/mucus plugging, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and worsening pulmonary effusions limiting lung re-expansion. Barriers to extubation include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and sedation, as well as tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue, necessitating a tracheostomy.

2. Bilateral Effusions: The patient initially had increased bilateral effusions in the setting of fluid resuscitation given low albumin. These improved after gentle diuresis using albumin and Lasix.

3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx and Tongue: The patient has squamous cell carcinoma that requires continued chemotherapy.

4. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock has resolved. It was likely secondary to sepsis in the setting of pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure has been stable overnight without the need for pressors. Currently, the patient has a PICC line and CVL for access.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
   oropharynx and tongue is here in ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and hypotension.
   .
   Started chemo [**8-17**] (taxotere), with planned several days 5FU. Was
   re-bronched [**8-18**] for anticipated clean out, but with underwhelming
   secretions - frothy - suspect cap leak [**1-19**] chemo), low CVP, required
   some pressors o/n, pan-cultured, pending. [**8-19**]: Worsening pulmonary
   edema post-BAL, responded well to diuresis and some increasing PEEP.
   [**8-20**]: Improvement with pulm edema/effusions c diuresis o/n with TBB
   negative -800, continuing to wean PEEP/O2. Leukocytosis improving,
   continuing ciprofloxacin through Sunday (for E. coli in BAL). Cont
   chemo (5FU). FiO2 and PEEP reduced - WBC trending down
   Overnight in ICU s/p Trach this AM - Tm 99.7 HR 80-104, SBP 91-166, RR
   11 Sat 95% PSV 5/PEEP 5/FiO2 .4, ABG 7.46/42/70. Sedated post-trach.
   Trach in place. Lungs cta, RRR, abd benign - PEG in place, ext no
   edema. Labs WBC 5.9K, HCT 27.4 PLT 105, K3.8, Cr .7. Cultures negative
   to date.
   Complex critically ill 60 yo man with invasive oral sq cell carcinoma
   currently requiring mechanical ventilatory support. We are treating
   with chemotherapy in hopes of reducing the size of the tumor. Our
   concern is that he will be getting neutropenic in the near future and
   we have completed his course of antibiotics. He is s/p trach and we
   will try to wean from mechanical ventilation to trach collar today.
   Continue nutrition via PEG. Will d/c CVL today.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  likely occurred secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli. Occurred in
   setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary
   effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Patient now
   intubated nasotracheally, on PS and stable.  Barriers to extubation
   include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation, and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue, necessitating
   a trach. Even if he can be safely extubated, he likely will need trach
   anyway given his risk of aspiration in the setting of high tumor burden
   and nausea associated with his future chemo therapy. With his WBC
   trending down, It wold be safer to trach pt when his WBC is still
   within normal range. Also, would not be ideal to leave a nasotracheal
   tube in when pt is leukopenic.
   - consult IP and radiology for possible trach this weekend
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - continue to attempt decrease his ventilator dependence
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diurese using albumin and
   lasix.  Now slightly more effusions on CXR.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.

   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - finish last day of 5-FU (started on [**8-17**])

   drugs and all the vitamins he is currently receiving

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
   oropharynx and tongue is here in ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Most likely occurred secondary to
   aspiration pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli.
   Occurred in setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening
   pulmonary effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Patient
   now intubated nasotracheally, on PS and stable.  Barriers to extubation
   include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral opening and
   sedation, and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue, necessitating
   a trach. Even if he can be safely extubated, he likely will need trach
   anyway given his risk of aspiration in the setting of high tumor burden
   and nausea associated with his future chemo therapy. With his WBC
   trending down, It wold be safer to trach pt when his WBC is still
   within normal range. Also, would not be ideal to leave a nasotracheal
   tube in when pt is leukopenic.
   - consult IP and radiology for possible trach this weekend
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% as tolerated
   - continue to attempt decrease his ventilator dependence
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diurese using albumin and
   lasix.  Now slightly more effusions on CXR.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - Attemp goal of 1L negative balance today
   .
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - finish last day of 5-FU
   - touch base with oncology regarding the interaction between chemo
   drugs and all the vitamins he is currently receiving
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Resolved. Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of
   pneumonia.  BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently
   with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - f/u with oncology recs considering length of CVL placement
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures

   # Leukocytosis: Now trending down, heading toward leukopenia. Likely
   secondary to chemotherapy.

   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - continue iron supplements, folate for now, touch base with oncology

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, bilateral effusions, septic shock (resolved), leukocytosis (trending down), malnutrition, anemia, hyponatremia, back pain, GERD, and depression. He is intubated nasotracheally and on positive pressure ventilation. His vital signs are stable, and he is receiving various medications for pain, sedation, and infection prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is further aspiration pneumonia or inadequate clearance of oral secretions.
2. Bilateral Effusions: The effusions may increase in size or worsen, potentially compromising lung re-expansion and leading to further respiratory distress.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is decreasing but may continue to trend towards leukopenia due to chemotherapy. This increases the risk of infection.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status may deteriorate without adequate enteral support.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen due to ongoing blood loss, chemotherapy, or nutritional deficiencies.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels may continue to fluctuate, potentially leading"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially require mechanical ventilation support.

2. B/L effusions: The patient initially had bilateral effusions, which improved after fluid resuscitation and diuresis. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's fluid balance and pulmonary status to prevent recurrence of effusions.

3. Squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue: The patient's underlying malignancy poses additional challenges in his management, including the need for ongoing chemotherapy and close collaboration with oncology.

4. Sepsis/Septic shock: The patient has had an episode of sepsis, which is now resolved. Monitoring for signs of infection and prompt management of any new infections is crucial to prevent a recurrence.

5. Leukocytosis and leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated (leukocytosis) but is trending down. However, it is heading toward leukopenia, likely secondary to chemotherapy. Continuous monitoring of the patient's blood counts is necessary to detect any significant changes.

   FINDINGS: There is a tracheostomy tube with tip 4.2 cm above the
   carina. Bilateral pleural effusions and increased interstitial and
   alveolar markings are again seen suggesting fluid overload. An
   underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
   oropharynx and tongue is here in ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  likely occurred secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli. Occurred in
   setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary
   effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Barriers to
   extubation include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral
   opening and sedation, and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue,
   necessitating a trach. - consult IP and radiology for possible trach
   this weekend
   - s/p tracheostomy, on trach collar today.
   - discontinue levoflox today
   - allow autodiurese
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diureses using albumin and
   lasix.
   - allow autodiurese
   - Attemp goal of 1L negative balance today
   .
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo (finshed 5-FU yesterday)
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - watch for neutropenia
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Resolved. Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of
   pneumonia.  BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently
   with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - d/c CVL today if oncology is ok with it
   - d/c levofloxacin
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Now trending down, heading toward leukopenia. Likely
   secondary to chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Back at baseline hematocrit, which is in the high 20s.
   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role. He is not in DIC, not hemolyzing, and
   presents with low reticulocyte count.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if Hct <25
   - continue iron supplements, folate for now, touch base with oncology
   whether they interfere with chemotherapy.
   # Hyponatremia: Currently stable. Possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in
   the setting of squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process). Urine
   Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor
   # Back Pain:
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He is in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has undergone several medical interventions and treatments.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely experienced hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. This occurred due to right lower lobe atelectasis/mucus plugging, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and worsening pulmonary effusions limiting lung re-expansion.

2. Septic Shock: The patient had septic shock, which has since resolved. It was likely secondary to sepsis in the setting of pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure stabilized overnight, and he no longer requires pressor support. He currently has a PICC line and CVL for access.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had leukocytosis, which is now trending down and heading toward leukopenia. This is likely secondary to chemotherapy.

4. Malnutrition: The patient presented with dehydration and has had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for nutritional support.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, with a hematocrit back at baseline in the high 20s. It is normocytic, and the etiology is unclear. However, it may be related to malignancy, ileostomy, possible nutritional deficiencies, or"

   FINDINGS: There is a tracheostomy tube with tip 4.2 cm above the
   carina. Bilateral pleural effusions and increased interstitial and
   alveolar markings are again seen suggesting fluid overload. An
   underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
   oropharynx and tongue is here in ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  likely occurred secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli. Occurred in
   setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary
   effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.
   - s/p tracheostomy, on trach collar today.
   - discontinue levoflox today
   - allow autodiurese
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diureses using albumin and
   lasix.
   - allow autodiurese
   - Attemp goal of 1L negative balance today
   .
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - finshed 5-FU yesterday
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - watch for neutropenia
   - start Neupogyn tonight
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Resolved. Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of
   pneumonia.  BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently
   with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - d/c CVL today if oncology is ok with it
   - d/c levofloxacin
   - normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Now trending down, heading toward leukopenia. Likely
   secondary to chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor on Neupogyn
   - d/c foley, cvl (after onc consult)
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Back at baseline hematocrit, which is in the high 20s.
   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role. He is not in DIC, not hemolyzing, and
   presents with low reticulocyte count.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if Hct <25
   - continue iron supplements, folate for now, touch base with oncology
   whether they interfere with chemotherapy.
   # Hyponatremia: Currently stable. Possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in
   the setting of squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process). Urine
   Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor
   # Back Pain:
   - continue morphine for pain control
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension.
- The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, which likely caused the hypoxic respiratory failure. The sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E. coli.
- The patient underwent tracheostomy and is currently on a trach collar.
- The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which improved after gentle diuresis using albumin and lasix.
- The patient's septic shock has resolved, and the current focus is on monitoring urine output and blood pressure.
- The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels and ensure adequate ventilation.
2. Bilateral Pleural Effusions: The patient has had persistent bilateral pleural effusions. This can be managed by continuing gentle diuresis and monitoring fluid balance.
3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx and Tongue: The patient has ongoing treatment for squamous cell carcinoma. Regular follow-up with oncology is necessary to monitor the effectiveness of chemotherapy and watch for neutropenia.
4. Leukocytosis/Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count"

   FINDINGS: There is a tracheostomy tube with tip 4.2 cm above the
   carina. Bilateral pleural effusions and increased interstitial and
   alveolar markings are again seen suggesting fluid overload. An
   underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
   oropharynx and tongue is here in ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  likely occurred secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia. Sputum was positive for pan-sensitive E.coli. Occurred in
   setting of RLL atelectasis/mucous plugging, HAP, worsening pulmonary
   effusions limiting re-expansion of the lung love.  Barriers to
   extubation include poor clearance of oral secretions due to oral
   opening and sedation, and tumor burden in the oropharynx and tongue,
   necessitating a trach. - consult IP and radiology for possible trach
   this weekend
   - s/p tracheostomy, try to wean off mechanical ventilation to trach
   collar today.
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (today  is the last day)
   - continue to attempt decrease his ventilator dependence
   .
   # B/L effusions: initially increased in setting of fluid resuscitation,
   given low albumin.  Improved after gentle diureses using albumin and
   lasix.
   - continue current vent settings with PS, mdis and pulm toliet.
   - Attemp goal of 1L negative balance today
   .
   # Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oropharynx and tongue:  continue
   chemotherapy.
   - continue chemo
   - touch base with oncology regarding recommendations
   - finish last day of 5-FU (started on [**8-17**])
   - watch for neutropenia
   - vitamin C d/ced yesterday
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Resolved. Likley secondary to sepsis in setting of
   pneumonia.  BP stable overnight, no pressors requirement.  Currently
   with PICC line and CVL for access.
   - f/u with oncology recs considering length of CVL placement
   - switch to levoflox for resp infection (tomorrow is the last day)
   - Normotensive overnight.  Continue to monitor urine outpt
   - IVF boluses for target MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - followup blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Now trending down, heading toward leukopenia. Likely
   secondary to chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   # Malnutrition:  Patient presented with dehydration now s/p PEG tube
   placement for nutritional support.
   - continue tube feeds
   - nutrition following
   # Anemia:  Back at baseline hematocrit, which is in the high 20s.
   Normocytic.  Unclear etiology but in setting of malignancy, and
   ileostomy, with possible nutritional deficiencies. Anemia of
   inflammation also plays a role. He is not in DIC, not hemolyzing, and
   presents with low reticulocyte count.
   - active type and screen
   - consider transfusion if ScVO2 below 70
   - continue iron supplements, folate for now, touch base with oncology
   whether they interfere with chemotherapy.
   # Hyponatremia: Currently stable. Possibly [**1-19**] hypovolemia vs SIADH (in
   the setting of squamous cell ca of lung vs. pulmonary process). Urine
   Na 25 and Urine Osm 798.
   - continue to monitor
   # Back Pain:
   - fentanyl for sedation and pain control while intubated
   # GERD:
   - continue lansoprazole
   # Depression:
   - continue bupropion and citalopram

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and tongue. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, placement of a PEG tube for nutritional support, and CVL placement for access. He is being treated for aspiration pneumonia caused by pan-sensitive E. coli and has shown improvement after gentle diuresis using albumin and lasix. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to require mechanical ventilation. His lab results show leukocytosis trending down, heading toward leukopenia likely secondary to chemotherapy, as well as anemia, malnutrition, hyponatremia, and back pain. He is also being managed for GERD, depression, and stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased production of purulent secretions, and worsening oxygenation is important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses, skin changes, and monitoring of D-dimer levels can help identify this complication.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged bed rest and impaired mobility"
