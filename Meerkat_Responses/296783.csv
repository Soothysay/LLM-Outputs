","Summary:
The patient is a 211-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented to the CCU in cardiogenic shock and is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient was successfully converted to sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion and is being maintained on amiodarone. Metoprolol and diltiazem are also part of her medication regimen.

Assessment and Plan:
1. RHYTHM: Maintain sinus rhythm due to the patient's stiff ventricle and aortic stenosis.
- Convert amiodarone to oral administration in the morning.
- Restart metoprolol when hemodynamic stability allows.
- Consider restarting diltiazem if blood pressure and heart rate permit.

2. PUMP: Evaluate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55% and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) >18 mmHg, moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), severe aortic stenosis (AS) with valve area 0.8-1.0, and moderate PA hypertension.
- Review echo to assess AS severity.
- Consider diuresis when blood pressure allows.
- Restart beta-blockers (BB) when blood pressure allows.
- Minimize fluid administration.

3. Coronaries: No wall motion abnormalities seen on echo.
- Continue monitoring.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:  First of all, she does not have
   anything resembling severe aortic stenosis.  Her AS is moderate at
   most.  Her LV is vigorous and hypertrophic (and stiff) and a reasonably
   enthusiastic effort should be made to keep her in sinus rhythm.
   However, I do not think she should get amiodarone for more than one
   month.  This is periop a-fib and should not require aggressive
   antiarrhythmic therapy once remote from the trigger.  Call out to floor
   today.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   DNR status discussed. DNR.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR), diastolic heart failure, and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient presented to the CCU in cardiogenic shock and received DC cardioversion along with an amiodarone drip. She converted to sinus rhythm and is currently hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thromboembolism: Given the patient's history of AFib, there is an increased risk of clot formation, which can lead to thromboembolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation therapy should be considered after assessing bleeding risks.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, and her condition may worsen due to the increased workload on the heart caused by AS. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is essential.
3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has moderate AS, which may progress and cause symptoms like syncope, chest pain, or heart failure. Regular follow-up and assessment of AS severity are necessary.
4. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's serum creatinine level has increased from 1.7 to 2.4, indicating acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency. Adequate perfusion and management of blood pressure are crucial to improve renal function.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and diastolic heart failure who presented to the CCU in cardiogenic shock due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib w/ RVR).
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate (HR) of 95 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 118/54 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 90% on 3 L nasal cannula.
- The patient's physical examination revealed a harsh systolic ejection murmur, regular rhythm, crackles in the bases of the lungs bilaterally, a soft abdomen with mild distension, and no peripheral edema or extremity abnormalities.
- The patient's laboratory results showed elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr), with Cr increasing from 1.7 to 2.4 mg/dL. Other lab values were within normal ranges.
- The patient's cardiac rhythm was converted to sinus rhythm after a single dose of direct current (DC) cardioversion, and she continues to receive amiodarone infusion.
- The patient's pump function is compromised, with a left ventricular ejection fraction ("

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, and aortic stenosis. She presented to the CCU in cardiogenic shock and was converted to sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion. The patient's current assessment includes several conditions:

1. Rhythm: The patient converted to sinus rhythm after receiving DC cardioversion and amiodarone drip. She remains in sinus rhythm.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with a recent stabilization at an approximate mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55-60. Multiple medication changes may contribute to this hypotension, but sepsis and cardiogenic shock should also be considered.

3. Fever: The patient had a spike temperature of 101.6 degrees yesterday, which could be secondary to resolving pneumonia or blood in the hip. She is currently afebrile without leukocytosis, and urine Cxs are negative. C. diff is negative as well.

4. PUMP: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is greater than 55%, and her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is above 18. There is moderate aortic stenosis, and the patient has poor output with Lasix.

5. Coronaries: No wall motion abnormalities are seen on echo.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of aortic stenosis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented to the CCU in cardiogenic shock and was successfully converted to sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion. She is currently hemodynamically stable but continues to experience hypotension and decreased urine output. The patient also has multifocal pneumonia, anemia of chronic inflammation, thrombocytosis, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. She underwent fixation of a hip fracture and is receiving pain management with Tylenol and oxycodone. The patient is on multiple medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, furosemide, and prophylactic heparin. She is also receiving antibiotics and Flagyl for fever. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing hypotension suggest ongoing cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's decreased urine output, muddy brown casts on urine microscopy, and rising creatinine levels indicate the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which can lead to renal failure.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and multifocal pneumonia indicate an ongoing infection, which could worsen if not appropriately treated.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia of chronic inflammation"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:  echocardiogram shows dilated
   hypocontractile right ventricle and a small hyperdynamic left
   ventricle.  These findings, given the clinical setting are highly
   suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism postop hip surgery, and we will
   start heparin.  However she remains DNR and her overall prognosis
   remains very poor.
   DNR status discussed. DNR.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation who presented to the CCU in cardiogenic shock. She has been experiencing hypotension, decreased urine output, and multifocal pneumonia. 

24-hour events include the initiation of oxycodone/morphine, metoprolol, amiodarone, and lasix. The patient's fever spiked to 101.6, and she was started on Flagyl due to large smelly stools and abdominal tenderness. The patient's blood cultures showed no growth, and she is currently afebrile. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 79/40 mmHg to 145/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a face tent at 15L. 

Physical examination findings include a harsh 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, right-sided decreased peripheral pulses, crackles in the bases bilaterally, and mild abdominal distension. 

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, low hemoglobin, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly low platelet count. 

Radiology findings include bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray, which could be due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, and severe aortic stenosis. She presented to the CCU in cardiogenic shock and is currently hemodynamically stable. 

The patient's recent events include the initiation of oxycodone/morphine, metoprolol, and amiodarone, which seemed to drop blood pressure. Lasix was given but showed poor output. Urine microscopy revealed muddy brown casts, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic inflammation. The patient also had a fever spike of 101.6, and cultures were sent. 

The patient's allergies include a known allergy to Zithromax (azithromycin). Her last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and decreased urine output. Her heart rate is low, and her blood pressure is consistently low. Oxygen saturation is 94% on face tent. The patient has crackles in her bilateral lung bases, indicating possible fluid accumulation.

The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal insufficiency. White blood cell count is slightly elevated, and platelet count is within normal range. Sodium, potassium, and chloride levels are all within normal limits.

    CXR ([**8-29**]): Bibasilar opacities greater on the left side, could be due
   to atelectasis or aspiration pneumonia. There is no CHF. There is no
   advancing pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN [**Age over 90 211**] yo F w/ AS, diastolic HF presented to the CCU in
   cardiogenic shock in the setting of afib w/rvr.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt. converted to sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion x1 along
   with amiodarone drip.  Sinus all day yesterday.
   - Amiodarone 400mg PO BID
   - Metoprolol 25  mg TID,
   - Hold home Diltiazem 240mg Daily
   - Given bleeding risk will not start coumadin at this time.
   - ASA 325mg Daily
   .
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to multiple medication changes. BP
   seemed to decrease to MAPs of 50
s after morphine. However, sepsis and
   cardiogenic shock should also be considered. BP seemed to stabilize at
   approx. MAP 55-60 overnight.
   -          Continue to monitor, no fluids given ATN and hypervolemic
   status.
   -          Contact health care proxy to discuss central access,
   secondary health care proxy thought patient would not want lines.
   -          Consider Neosynephrine for hypotension if central line
   placent.
   -          FU blood cultures, FU Urine cultures,
   -          Continue antibiotics
   .
   #Fever: spike temperature to 101.6 yesterday. Pt with resolving
   Pneumonia. Large smelly stool with some abdominal tenderness, Flagyl
   started. Patient afebrile without leukocytosis. Urine Cxs Negative.  C.
   Diff negative. Most likely secondary to blood in hip. Afebrile
   overnight.
   -          Continue vanc/zosyn
   -          Continue Flagyl
   -          Blood cxs FU
   -          Urine cxs FU

   # PUMP:  (Echo with LVEF > 55% and PCWP >18, [**2-1**]+ MR, Severe AS (valve
   area 0.8-1.0)  Reviewed ECHO with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] who notes moderate aortic
   stenosis. Poor output with lasix.
   - FU CXR this AM
   - Restart metoprolol as above.
   - Minimize fluid
   .
   #Coronaries: No wall motion abnormalities seen on echo [**8-25**].

   # Multifocal PNA: Diagnosis per medicine team. Pt still with
   significant O2 requirement.  No sputum cultures sent, CXR infiltrate
   appears to be improving. Spike temperature [**8-30**] (101.6)
   - Continue Abx Day [**8-6**] (vanc and [**Doctor Last Name 9151**]/tazo), started [**8-25**].
   - Sputum culture
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Crt 3.3 this morning. ATN sp
   hypotension.
   - Will continue to monitor with daily Cr
   - Ensure appropriate BP and sinus rhythm

   Disposition: CCU for Now
","Summary:
The patient is a 211-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure, presenting to the CCU in cardiogenic shock. The patient was converted to sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion and is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, acute kidney injury, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a hip fracture. The patient is on multiple medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, heparin, and ASA. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, and there is a possibility of an infection due to pneumonia or other sources.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient presented to the CCU in cardiogenic shock and requires close monitoring of hemodynamics.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient has muddy brown casts in urine microscopy and an elevated creatinine level, suggesting acute tubular necrosis.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, which needs to be managed appropriately.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk of bleeding.
6. Hip Fracture: The patient had a recent hip fracture fixation and requires pain control and DVT prophylaxis.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and there is a need to monitor for resolution and treat any complications."
