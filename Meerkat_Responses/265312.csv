   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with recent pneumonectomy for SCCA in the setting of a
   history of COPD and now admitted with progressive respiratory distress
   in the setting of cough and worsening dyspnea.  CXR at rehab concerning
   for PNA and ABX started 2 days ago following Rx of Vanco/Zosyn.  He had
   significant and persistent respiratory distress in the setting of A-fib
   and has maintained tachycardia despite continued ABX, nebs and
   supplemental O2 support.  He required BIPAP support for persistent and
   worsening hypoxemia this morning.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with COPD, pneumonectomy and reasonable
   clinical history and CXR findings to suggest PNA.  Certainly metastatic
   involvement and lymphagiocarcinomatosis is possible but given acute
   changes will likely be rapid onset of changes consistent with acute
   infectious process.
   -Will continue with non-invasive ventilatory support
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -Follow up sputum cultures
   -Will continue with Solumedrol but COPD flare does not appear to be
   dominant pathology here and will have to evaluate change and tolerance
   on ventilator given nl PCO2 and exam
   2)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Continue Amiodarone
   -Continue with B-blocker
   -F/U ECG post intubation

   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admited to ICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB.
   Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: patient with poor reserve given recent
   right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical picture
   and images, likely pneumonia.  With recent hospitalizations and rehab
   stay will need to treat emperically for HAP.  Also on differential is
   COPD flair, PE, cong heart failure and mucous plugging/atelectasis. CTA
   negative for PE.  However with consolidation on CXR and PE exam
   findings pneumonia is most likely.

   # Hypotension: received 4L overnight, still hypotensive but maintaining
   MAPs >65. Sepsis versus hypovolemic.
   -continue bolus with 500 cc NS
   # COPD: possible flair but unlikely (see above).  No known PFTs.
   Patient recieved solu-medrol in ED.  On solmederol at home.
   -continue Solu-Medrol for now 125mg q8
   -nebs standing and PRN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of COPD who underwent a right pneumonectomy. He presented with increasing dyspnea and worsening oxygen requirement, and was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia requiring non-rebreather (NRB) oxygen therapy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 79/44 to 126/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated on assist-control ventilation and is receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 35.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 556 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 196 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention. These include:

1. Hypoxemia/Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of COPD and recent right pneumonectomy, both of which can contribute to respiratory distress. The presence of left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation suggests pneumonia as a possible cause. The patient is being"

   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB, now with
   findings on CTA concerning for air leak into the right chest.
   Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: patient with poor reserve given recent
   right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical picture
   and images, likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis.  With recent
   hospitalizations and rehab stay will need to treat empirically for
   HAP.  Also on differential is COPD flair, PE, cong heart failure and
   mucous plugging/atelectasis. CTA negative for PE but concerning for
   leak into right chest (post-operative dehiscence of right mainstem
   closure?).
   -continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP, broaden for atypicals with azithromycin
   -standing nebs
   -stop steroids
   -infectious work-up with sputum bacterial and viral cultures, urine
   legionella
   -establish arterial access
   -thoracics consult to evaluate right chest air leak, consider
   bronchoscopy
   -decrease PEEP as tolerated, may increase tidal volume to allow for
   better ventilation
   -repeat ABG later this morning
   # Hypotension: received 4L overnight, still hypotensive. Concern of
   evolving sepsis versus impaired cardiac output due to elevated
   intrathoracic pressure from possible bronchial leak
   -thoracics consult as above
   -establish central venous access and start Levophed
   -continue to bolus with IVF for goal MAP >60
   # Acute renal failure: likely prerenal in setting of sepsis, decreased
   renal perfusion
   -check urine electrolytes
   -renal consult
   -IVF as above
   -treat hyperkalemia with insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate
   # Elevated INR:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of COPD who underwent a right pneumonectomy and is now experiencing increasing dyspnea and worsening oxygen requirements. The patient was found to have a left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation at rehab and was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia requiring non-rebreather (NRB) mask. The CTA showed no pulmonary embolism but indicated air leak into the right chest, suggesting post-operative dehiscence of the right mainstem closure.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia with evolving sepsis and requires treatment empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Other possible differentials include COPD exacerbation, pulmonary embolism (PE), congestive heart failure (CHF), and mucous plugging/atelectasis. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status.

The plan includes continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for HAP, broadening the coverage for atypical organisms with azithromycin, stopping steroids, performing infectious work-up with sputum bacterial and viral cultures, urine legionella, establishing arterial access, and consulting thoracics to evaluate the right chest air leak and consider bronchoscopy.

The patient also has acute renal failure likely due to prerenal causes such as sepsis and decreased renal perfusion. The treatment involves checking"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with h/o COPD and also pneumonectomy now presenting with
   multfocal PNA in remaining lung.  His initial presentation was one of
   progressive respiratory distress and subsequent respiratory failure
   with both COPD, impaired baseline function and multifocal PNA driving
   respiratory failure.  Of note he also has had signficiant hypotension
   which is secondary to significant impairment in right sided heart
   function as well as progression of pneumonia to septic shock despite 5
   liters IVF fluid resuscitation.  Patient has had substantial
   detrioration across the night
likely representing a worsening of
   ventilation in the setting of multifocal PNA and severe COPD and with
   severe respiratory acidosis.  In addition patient has had worsening
   hypotension which appears to be a manifestation of evolving sepsis
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-
   -Pneumonia
will continue with Vanco/Zosyn, will send sputum culture and
   viral cultures
inculding influenze and given concern for possible
   atypical bacterial organisms including Mycoplasma and Chlamydia.  Will
   need to consider bronch to eval significant air leak into right chest
   and if performed or unable to get a sample
will need to stabilize
   ventilation as possible
   -COPD-Resistance and compliance to this point do appear to be
   reasonable, wheezing is minimal so will D/C systemic steroids at this
   point given minimal evidence of significant and persistent
   bronchospasm.
   -Hypercarbia
have moved to RR at 24-28 which appears maximum and based
   on ABG will need to consider further increase in Vt from 320
360 if
   needed
   -Hypoxemia
Will have to decrease PEEP as close to 0 as tolerated with
   evidence of significant air leak into right chest.  Will maintain FIO2

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of COPD and pneumonectomy.
- He presented with progressive respiratory distress and subsequent respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia in the remaining lung, impaired baseline function, and severe COPD.
- The patient also has significant hypotension secondary to impairment in right-sided heart function and progression of pneumonia to septic shock.
- The patient's condition has deteriorated across the night, indicating worsening ventilation in the setting of multifocal pneumonia and severe COPD, along with severe respiratory acidosis.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 85/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia and severe COPD. The plan includes continuing with Vancomycin and Zosyn, sending sputum culture and viral cultures, and considering a bronchoscopic evaluation to assess significant air leak into the right chest.
2. Sepsis: The patient likely has sepsis secondary to significant pulmonary infection with systemic insult now evolving despite antibiotics and fluids given. The plan includes changing to central pressors and CVP measurements, addressing all sources of infection, and checking for DIC labs.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB, now with
   findings on CTA concerning for air leak into the right chest.
   Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: patient with poor reserve given recent
   right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical picture
   and images, likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis.  With recent
   hospitalizations and rehab stay will need to treat empirically for
   HAP.  Also on differential is COPD flair, PE, cong heart failure and
   mucous plugging/atelectasis. CTA negative for PE but concerning for
   leak into right chest (post-operative dehiscence of right mainstem
   closure?).
   -continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP, broaden for atypicals with azithromycin
   -standing nebs
   -stop steroids
   -infectious work-up with sputum bacterial and viral cultures, urine
   legionella
   -establish arterial access
   -thoracics consult to evaluate right chest air leak, consider
   bronchoscopy
   -decrease PEEP as tolerated, may increase tidal volume to allow for
   better ventilation
   -repeat ABG later this morning
   # Hypotension: received 4L overnight, still hypotensive. Concern of
   evolving sepsis versus impaired cardiac output due to elevated
   intrathoracic pressure from possible bronchial leak
   -thoracics consult as above
   -establish central venous access and start Levophed
   -continue to bolus with IVF for goal MAP >60
   # Acute renal failure: likely prerenal in setting of sepsis, decreased
   renal perfusion
   -check urine electrolytes
   -renal consult
   -IVF as above
   -treat hyperkalemia with insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate
   # Elevated INR:
   -will send for DIC panel, also check liver enzymes
   # COPD: possible flair but unlikely (see above).  No known PFTs.
   Patient recieved solu-medrol in ED.  On solmederol at home.
   -stop steroids today
   -nebs standing and PRN
   # A-Fib: recent dx per patient.  Possibly occurring in peri-op time.
   Patient on amiodarone 200mg until [**5-2**].  Also on metoprolol 37.5.
   -holding metoprolol due to hypotension
   -hold anticoagulation for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of COPD who underwent a right pneumonectomy and presented with increasing dyspnea and worsening oxygen requirement. He was found to have a left lower lobe consolidation and admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia requiring nonrebreather oxygen. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with findings on CT angiography suggesting an air leak into the right chest. The assessment suggests pneumonia with evolving sepsis, possibly due to post-operative dehiscence of the right mainstem closure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite receiving 4 liters of fluid overnight. This could be due to evolving sepsis or impaired cardiac output caused by elevated intrathoracic pressure from a bronchial leak.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient may be at risk for acute renal failure, likely prerenal in nature, due to decreased renal perfusion in the setting of sepsis.
3. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, which could indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver dysfunction.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory distress and further deterioration of his condition.
5. Sepsis: Given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, there is a concern for sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia, clinical status continuing
   to worsen.
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with poor reserve given
   recent right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical
   picture and images, likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis and
   complicated by pulmonary embolism and air-fluid level in R
   pneumonectomy cavity s/p chest tube placement.
   -Continue Vanc and azithromycin for PNA, change Zosyn to Meropenem for
   coverage of ESBL
   -F/u pending micro including from bronch
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, f/u LENIs
   -Chest tube in place; f/u Thoracics recs
   -Steroids discontinued [**4-22**] as COPD likely major component; continue
   standing nebs
   -Increasing PEEP or trial of PS are remaining options in optimizing
   respiratory status
   # Hypotension: Likely with components from sepsis unresponsive to
   current abx, cardiogenic given arrythmia, anatomic given R pleural
   cavity process.
   -Broaden abx coverage as above
   -Continue amiodarone gtt for Afib (can d/c home po dose)
   -Continue chest tube and f/u Thoracics recs
   -Ability to fluid resuscitate limited by respiratory status; can try
   small boluses as tolerated
   -Continue pressors which are currently maxed out; dobutamine would be
   option but run risk of increasing susceptibility to arrhythmia
   # Acute renal failure: Rapid decline
   -Appreciate renal recs
   -Disinclined to offer dialysis as not medically reasonable option given
   overall clinical status
   # Elevated INR: Negative for DIC, may be [**1-26**] shock liver.
   # A-Fib: Recent dx per patient in setting of pneumonectomy. Plan had
   been for amiodarone 200mg until [**5-2**]
   -Started on amiodarone gtt as above nt on
   -Holding metoprolol due to hypotension
   -Holding anticoagulation for now
   # Lung Ca: Recent Dx of squameous cell lung cancer s/p pneumonectomy.
   Unclear if disease metastatic.  Nothing to do for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of COPD who underwent a right pneumonectomy. He presented with increasing dyspnea, worsening oxygen requirement, and was found to have a left lower lobe consolidation. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia, and his clinical status continued to worsen.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypoxemia/Respiratory Distress: The patient has poor reserve given the recent pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD. There is a likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis and complicated by a pulmonary embolism and an air-fluid level in the right pneumonectomy cavity after chest tube placement.

2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension due to sepsis unresponsive to current antibiotics, cardiogenic causes related to arrhythmia, and anatomic causes related to right pleural cavity process.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a rapid decline in renal function.

4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, which may be secondary to [1-26] shock liver.

5. Atrial Fibrillation (A-Fib): The patient was recently diagnosed with A-Fib in the setting of pneumonectomy. The plan was to administer amiodarone 200mg until [5-2], but due to hypotension, metop"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with h/o lung cancer and s/p right pneumonectomy and with
   severe COPD who has significant multi-lobar PNA in the left lung
   leading to respiratory failure and sepsis.  This is complicated by PE,
   Right heart compromise, Atrial Fibrillation, pneumothorax in right
   pneumonectomy space and acute renal failure. Importantly he has had
   conservative ventilation strategy with some improvement in ventilation
   but has had worsening and refractory hypoxemia.  This may be a
   manifestation of worsening impact from pneumonia and lung injury
   despite low Vt ventilation and PEEP optimization in the setting of leak
   into right chest.   By problem will-->
   1)Respiratory Failure
   PNA-_Vancomycin/Zosyn
Change to Meropenem empirically this morning
   COPD--Alb/Atrovent to contiue
   He has ongoing drainage from chest tube but minimal evidence of ongoing
   brisk air leak based upon no air leak in tube an full return volume
   seen.
   Collapse
CXR shows a strong suggestion of LLL consolidation and
   collapse based on CXR and this would be the likely primary driver of
   his worsening hypoxemia with PE less likely.
   PEEP
will increase in the absence of ongoing leak and severe
   hypoxemia
Increase PEEP to 10
   2)Sepsis/Shock-_Despite volume and pressors patient has clear worsening
   of tissue hypo-perfusion with elevations in lactate seen.  This is
   likely sepsis/hypovolemic and cardiogenic at the onset with right heart
   failure
   -Levophed/Vasopressin/Phenylephrine
   -HYdrocortisone IV started for hypotension as empiric intervention with
   refractory shock.
   -Volume replete
CVP at 16
   -Will trial fluild bolus only if refractory to pressors
as he has
   anuria, elevated CVP
   -Are working to control impact of A-fib and impact of PE with Rx as
   below
   -Will repeat blood cultures at this time despite no fevers noted
   3)Acute Renal Failure-_Creatinine continues to rise-this is combination
   of ATN and pre-renal source of failure.  This has persisted and is
   worsening.
   -Continue to support as above
   -No acute need for dialysis but volume overload may be at issue
   4)Pulmonary Embolism-Seen on CT, concern for DVT on right and risk of
   recurrent PE is overwhelming risk of death and heparin started in that
   setting.
   -Heparin to continue
   -Need to F/U on final read of LENI which prelim suggested DVT
   5)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Will continue with Amiodarone
   -Is incidentally on IV Heparin

at this time patient has severe and progressive
   multi-organ system failure.  This has progressed despite ongoing
   maximal medical therapy in the setting of pre-existing severe
   compromise in function with COPD and pneumonectomy.  Patient wishes as
   expressed are for continued full measures for treatment should there be
   a reasonable expectation of meaningful recovery which has been defined
   as return to independent living status.  Given overwhelming progression
   of multi-organ system failure despite optimal medical interventions
   this recovery would not appear to be reasaonable to expect.  This will
   be shared with family.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of lung cancer and previous right pneumonectomy who presented with severe COPD and multi-lobar pneumonia in the left lung leading to respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient also has a pulmonary embolism (PE), right heart compromise, atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), pneumothorax in the right pneumonectomy space, and acute renal failure. 

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has significant multi-lobar pneumonia leading to respiratory failure. Conservative ventilation strategies have been used, but the patient has worsening and refractory hypoxemia.
2. Sepsis/Shock: Despite fluid resuscitation and pressor support, the patient has clear worsening of tissue hypoperfusion with elevations in lactate, indicating sepsis/hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels continue to rise, indicating worsening renal failure due to a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and pre-renal causes.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a confirmed PE on CT scan, and there is concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the right side. Heparin has been started to prevent further PEs.
