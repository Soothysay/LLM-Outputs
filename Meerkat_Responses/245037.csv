   24 Hour Events:
 EEG - At [**2176-1-27**] 01:14 PM
   - Called [**Hospital 910**] Hospital at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10660**] #7915 (West 2). Risperidone
   caused prolonged QTc. Urine grew > 100,000 Enterococcus faecalis
   sensitive to Ampicillin, Nitrofurantoin, Vancomycin. Baseline BPs
   90-110/40-65.
   - Mental status improved in AM, less somnolent. Agitated pulling lines.
   Started Zyprexa without response. Haldol 0.5mg - 1mg.
   - Final CT Head: There are continued evolution of post-surgical
   changes, with decreasing pneumocephalus, decreasing edema surrounding
   the right frontal resection bed, as well as decreased hyperdensity
   within the resection bed representing resolving blood products. Tiny
   new hyperdensity within the resection bed likely represents resolving
   blood products. Otherwise, no acute intracranial hemorrhage or new
   edema is seen.
   - Final CXR: No pneumonia seen. Left hilar mass as before.
   - Neurosurgery: Restart Heparin SC, EEG, MRI with contrast.
   - Family updated and ICU consent signed.
   - MRI deferred until tomorrow given agitation and pressure support.
   - Meds (including steroids) converted to IV
   - EEG performed: Pending

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F s/p R frontal mass resection [**2176-1-12**] metastatic
   rhabdomyosarcoma presents with AMS and agitation.
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT stable s/p resection. Lesion/site of resection accounts for
   symptoms. Therefore mental status essentially as clear as might be
   expected based on CT findings. Delerium yesterday likely relates to
   underlying infection. Some signs likely resulting from edema and
   therefore some improvement necessary.
   - Treat urosepsis as below
   - Discontinue hydromorphone, limit sedating medications
   # Urosepsis
   Per discharge report from rehab enterococcus in urine. Unfortunately no
   urine culture sent in ED, Ua positive.
   - IVF 1 L NS
   - Start ampicillin for enterococcus coverage and ceftriaxone for e.coli
   -> can narrow once final cultures
   # s/p right frontal mass resection
   CT head changes consistent with post-op peroid, no acute changes.
   Neurosurgery evaluated in ED and felt no acute neurosurg issues.
   - Neurosurg to follow, appreciate input
   - Continue dexamethasone, Keppra
   - Xenaderm ointment to scar
   - Insulin sliding scale, Bactrim ppx while on dexamethasone
   # Malignancy: Patient with history of stage IV thoracic
   rhabdomyosarcoma currently on chemotherapy. Path from right frontal
   lesion confirms metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. Also history of L breast
   cancer - DCIS s/p lumpectomy.
   - Patient to follow-up cancer care as outpatient

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female who underwent a right frontal mass resection and is now presenting with altered mental status and agitation. She has a history of metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and previously had left breast cancer. The patient's urine culture showed >100,000 Enterococcus faecalis, which is sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin. Her vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and tachycardia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin, dexamethasone, and keppra. She has been experiencing urosepsis and her fluid balance has been monitored. Imaging studies show resolving blood products within the resection bed, decreased pneumocephalus, and no new edema or hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture for Enterococcus faecalis, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). If left untreated, this can lead to urosepsis or septic shock.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication side effects. If not managed properly, it can lead to organ failure and shock.
3. Agitation and Altered Mental Status: The patient's agitation and altered mental status could be attributed to the recent surgery, infection, or medication side effects. This may increase the risk of falls"

","The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis, known urinary tract infection (UTI) but refusing antibiotics at rehab, and altered mental status. The patient has shown improvement in recent days, including being on room air and regular diet, and having good urine output. However, there are still potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential complications include:
1. Persistent or worsening sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, and although they are showing improvement, there is still a risk of sepsis progressing or not fully resolving.
2. UTI flare-up: The patient has a known UTI caused by Enterococcus faecalis, which is sensitive to ampicillin. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection recurrence or worsening.
3. Neurological deficits: The patient has mild corticospinal tract syndrome on the left and parietal syndrome. These neurological deficits should be closely monitored for any changes or deterioration.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within the normal range, but monitoring for any episodes of hypotension is necessary to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
5. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is described as altered but not delirious, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of delirium or confusion.

Overall, the patient's condition seems to be improving, but close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and address"

   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT stable s/p resection. Lesion/site of resection accounts for
   symptoms. Therefore mental status essentially as clear as might be
   expected based on CT findings. Delerium yesterday likely relates to
   underlying infection. Some signs likely resulting from edema and
   therefore some improvement necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female who underwent a right frontal mass resection on January 12th due to metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. She presented with altered mental status and agitation. The head CT showed that the lesion/site of resection accounted for her symptoms. The patient's mental status has been improving, although she remains pleasantly confused and conversant. There are signs of mild corticospinal tract syndrome on the left and parietal syndrome. The patient is currently on a regular diet and off levophed. She has a history of stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma currently on chemotherapy and a history of left breast cancer - DCIS s/p lumpectomy. The urine culture grew >100,000 Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a known urinary tract infection (UTI) and is experiencing sepsis symptoms. It is crucial to treat the urosepsis promptly to prevent further complications.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be related to underlying infection, edema, or post-operative factors. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent delirium from worsening.
3. Malignancy: The patient has a history of metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer. Regular follow-up cancer care is essential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis, known urinary tract infection (UTI) but refusing antibiotics at a rehabilitation center, and altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU and has shown improvement in various aspects. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/56 to 121/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on room air and regular diet. 

The patient's neurologic examination reveals mild corticospinal tract syndrome on the left and parietal syndrome. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient's PT/PTT/INR values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a known UTI and altered mental status, which can be indicative of sepsis. It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory values to detect any worsening of the condition.
2. UTI: The patient's urine culture grew Enterococcus faecalis, which is sensitive to ampicillin. Since the patient has been on ampicillin, it is essential to assess if the infection is responding appropriately.
3. Hypotension:"

   rhabdomyosarcoma presents with AMS and agitation.
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT stable s/p resection. Lesion/site of resection accounts for
   symptoms. Therefore mental status essentially as clear as might be
   expected based on CT findings. Delerium yesterday likely relates to
   underlying infection. Some signs likely resulting from edema and
   therefore some improvement necessary.
   - Mental status continues to improve although pleasantly confused
   (close to baseline per family)
   - Continue to re-orient, OOB to chair etc.
   - Treat urosepsis as below
   - Discontinued hydromorphone yesterday, limit sedating medications
   # Urosepsis
   Per discharge report from rehab, enterococcus in urine. Unfortunately
   no urine culture sent in ED, although urinalysis was positive. Patient
   continues to do well off levophed
   - Discontinued Ceftriaxone for enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin
   - Start ampicillin for enterococcus coverage and ceftriaxone for e.coli
   -> can narrow once final cultures
   # s/p right frontal mass resection
   CT head changes consistent with post-op peroid, no acute changes.
   Neurosurgery evaluated in ED and felt no acute neurosurg issues.
   - Neurosurg to follow, appreciate input
   - Continue dexamethasone, Keppra
   - Xenaderm ointment to scar
   - Insulin sliding scale, Bactrim ppx while on dexamethasone
   # Malignancy: Patient with history of stage IV thoracic
   rhabdomyosarcoma currently on chemotherapy. Path from right frontal
   lesion confirms metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. Also history of L breast
   cancer - DCIS s/p lumpectomy.
   - Patient to follow-up cancer care as outpatient

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, who presented with altered mental status and agitation. She underwent a right frontal mass resection on 1/12/2176 and has been admitted to the ICU. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/56 to 121/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She is alert and oriented, but pleasantly confused and conversant. Physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, elevated jugular venous pressure, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and distended, with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination shows mild corticospinal tract syndrome on the left and parietal syndrome. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine level. Other labs are within normal range. The patient is being treated for urosepsis with ampicillin and ceftriaxone, and her mental status is improving. She has a history of breast cancer and is currently on chemotherapy for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient is expected to follow up with cancer care as an outpatient."

   70 y/o F s/p R frontal mass resection [**2176-1-12**] metastatic
   rhabdomyosarcoma presents with AMS and agitation.
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT stable s/p resection. Lesion/site of resection accounts for
   symptoms. Therefore mental status essentially as clear as might be
   expected based on CT findings. Delerium yesterday likely relates to
   underlying infection. Some signs likely resulting from edema and
   therefore some improvement necessary.
   - Mental status continues to improve although pleasantly confused
   (close to baseline per family)
   - Continue to re-orient, OOB to chair etc.
   - Treat urosepsis as below
   - Discontinued hydromorphone yesterday, limit sedating medications
   # Urosepsis
   Per discharge report from rehab, enterococcus in urine. Unfortunately
   no urine culture sent in ED, although urinalysis was positive. Patient
   continues to do well off levophed
   - Discontinued Ceftriaxone for enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin
   - Continue ampicillin Day 3
   # s/p right frontal mass resection
   CT head changes consistent with post-op peroid, no acute changes.
   Neurosurgery evaluated in ED and felt no acute neurosurg issues.
   - Neurosurgery continues to follow, appreciate input
   - Continue dexamethasone, Keppra
 will clarify with Neurosurgery
   planned course
   - Continue Bactrim ppx given dexamethasone
   - Xenaderm ointment to scar
   # Malignancy: Patient with history of stage IV thoracic
   rhabdomyosarcoma currently on chemotherapy. Path from right frontal
   lesion confirms metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. Also history of L breast
   cancer - DCIS s/p lumpectomy.
   - Patient to follow-up cancer care as outpatient ([**Hospital3 10687**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer, who presented with altered mental status and agitation after undergoing a right frontal mass resection. She has been diagnosed with enterococcus in her urine and is suspected to have urosepsis. The patient's mental status has been improving but she remains confused and pleasant. Her vital signs are stable, and she is off levophed. She is receiving antibiotics for the infection and will continue with her cancer treatment as an outpatient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient has enterococcus in her urine and is showing signs of urosepsis. It is important to monitor her vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate, and continue with appropriate antibiotic treatment.
2. Malignancy: The patient has a history of stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer. Regular follow-up and continuation of chemotherapy are necessary to manage her malignancy.
3. Post-operative complications: Although the patient's head CT is stable post-resection, there is a possibility of developing post-operative complications such as wound infection or cerebral edema. Monitoring the surgical site for any signs of infection and assessing neurologic status regularly is crucial.
4. Medication interactions: The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and corticosteroids (dexamethasone). It is important to monitor for any"

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Hemodyn stable but remains tachycardic.  BP appears at baseline and she
   is now almost even in I&O for LOS.  BUN 10.  No signs of vol depetion.
   Her echo last mo had a compressed RA but seems unlikely tach is due to
   preload.  Will check TFTs.
   Narrowing abx to cover enterococcus.  Will obtain cx from [**Hospital1 2801**] - given low colony ct and nl wbc on transfer still concerned this
   was not sepsis.
   Will speak with NSurg re prednisone dosing - should she receive PCP
   prophylaxis
