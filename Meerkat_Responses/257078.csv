   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure
   likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 3 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 10/5
   - daily risbi
   - wean vent as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy
   - Follow lactates
   - r/o MI
   - cortisol level
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - CT head without contrast
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, holding home medications of
   metoprolol and lisinopril.
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is an 89-year-old female with hypoxic respiratory failure.
- She has a history of recent anterior cerebral artery stroke and failed speech and swallow.
- The patient is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation.
- She was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, suggestive of septic shock secondary to pneumonia.
- Blood cultures show growth of Clostridium and Bacillus species, but C. diff is negative.
- The patient has multifocal right lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.
- She has an elevated white blood cell count and slightly elevated troponin levels.
- Other lab results are within normal limits.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by acute stress reaction due to pituitary macroadenoma.
- She is also being treated for anemia, hypocalcemia, and hypertension.
- The patient's family wants to continue feeding her, putting her at high risk for aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia and her inability to protect her airway due to failed speech and swallow.
2. Shock: The patient's initial presentation included fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, suggesting septic shock secondary to pneumonia.
3. Central Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a pituitary macroadenoma, which could cause central adrenal insufficiency. However, her"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia (pna). She has a history of shock, fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, which is most likely septic shock secondary to pna. Other possible complications that can arise include respiratory failure, neurologic complications due to recent right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) stroke, hypertension, thyroid dysfunction, anemia, hypocalcemia, and feeding intolerance.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory support plan including a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 61-145 beats per minute, blood pressure within normal limits, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has scattered rales and rhonchi on lung examination, indicating possible pulmonary infiltrates or fluid accumulation. The cardiac examination reveals a regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows no tenderness, distension, or organomegaly.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.4 K/uL, slightly elevated lactate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure
   likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 3 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 10/5
   - daily risbi
   - wean vent as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy
   - Follow lactates
   - r/o MI
   - cortisol level
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - CT head without contrast
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, holding home medications of
   metoprolol and lisinopril.
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline.
   - t & s
   .
   #  hypocalcemia: unclear cause, low albumin makes it difficult to
   assess.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted to the ICU with shock and respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia (pna). She has a recent history of right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) stroke and failed speech and swallow, making her at high risk for aspiration. Her vital signs include a temperature of 100.7°F, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 156/77 to 210/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume set at 350 mL. She is receiving antibiotics (Vanco & Zosyn) for suspected bacterial infection. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows multifocal right lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, shock (likely septic secondary to pna), acute mental status change (AMS), hypertension, thyroid dysfunction, anemia, hypocalcemia, and fluid/electrolyte management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and right lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray indicate pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Shock: The patient's initial presentation with fever, hypoxia,"

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypertension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, and pneumonia (aspiration vs nosocomial). 

The patient's vital signs show a fever, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and normal respiratory rate. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, HCO3- of 22 mEq/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 305, which suggests adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The physical examination reveals scattered rales and ronchi in the right lung, tachycardia with a normal sinus rhythm, and no murmurs or signs of heart failure. The patient has slight edema in the left arm and anasarca. Laboratory findings show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19.4 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, slightly low sodium of 137 mg/dL, low potassium of 3.5 mEq/L, and slightly elevated blood glucose of 135 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has received various medications including antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin), anticoagulants (heparin), diuretics (furosemide), and proton pump inhibitors (famotidine). The patient's daily fluid balance shows an intake of 3,534 mL and output of 2,575 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 959 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: Due to the patient's intubation and prolonged ICU stay, there is an increased risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to potentially fatal PE.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and intubation increase the risk of aspiration, leading to pneumonia.
4. Hypotension: Despite the current elevation in blood pressure, the patient may experience hypotension due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's lab results indicate low potassium and sodium levels, which require careful monitoring and management.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's clinical status, administer appropriate antibiotics"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure
   likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 3 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 10/5
   - daily risbi
   - wean vent as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy
   - Follow lactates
   - r/o MI
   - cortisol level
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - CT head without contrast
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, holding home medications of
   metoprolol and lisinopril.
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline.
   - t & s
   .
   #  hypocalcemia: unclear cause, low albumin makes it difficult to
   assess.
   - check ionized calcium
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; plan to replace A-line today.

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of right anterior cerebral artery infarct, stable sellar mass, no acute process. She presented with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, leading to a diagnosis of septic shock secondary to pneumonia. Other comorbidities include acute myocardial infarction, anemia, hypocalcemia, and thyroid dysfunction. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. She has been receiving IV antibiotics and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.2°C, heart rate 106 bpm, blood pressure 156/77 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 100%. The patient's physical examination shows scattered rales and rhonchi in the right lung, tachycardia with a normal rhythm, and mild edema in the left arm. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is being managed with early goal-directed therapy for septic shock, respiratory support, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and multifocal right lobe infiltrate on CXR suggest respiratory failure. This condition may worsen if the patient develops further lung infections or if the mechanical ventilation settings need adjustment.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure
   likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 4 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 5/5
   - daily RSBI
 93 this AM
   - Will attempt to extubate today
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - ABG after extubation
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be in fluid overload, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female who was admitted with shock and respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia (pna). The patient has a history of right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) stroke, speech and swallow difficulties, and a stable sellar mass. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 156/77 to 170s, heart rate around 106 bpm, respiratory rate between 22-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal continued evolution of the right ACA infarct without any new changes. The patient has been receiving various medications, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, heparin sodium, lasix, famotidine, and furosemide. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains hypoxic with multifocal right lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. She had a recent ACA stroke, failed speech and swallow, and is not considered a good candidate for tube feeds, putting her at high risk for aspiration. Urine and bronchoalve"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female admitted with pneumonia and resultant sepsis now with
   persistent ventilatory failure.  She has current barriers to extubation
   of mental status and volume overload.  She has had favorable RSBI and
   good stability of oxygenation and ventilation on support.  Despite
   significant altered mental status patient had CT without significant
   change.  She has had some increased response to stimulus in regards to
   gag reflex with suctioning but is unable to follow any commands.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE---Current barriers to be addressed as follows

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted with pneumonia and resultant sepsis, now experiencing persistent ventilatory failure. She has mental status alterations and volume overload. Despite altered mental status, the patient's CT scan showed no significant change. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has minimal secretions. The plan includes continuing with sedation hold, antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn), diuretics (Lasix), and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with gas exchange monitoring at 60 minutes. If the SBT is unfavorable, the patient may require additional diuretic therapy before re-attempting extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent ventilatory failure indicates a potential complication related to respiratory function.
2. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The presence of sepsis increases the risk of further complications such as organ dysfunction or septic shock.
3. Hypertension, Benign: The patient's high blood pressure may require management to prevent complications associated with hypertension.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder, Other: The patient's altered mental status and volume overload suggest a potential electrolyte and fluid disorder, which can lead to various complications.
5. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient's intermittent response to voice commands indicates a need for ongoing assessment and management of her altered mental status.
6. Pneumonia, Other: The aspiration vs nosocomial"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**5-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Extubated [**2127-3-6**] -> ABGs improving
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, so will continue Lasix as
   UOP has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; A-line
   # Code: presumed full
   # Communication: Patient's family
   # Disposition: to floor as respiratory status improves

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and pituitary adenoma. She was admitted with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia from a nursing home.

The patient's respiratory status has improved since extubation, with good oxygenation and ventilation parameters. However, she is at high risk for aspiration due to failed speech and swallow, and the family wants to continue feeding her.

She is currently receiving diuretic therapy with furosemide (Lasix) to manage fluid overload. Her metabolic alkalosis is being treated with acetazolamide. Hypotension is being managed by holding her home medications of metoprolol and lisinopril until she is extubated and diuresed.

The patient's anemia is at baseline levels, and her hypocalcemia has resolved. She has a history of goiter and low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels due to pituitary macroadenoma, but her free T4 levels are within normal range.

The patient's other conditions include acute myocardial infarction (AMI), central adrenal insufficiency, and acute kidney injury (AKI). These conditions are being managed with appropriate medications and interventions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 4 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 5/5
   - daily RSBI
 93 this AM
   - Will attempt to extubate today
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - ABG after extubation
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be in fluid overload, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 89-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU for shock and respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia (pna). The patient also had a recent anterior cerebral artery (ACA) stroke, failed speech and swallow evaluations, and is at high risk for aspiration. 

The patient received early goal-directed therapy for septic shock, which seems to have stabilized her condition. However, she is now experiencing fluid overload, as evidenced by an increased urine output (UOP) and stable creatinine levels. Lasix was continued to address this issue. 

The patient's mental status has worsened compared to her previous state. An MRI of the head showed continued evolution of the infarct, but no other new changes. She was started on cont aspirin and statin therapy. 

Her hypertension medications, metoprolol and lisinopril, were withheld due to hypotension, but one dose of metoprolol was tried with some decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. 

The patient has a history of goiter and low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, possibly due to a pituitary macroadenoma. Her free T4 levels were within normal range. 

She also has anemia at baseline, and her hypocalcemia resolved, although the exact cause is unclear. 

The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is being fed through a nasogastric"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient was extubated and showed improvement in respiratory status, but there was a subsequent decline in oxygenation. The patient has a history of sepsis, hypertension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pneumonia, and aspiration versus nosocomial infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as indicated by the decline in oxygenation after extubation. This may suggest the possibility of pneumonia or another respiratory infection. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory function and oxygenation levels is necessary.

2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and nerve dysfunction. Regular monitoring of electrolyte levels and appropriate management is essential.

3. Infection: The patient's history of sepsis and pneumonia indicates a risk for ongoing infection. It is crucial to evaluate and manage any potential sources of infection, such as pneumonia or a nosocomial infection.

4. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating fluid overload. This can contribute to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function. Monitoring fluid intake and output, along with adjusting the fluid regimen as necessary, is important.

5. Delirium: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**5-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Extubated [**2127-3-6**] -> ABGs improving
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, so will continue Lasix as
   UOP has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses, will cont at 500mg
   TID, hold for pH < 7.45
   - Goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   - Has periods of MAT, will incr metoprolol
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; A-line, would like to add PICC and d/c RIJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and pituitary adenoma. She was admitted with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status improved after being extubated, and she is expected to continue improving with diuresis. Her urine output has increased, and her creatinine level is not elevated. However, she is mildly fluid overloaded, so Lasix will be continued.

The patient is also experiencing septic shock, likely secondary to pneumonia. Early goal-directed therapy has been initiated, and the patient's lactate levels are trending down. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed, showing no ischemic changes, making cardiogenic shock less likely. Central adrenal insufficiency due to the pituitary macroadenoma is also less likely as her cortisol level is elevated on admission. The patient's troponin levels are slightly elevated, but this may be due to a leak.

The patient has altered mental status (AMS), which could be related to her recent right ACA stroke. However, she is less alert than before. An MRI of the head showed continued evolution of the infarct with no other new changes. The patient is being treated with aspirin and statin.

Metabolic alkalosis is present, possibly due to contraction alkalosis caused by Lasix. Acetazolamide has been started to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**5-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Extubated [**2127-3-6**] -> ABGs improving
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, so will continue Lasix as
   UOP has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses, will cont at 500mg
   TID, hold for pH < 7.45
   - Goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   - Has periods of MAT, will incr metoprolol
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; A-line, would like to add PICC and d/c RIJ
   # Code: presumed full
   # Communication: Patient's family
   # Disposition: to floor as respiratory status improves, PT c/s and CM

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and pituitary adenoma, admitted with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to known aspiration pneumonia from a nursing home. The patient has multifocal right lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and failed speech and swallow evaluation.

The patient's respiratory status is likely to improve with diuresis, and oxygen therapy can be weaned as tolerated. The patient has been extubated and ABGs are improving. The plan is to continue Lasix to address fluid overload.

The patient's shock is most likely septic shock secondary to pneumonia, but cardiogenic shock is less likely due to slightly elevated troponin levels, flat CK levels, and absence of ischemic changes on EKG. Early goal-directed therapy has been initiated and the patient appears to be stable now. Lactates are being followed and have trended down, indicating improvement. The patient may be mildly fluid overloaded, so Lasix will be continued.

The patient's mental status has worsened, and an MRI of the head showed continued evolution of the infarct with no new changes. Contingency plans for acute stroke and statin therapy have been made.

The patient continues to have metabolic alkalosis in the setting of Lasix, likely contraction alkalosis. Acetazolamide has been started at 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses and will be continued at 500 mg TID, holding for pH < 7.45. The goal urine output is > 150cc/hr.

The patient's hypertension has been managed by holding home medications of metoprolol and lisinopril. One dose of metoprolol has been tried with some decrease in heart rate and blood pressure, but will be held off until extubation and diuresis. The patient has periods of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and will increase metoprolol.

The patient has a goiter and low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level due to pituitary macroadenoma, but free T4 is within normal limits.

The patient has anemia at baseline in the mid-20s. The hematocrit (HCT) will be followed, and a complete blood count (CBC) will be performed.

The patient's hypocalcemia has resolved, but the cause is unclear. Ionized calcium is normal and stable.

The patient's fluid intake and output are being monitored closely, and repletion of electrolytes is ongoing. The target fluid balance is at goal.

Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's code status is full code. Disposition is to the floor as respiratory status improves, with plans for physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) consults and possible transfer to the medical care unit (MCU)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and pituitary adenoma. She was admitted with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to known aspiration pneumonia from a nursing home. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her recent ACA stroke and failure to speak and swallow, making her a high-risk candidate for aspiration. Urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) Legionella tests were negative. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for a 10-day course. Her respiratory status is expected to improve with diuresis, but it is complicated by metabolic alkalosis. Oxygen therapy is being weaned as tolerated, with a current FiO2 of 35%.

The patient also presented with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension upon admission, most likely due to septic shock secondary to pneumonia. Other possible causes, such as cardiogenic shock, have been ruled out based on normal cardiac enzyme levels and an unremarkable electrocardiogram (EKG). Central adrenal insufficiency due to the pituitary macroadenoma is less likely as cortisol levels were elevated on admission. Myocardial infarction has not been completely ruled out, although troponin levels may be elevated due to a leak. Early goal-directed therapy has been initiated, and the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**6-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis, but complicated by
   metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated, FiO2 50% -> 35%
   - One blood culture pos for Enterococcus, unsure of source, will speak
   with ID re: appropriate antibiotics
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent). R/o MI,
   although likely trop leak
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now 1.1
   - Still pos fluid balance for ICU stay, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, is now somewhat responsive to
   voice, which is an improvement
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - D/c acetazolamide as likely hypochloremic alkalosis, treat with KCl

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and pituitary adenoma. She was admitted with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia from a nursing home. The patient had recent speech and swallow difficulties and was not considered a good candidate for tube feeding. However, the family chose to continue feeding her, putting her at high risk for aspiration. Her urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) Legionella tests were negative.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/65 to 177/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. Her physical examination revealed scattered rales and ronchi in the right lung field, normal heart sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. She has a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Her extremities are warm, well perfused, and improving.

   PFI: Large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis and focus of
   consolidation at the left lung base. No acute abnormalities in the
   abdomen or
   pelvis. No evidence of infection.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from nursing home.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Vanc has been d/c
d. Will continue Zosyn while in house then switch
   to Moxifloxacin 400 mg daily on discharge for a total of 14 day course.
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis, but complicated by
   metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated, FiO2 50% -> 35%
   - One blood culture pos for Enterococcus, unsure of source, will speak
   with ID re: appropriate antibiotics
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent). R/o MI,
   although likely trop leak
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now 1.1
   - Still pos fluid balance for ICU stay, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, is now somewhat responsive to
   voice, which is an improvement
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - D/c acetazolamide as likely hypochloremic alkalosis, treat with KCl
   PRN
   - Cont goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Cont home dose metoprolol with good control of BP and tachycardia
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma
   - Restart Synthroid
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an elderly female with a history of right anterior cerebral artery stroke and pituitary adenoma.
- She was admitted with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient has been on invasive ventilation and is currently weaned off.
- Blood cultures showed positive results for Enterococcus and Clostridium, leading to the need for abdominal drainage.
- A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis and a focus of consolidation at the left lung base, but no acute abnormalities in the abdomen or pelvis.
- The patient's respiratory status is likely to improve with diuresis, but complicated by metabolic alkalosis.
- The patient's blood pressure is stable, and she is being weaned off oxygen.
- One blood culture is positive for Enterococcus, and the source is unknown.
- The patient likely has septic shock secondary to pneumonia, although cardiogenic shock is less likely.
- Early goal-directed therapy has been initiated, and the patient's lactate levels have trended down.
- The patient has a history of right anterior cerebral artery stroke and is somewhat responsive to voice, an improvement.
- An MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, with no other new changes.
- The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which is likely contraction alkalosis due to Lasix use.
- The patient's hypertension is being managed with home medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**6-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis, but complicated by
   metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated, FiO2 50% -> 35%
   - One blood culture pos for Enterococcus, unsure of source, will speak
   with ID re: appropriate antibiotics
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent). R/o MI,
   although likely trop leak
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now 1.1
   - Still pos fluid balance for ICU stay, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, is now somewhat responsive to
   voice, which is an improvement
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - D/c acetazolamide as likely hypochloremic alkalosis, treat with KCl
   PRN
   - Cont goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Cont home dose metoprolol with good control of BP and tachycardia
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma
   - Restart Synthroid
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PICC line, A-line
   # Code: presumed full
   # Communication: Patient's family
   # Disposition: Pt has bed at [**Hospital 858**] Rehab, will discuss transfer with
   CM and family

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and pituitary adenoma. She was admitted with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is hypoxic with a chest X-ray showing multifocal right lobe infiltrate. She has failed speech and swallow due to recent ACA stroke and is at high risk for aspiration. Urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) Legionella negative.

2. Shock: The patient was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. Most likely septic shock secondary to pneumonia. Less likely cardiogenic (elevated troponin levels, flat CK levels, EKG without ischemic changes). Central adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma is less likely as cortisol levels are elevated on admission. Rule out myocardial infarction, although troponin leak likely. Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now.

3. Acute Mental/Motor Syndrome (AMS): History of right ACA stroke recently, now somewhat responsive to voice, which is an improvement. MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes. Continue aspirin and statin.

4. Metabolic alkalosis: Continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix, likely contraction"
