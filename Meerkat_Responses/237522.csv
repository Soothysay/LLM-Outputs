   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 79-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU following a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She has a history of multiple orthopedic fractures, acute renal failure, and previous surgeries including spleenectomy and gastrointestinal (GI) tube perforation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy tube with assisted ventilation.

The patient has been receiving various medications including amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, heparin for prophylaxis, pantoprazole, and sedatives such as hydromorphone and lorazepam. She has also been receiving intravenous fluids, including normal saline, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and citrate dextrose for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal several injuries, including a displaced coronoid process fracture, small avulsion fracture versus calcific tendinitis in the common extensor tendon, bibasilar airspace consolidation, increased free fluid in the pelvis, and multiple rib fractures. There is no evidence of"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 79-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She has undergone several surgeries, including spleenectomy and repair of gastrointestinal tube perforation. The patient also has multiple orthopedic fractures and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Neurologic: On Dilaudid for pain and Ativan for anxiety as needed.
- Cardiovascular: Pressure stabilized, off pressors, but still on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
- Pulmonary: Tracheostomy in place, small pleural effusions, and adequate oxygenation. Ventilator weaning is being attempted.
- Gastrointestinal/Abdomen: Postoperative ileus/constipation with nasogastric (NG) tube and feeding tube in place. Lactulose and mineral oil are being given through the feeding tube until bowel sounds return.
- Renal: Foley catheterized, CVVHD target negative 50/hr, anuric (no urine output).
- Hematology: Hematocrit (Hct) stable.
- Endocrine: Radiation-induced secondary immune suppression (RISS).
- Infectious Disease: Ciprofloxacin and fluconazole for Enterobacter infection, with yeast coverage.
- Lines/Tubes/Drains: Foley catheter, NG tube, feeding tube, tracheost"
